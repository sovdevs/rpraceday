🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-9 under rules but hinted at promise in these blinkers latest; going left-handed can help
🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 under rules but hinted at promise in these blinkers at Exeter (2m7f, good) a fortnight ago, where he jumped to the left and faded into a 17l fourth; the return to a left-handed track and drop back down in trip could be firm positives and he's one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing at Newcastle last month but perhaps that run came too soon, just eight days after a 10l win over this C&D (good to soft) in a first-time visor (retained since); could bounce back with bold show.

💬 Comment: 0-6 over hurdles but today's trip could suit this two-time Flat winner; possible contender
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 0-6 over hurdles when well beaten at Musselburgh (3m, good to soft) in November; however, she won twice on the Flat at Musselburgh (1m6f/2m, good/good to soft) in October and ran okay on AW three weeks ago after a break; this trip may suit now back hurdling; possible contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up in November on last hurdle start; hasn't shone on AW over the winter
🔦 Spotlight: Won on the Flat last September but at a lowly level and pulled up over C&D in November on last hurdle start; hasn't shone on AW over the winter and others appeal more; cheekpieces return (no positive impact previously).

💬 Comment: Has shown very little but goes handicapping off a basement mark; check the betting
🔦 Spotlight: He's shown very little this winter when triple-figure odds for his first three starts; improvement needed but he goes handicapping off basement mark and his dam was a 2m4f hurdle winner (RPR 84); check the betting.
