🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came from a long way back to finish fourth of 19 on handicap debut at Navan
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden efforts on the AW not devoid of promise and he duly ran an eyecatching race on handicap debut at Navan (1m2f) where he was beaten under 3l into fourth (of 19) after coming from a long way back; the winner of that race probably resented the soft ground when behind Birdie Time on his next start; major player.

🔦 Spotlight: Certainly no worse for the new visor when fifth of 19 at Navan (1m2f, good; handicap debut), where his effort only flattened out late on and was just behind Angelo Pio; not without a chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Found only one too good in a field of 16 on handicap debut at Gowran (1m, heavy), though was no match for the winner; that's something he might build on, provided he handles this different ground and stays the trip.
