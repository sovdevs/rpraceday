🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Showed early promise for Dominic Ffrench Davis, potentially interesting  for in-form team
🔦 Spotlight: Regressive last season after finishing second to the subsequent Queen Mary sixth Xanthe in a 5f Ascot novice contest on the second of three starts for Dominic Ffrench Davis; mid-division in the Windsor Castle; interesting here for the in-form Murray/Aguiar team if his ability has been rekindled by a change of scene.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten a length and a half in fourth behind a 76-rated colt on debut, definite chance
🔦 Spotlight: Just 11-2 for her debut over 6f here in December and was only beaten a length and a half in fourth behind the 76-rated winning favourite; was keen early and shorter trip may help her settle; however, third-placed Just Jump finished behind Tino Pai here last time.

🔦 Spotlight: Just 11-2 for her debut over 6f here in December and was only beaten a length and a half in fourth behind the 76-rated winning favourite; was keen early and shorter trip may help her settle; however, third-placed Just Jump finished behind Tino Pai here last time.

💬 Comment: Showed early promise for Dominic Ffrench Davis, potentially interesting  for in-form team
🔦 Spotlight: Regressive last season after finishing second to the subsequent Queen Mary sixth Xanthe in a 5f Ascot novice contest on the second of three starts for Dominic Ffrench Davis; mid-division in the Windsor Castle; interesting here for the in-form Murray/Aguiar team if his ability has been rekindled by a change of scene.

💬 Comment: Beaten a length and a half in fourth behind a 76-rated colt on debut, definite chance
🔦 Spotlight: Just 11-2 for her debut over 6f here in December and was only beaten a length and a half in fourth behind the 76-rated winning favourite; was keen early and shorter trip may help her settle; however, third-placed Just Jump finished behind Tino Pai here last time.
