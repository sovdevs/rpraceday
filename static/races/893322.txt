🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Decent level of form in bumpers of late, likely major player now sent hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: Decent level of form in bumpers, winning on debut at Naas and better effort in defeat when placed at both Leopardstown and Limerick; should make his mark hurdling and could be the one to beat in this ordinary maiden.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Naas (15.5f): "Eternal Echo is a nice horse and has shown a bit of pace at home. To give the filly a stone was a good performance. He could definitely win on the Flat - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Limerick third rates a major player on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 1m4f maiden at Galway last September (rated 80); took a nice step forward on second attempt hurdling when a clear third at Limerick last month behind two market principals; definitely one to consider.
Horse quote: 2024-09-10 at Galway (12f): "Dark Oak has won a maiden now. We might go for a Flat handicap and then hurdling. She is very big and will be better in another year - Joe Murphy, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Dam Jacksonslady won eight races for this stable and was third in the Galway Plate; promising hurdles debut in decent Navan 4yo maiden last month, despite running keen when fourth (third has won since); all the better for that, especially if settling better.
