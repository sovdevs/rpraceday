💬 Comment: Won well at Wetherby (5.5f) in new visor last Sunday; obvious appeal despite penalty.
🔦 Spotlight: Revitalised by the first-time visor (retained) and return to turf when running away with a Wetherby handicap on Sunday (5.5f, good to firm); quick turnround is no issue for one who has obliged after just one day's absence before, and his appeal is clear to see despite the penalty.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: This is slightly easier than the Bath 0-80 (5f, good to firm) he was second in last week.
🔦 Spotlight: Winless away from AW, but last week's second in a Bath 0-80 (5f, good to firm) was one of his better turf efforts and this race is slightly easier; needs to back that up.
Horse quote: 2024-07-07 at Chelmsford (AW) (5f): "The Thames Boatman needs pace in his races and looking at this race beforehand I knew he'd get that today, so that was an advantage. He's at his best when he has something to aim at, but he made life harder for himself by hanging in the last half a furlong. We do think he's a smart horse, especially on the all-weather - Finley Marsh, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only 1-30 but competitive again last time, despite getting bumped late on.
🔦 Spotlight: Poor return of 1-30 for one of his ability, though he has been competitive of late and may have gone even closer at Catterick last week without taking a few bumps; livelier place claims than some.
Horse quote: 2021-06-11 at Sandown (5f): "We always thought a lot of Mojomaker and there was a reason we took him to the Lily Agnes first time out at Chester as we thought he was good enough to win there. He didn't handle the track on the day but he left that well and truly behind at Goodwood last time. I think he should have won but he threw the race away. He can hang a bit and be a bit of a lad but we put a new bit on his bridle today and it has worked a treat. Pat (Cosgrave, jockey) got off him at Goodwood and said he would love to run him over five furlongs at Sandown. We were very bullish coming down. There is a Listed race back here next month and we will probably look at something like that ahead of the Molecomb at Goodwood - David Loughnane, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f winner here yesterday, in an apprentice event so he does not have to carry a penalty.
🔦 Spotlight: He's had more success away from turf but has now won on the last two occasions he's encountered it, which was over 5f (soft) in the autumn and 7f at Brighton (good to firm) yesterday; both were under Jack Doughty and the latter was in an apprentice event, so he does not have to carry a penalty and must enter serious calculations.
Horse quote: 2024-10-31 at Bath (5f): "Jack [Doughty] gave Mumayaz a lovely ride. He's been consistent all year. He had a great all-weather campaign and we've been very pleased with him - Tony Carroll, trainer."

💬 Comment: Ran flat on handicap debut but absence since isn't a concern; yard is in rare form.
🔦 Spotlight: Tapeta/heavy 5f novice winner with scope on pedigree for staying further; unseen since running flat on November's handicap debut, but has already proved capable of defying an absence; yard in rare form.

🔦 Spotlight: Looks a bit between trips just now, keeping on over Lingfield's Polytrack 6f before failing to see out 7f there latest; not beaten far on either occasion, so a further 2lb drop is a welcome surprise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not far off at Windsor on Monday; would be feared more over the extended 5f here
🔦 Spotlight: Monday night's Windsor second (5f) was his best run of 2025; last four successes have been gained over the extended 5f here (soft, good) and there have been no wins over further than that since autumn 2021.
Horse quote: 2021-02-04 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "Secret Handsheikh was a convincing winner last time and went up 9lb but he loves this surface. He skips off the surface and has such a good attitude - Hollie Doyle, jockey."
