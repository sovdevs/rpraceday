🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Strong form contender if he can shrug aside last week's desperate run at Kelso
🔦 Spotlight: Jumped poorly and ran no race when tailed off at Kelso last week; had previously made it 4-10 over fences when winning well at Haydock (2m, soft; stays this far) and clearly a strong contender if he can shrug aside that recent disappointment.

🔦 Spotlight: Had form in Ireland on soft ground but all three chase wins have been on good, the latest at Doncaster in November (2m3f; 2lb lower); laboured in two runs since (on good and soft) but this is at least a drop in grade; the weather needs checking.
