💬 Comment: Just minor promise thus far but should be a different proposition now handicapping
🔦 Spotlight: Best effort in three 2m maidens was his 28l fifth of ten runners behind the smart Regent's Stroll at Newbury in November; could be a very different proposition in this low-grade handicap and a tongue-tie is added.

🔦 Spotlight: Had been quiet over hurdles but went off favourite for his handicap debut at Ayr (2m5f, soft) and showed enough to believe he can win races off this sort of mark; the drop back in trip could benefit.
