🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Denied clear run at Down Royal; 🔥 big player given better luck in running
🔦 Spotlight: Some promise on sole Flat outing in August before switched to hurdles, shaping well in first-time hood at Cork and ran much better than result infers on latest at Down Royal, losing momentum when denied an opening approaching two out, keeping on; tongue-tie added here and 🔥 big player given better luck in running.

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden form nothing to write home about but was running a much better race and held place prospects when coming to grief at the last (usual two out) in Down Royal all-aged handicap last time; not one to rule out back against her peers.
