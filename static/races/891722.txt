🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: If she can find some fluency back chasing in the new headgear then she should run well
🔦 Spotlight: Went close in her first chase but jumping held her back in her next two; returned to hurdles for last three starts, outpaced before staying on again over Wetherby's extended 2m3f last time having previously run better at 3m, especially when second at Haydock; if she can find some fluency back chasing in the new headgear then she should run well.
Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Wetherby (19.5f): "Lady In The Park has improved in the last month or so. She has possibilities of going on to be okay. She wants further - Peter Scudamore, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Last three efforts are worrying but back from a break and he has the form to feature
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winner who was runner-up three times in a row last May-July, including over C&D; needs to rediscover that level of form, however.
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Ayr (20.5f): "Everyday Champagne wants nice ground and I thought today would be too sharp for him. He arrived in great fettle from Nicky (Richards) and I don't really know how much he'll come on for it as I don't know him well enough to tell you to be honest - Nick Alexander, trainer, speaking to RTV"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handicapped about right but should be on the premises now back over a better trip
🔦 Spotlight: Tailed off at Wexford 20 days ago but that was over 2m3f and had been running well in chases over 3m+; handicapped about right but should be on the premises; usual cheekpieces replaced by blinkers in which he has been competitive.
Horse quote: 2021-12-29 at Leopardstown (21f): "I thought Siberian Star was very good. Philip [Rothwell]  just said to take my time on him and luckily they've gone a good gallop in front. I was a bit worried about the ground but it was grand in fairness to him. He just kept creeping away and finished out well at the line. Philip was hopeful after the last day, once the ground hadn't gone against him he felt he should run a big race - Paddy O'Hanlon, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Some long absences in his profile and pulled up in maiden hurdle last time after 417 days away; however, his best form doesn't read at all badly with a view to this mark and he should make a chaser (fell on debut in early 2023); wears first-time cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still competitive when falling three out on stable debut at Leicester; some stamina doubts
🔦 Spotlight: Unlikely that she would have won as others were going better, but was running well when falling three out in a mares' chase at Leicester (2m4f, good to soft; stable debut); didn't entirely convince on her previous attempt at about 3m under rules but she won a point over this far.
Horse quote: 2024-03-31 at Market Rasen (16.5f): "Pitwood Road had already won a 10,000GBP bonus at Ayr so this is great and it's why we've been campaigning her in Britain. The bonus is fantastic for British owners and British-bred horses, so it's opened our eyes a bit. Derrick [Mossop] has been a great owner of mine for the last few years and he sends the younger horses to us so we can go to Britain and race. He left her with us this season and it's paid off, so hopefully she can stay - Terence O'Brien, trainer."

💬 Comment: Has won off a higher mark but he's struggled in both races after an absence
🔦 Spotlight: Only four runs back he won off 4lb higher but that was in late 2023 and he's struggled in both races after an absence; risky for now.
Horse quote: 2023-12-14 at Newcastle (23.5f): "I had a walk on the track earlier and I just felt like right down the inside was maybe where it was wettest so I tried to keep out in the middle. Court At Slip does whatever you want him to - if you want him come big for you he will do but if you leave him alone he's clever - William Easterby, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2023-03-26 at Carlisle (20f): "Uptown Harry ran terribly at Newcastle but the ground was jarring and he didn't let himself down on it, but he ran a solid race back here next time and we knew we were on the right track. We prayed for rain for a month and we managed to get it. We were pretty confident today. We knew he'd love the ground and he loves going right handed.
