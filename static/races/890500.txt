🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten on hurdle debut but things may click at some stage for this point winner
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner (3m, soft) who was a fair sixth on bumper debut at Aintree (2m1f, good) last October; two lesser runs have followed, most recently when soundly beaten third of five on hurdle debut at Carlisle (2m3f, good), but she's with a good yard (trainer runs two); things may click at some stage.
