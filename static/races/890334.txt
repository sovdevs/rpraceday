🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready success at Nottingham in sole 2yo outing; looks a useful prospect
🔦 Spotlight: Similar type to Falconer, having been successful at Nottingham (1m, heavy) in sole 2yo outing; did it readily by 6l and he looks a useful middle-distance prospect; warrants respect.
Horse quote: 2024-10-09 at Nottingham (8.5f): "It was an impressive performance. I was always confident that I was going to win quite well. Gethin just had a wander around when he got to the front but he's entitled to do that. He's gone through the line well. He's gone through that ground well. It would be nice to see him in the spring on better ground doing something similar, but he'll be a nice middle-distance horse. I don't think he needs to rush up in trip - Callum Rodriguez, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Strong promise in two AW contests; leading contender on the figures
🔦 Spotlight: Both starts over 1m on AW, scoring in good style at Southwell then finishing third in Kempton conditions race (winner is an exciting prospect); shapes as if he'll stay 1m2f; leading player on the figures.
Horse quote: 2024-12-14 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "It was a lovely performance. I thought Saddadd would be a bit green early on, which he was jumping out and finding his stride, but I got into a nice rhythm, a nice sort of pocket to teach him a bit about having horses either side of him. He took a little bit of winding up, but once he did get into top gear, and I had the rail to just help me out a bit, the penny started to drop late on and he finished off good - Jack Mitchell, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
