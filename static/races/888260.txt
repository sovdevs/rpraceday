🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4lb than for last month's defeat but was clear of the third and he's bang in form
🔦 Spotlight: Back from a break to rattle off a hat-trick (2m-2m4f), in two chases and a hurdle; came up short under a penalty when odds-on over C&D a month ago but was clear of the third; now 4lb higher but looks a good bet to give his running and get involved.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had dropped in the weights before his winning chase debut and no fluke about that
🔦 Spotlight: 0-4 in handicap hurdles but off a reduced mark he popped up on his chase debut at Taunton (2m2f, soft), with no apparent fluke about that (won going away by just over 2l); back up 6lb but could progress further as a chaser.

🔦 Spotlight: Good to see him complete last time and was only about 6l off the winner at Ffos Las (2m3f, heavy), where dropping back in trip helped; now 2lb lower than when a close second over hurdles here last April; may prefer softer ground but interesting otherwise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well at Taunton given his absence and having jumped to the left throughout
🔦 Spotlight: Finished about 10l behind Palawan Du Mazet at Taunton (2m2f, soft) but that was after a long layoff on only his third run over fences and he wasn't helped by jumping out to his left for the most part; could easily take a big step forward with that run under his belt and now going left handed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won over fences but last two chase runs not his best, or last time back hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: Dual chase winner but twice comfortably held in this discipline already this year and fared no better back off a lower hurdle mark last time; an 11yo now and easy to turn elsewhere.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Left former yard for £4,000 before finishing tailed off on stable debut at Market Rasen
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner; has failed to go on from a respectable first run over fences and left former yard for £4,000 before finishing tailed off on stable debut at Market Rasen two months ago; the tongue-tie tried there is absent this time with cheekpieces retained.
