💬 Comment: Made it 3-3 under Sean Bowen last time and a further 6lb rise looks manageable
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up after a bad mistake two runs back but has won his other four chases since October (2m4f-3m), last time at Market Rasen jumping well in front and winning with something to spare under hands and heels; that made it 3-3 under Sean Bowen and a further 6lb rise looks manageable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off since pulling up in December but he's temptingly treated if he's back in good form
🔦 Spotlight: Absent since late December when pulled up first-time cheekpieces which are now discarded; had begun chasing career with two good thirds in October (3m/3m1f, good) and temptingly treated if he's back in good form.
