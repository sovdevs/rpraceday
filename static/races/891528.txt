💬 Comment: 50-1 at Yarmouth (1m2f, good) but bustled up the winner, Regal Agenda 5l back in fourth
🔦 Spotlight: Late foal, by Kodiac; 50-1 for six-runner novice at Yarmouth (1m2f, good) three weeks ago but came from towards the rear to bustle up the winner; after that bright start, with today's form rival Regal Agenda 5l back in fourth, and the third and first fighting it out at Sandown on Friday, this 4yo looks the one to beat.

💬 Comment: 2nd at Yarmouth (1m, soft) in October but Clermont Ferrand beat her 5l there (1m2f, good)
🔦 Spotlight: From a good family that has served her owner well; second at Yarmouth (1m, soft) in October makes her one of the top two on form in this line-up, but the other one is Clermont Ferrand who beat her by 5l back at Yarmouth (1m2f, good) three weeks ago; made most that day; needs to bounce back.

🔦 Spotlight: 12-1, never-dangerous sixth of 12 in maiden at Wolverhampton (8.6f, AW) in November but she kept on well; there's lots to like in her pedigree and it will be disappointing if she can't leave that form behind her this term.
