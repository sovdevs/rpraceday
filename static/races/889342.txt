💬 Comment: Solid handicap form at 2m latest; needs to prove 2m3f suits; cheekpieces fitted
🔦 Spotlight: Made the running for both hurdle wins (2m, soft) last winter; has found life harder in handicaps but better treated now and he was anything but a pushover for one on a three-timer at Lingfield (2m, soft) last month; trip query back at 2m3f with cheekpieces fitted but still respected.

🔦 Spotlight: He didn't have much luck over hurdles in Ireland but has won two out of four for this yard, finding plenty when having another go over 2m2f, at Stratford (good to soft) this month; could do better yet but he'll need to, being up 5lb in a stronger race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked likely handicap prospect but it didn't come off at Sandown; bred to appreciate 2m3f
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who looked a likely handicap prospect on his novice and maiden form at about 2m but his handicap debut in a military riders' race at Sandown (2m, soft; favourite) in January didn't go to plan; still early days though and 2m3f promises to suit on pedigree.

🔦 Spotlight: Record of 1-8 (2m1f, very soft) over hurdles in France; fair yard debut at Sandown (2m, soft) in February but he had a stiff task at Newbury next time and was pulled up after three out; has run well in cheekpieces which are added today; not ruled out with sights lowered.
