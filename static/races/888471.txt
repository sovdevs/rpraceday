🔦 Spotlight: Yet to add to his debut success but he has been in good form since switched to AW, going desperately close at Chelmsford and over C&D and then only giving best to two more patiently ridden rivals over C&D last month; 🔥 big player off this mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form dipped last time but he's the type to bounce back; hard to win with though
🔦 Spotlight: Finally put his head back in front at Lingfield in January, only to be disqualified for weighing in light; runner-up on his next three starts but his form dipped at Wolverhampton last month; type to bounce back quickly.
