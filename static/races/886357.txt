🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on Flat with good third at Southwell (1m3f) but this is a different test at 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Well held over hurdles in final two runs last year but he returned to the Flat with eyecatching third at Southwell (1m3f) last month; now drops back in grade but he's untried beyond 1m4f and stamina could be an issue in this competitive race; visor removed and cheekpieces return.

💬 Comment: Four-time course winner but he's not easy to predict and was never involved here last time
🔦 Spotlight: All four wins have been at this track and latest was over C&D in November 2023; well treated on best form last year but he's not easy to predict and was never involved here (1m6f) last month; needs to step up again after that and slow starts have been a recurring theme; change of headgear.

💬 Comment: Back on Flat with good third at Southwell (1m3f) but this is a different test at 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Well held over hurdles in final two runs last year but he returned to the Flat with eyecatching third at Southwell (1m3f) last month; now drops back in grade but he's untried beyond 1m4f and stamina could be an issue in this competitive race; visor removed and cheekpieces return.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on Flat with good third at Southwell (1m3f) but this is a different test at 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Well held over hurdles in final two runs last year but he returned to the Flat with eyecatching third at Southwell (1m3f) last month; now drops back in grade but he's untried beyond 1m4f and stamina could be an issue in this competitive race; visor removed and cheekpieces return.

🔦 Spotlight: All four wins have been at this track and latest was over C&D in November 2023; well treated on best form last year but he's not easy to predict and was never involved here (1m6f) last month; needs to step up again after that and slow starts have been a recurring theme; change of headgear.

💬 Comment: Back on Flat with good third at Southwell (1m3f) but this is a different test at 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Well held over hurdles in final two runs last year but he returned to the Flat with eyecatching third at Southwell (1m3f) last month; now drops back in grade but he's untried beyond 1m4f and stamina could be an issue in this competitive race; visor removed and cheekpieces return.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark (13th attempt) with easy win at Wolverhampton (1m6f) in December but vulnerable in both runs since including a well-held third at Southwell last time; bit to prove again and he's untried at this trip.

🔦 Spotlight: All four wins have been at this track and latest was over C&D in November 2023; well treated on best form last year but he's not easy to predict and was never involved here (1m6f) last month; needs to step up again after that and slow starts have been a recurring theme; change of headgear.
