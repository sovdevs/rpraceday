💬 Comment: Placed in 1m6f Flat maiden in France in October; makes stable/hurdle debut today
🔦 Spotlight: Did not live up to his smart Flat pedigree during three-race spell in France in the autumn but was placed in Compiegne maiden (1m6f, heavy) on his second start; subsequently changed hands for 32,000euros; the market may guide before this stable/hurdle debut.
