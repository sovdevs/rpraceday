🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second and first in two Irish points; interesting recruit for new stable; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 16l into second of 11 behind a useful subsequent bumper/hurdle winner in an Irish mares' maiden point at the end of 2023 and had little difficulty in going one better on her return in a similar contest in October; picked up for £30,000 the following month and looks an interesting recruit for new stable; respected.

🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning debut in an Irish mares maiden point last March and showed promise when third of ten on hurdle debut at Clonmel (2m, yielding) in May, but hasn't gone on from that and failed to complete in two starts back in points at the end of the year; interesting to see how she fares in the market on stable debut (same owner).
