üî¶ Spotlight: Ninth (faded) in last year's Pertemps Final over hurdles here when 4lb higher; hasn't produced best form over fences but didn't run badly over 3m3f at Punchestown latest and this lightly raced 7yo represents a top Irish yard with a good record in this race; cheekpieces go on; not written off.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Stayed on well over 3m at Ascot last month and today's extra yardage could be a plus
üî¶ Spotlight: Has an in-and-out profile and his jumping can be an issue; however, he did well to rally for a cosy win after a slow jump at the final fence on his reappearance at Newbury (extended 2m6f, good to soft) in November, and the manner in which he stayed on for a fair sixth at Ascot (3m, good) last month suggests today's extra yardage will be a positive; interesting.
