🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a handy mark on course hurdles form but on long losing run and return to form is needed
🔦 Spotlight: Displayed some aptitude for chasing back in March 2022 (his last run in this sphere) and he's on a handy mark judged on hurdle form here in November 2024; however, he hasn't been at his best on his last three hurdle starts (two here) and remains without a win since March 2021.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced point runner-up who is a possible 🚀 improver now switched to fences
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten this year in first two handicap hurdles (2m4f/3m, soft) but he was runner-up in a point (on good to yielding) and the switch to fences, the forecast better ground and first-time cheekpieces are all possible sources of improvement for this lightly raced 8yo.
