🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Escapes a penalty for Saturday's 5l win in an apprentice handicap at Southwell
🔦 Spotlight: Went very close here (1m4f) in September on handicap debut and bounced back from lesser run here (1m6f) last month to win by 5l at Southwell (1m4f, Tapeta) on Saturday; that was an apprentice handicap so she escapes a penalty, and will be very hard to beat if backing up that performance.
