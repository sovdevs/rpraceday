üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Last season's Triumph H'dle runner-up; may have needed comeback run; could be on good mark
üî¶ Spotlight: Runner-up in 4yo Grade 1 hurdles here (C&D Triumph, heavy) and at Aintree (2m1f, soft) last spring before winning one at Punchestown (2m, soft); this headstrong sort was second at 2-5 on belated comeback in mares' Grade 2 at Ascot (1m7f, good) in January but may have needed the run; stable has an excellent record in this race and Paul Townend rides; could be on a good mark.

üí¨ Comment: Ran well in Grade 2 Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton last month and he's a possible player
üî¶ Spotlight: Won Newbury handicap (2m, good to soft) in December 2023; beaten nearly 5l when third of four in the Grade 2 at Wincanton last month (1m7f, good to soft) from which the clear one-two were fortunate to fill the same positions in Tuesday's Champion Hurdle; it was a creditable run from this fellow in the face of a tough task and he's a possible player in first-time cheekpieces.

üí¨ Comment: Front-runner; excuses last twice; has run well on both his visits here; interesting
üî¶ Spotlight: Front-runner who isn't obviously well treated and has been soundly beaten the last twice, but he went off hard on the first occasion and soft ground may not have suited last time (when his usual tongue-tie was missing; it returns today); in good form previously on good/good to soft and has run really well on both his visits here; there might not be much competition for the lead and he could make a bold bid at a big price if conditions suit.
