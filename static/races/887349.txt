🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last season's Triumph H'dle runner-up; may have needed comeback run; could be on good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in 4yo Grade 1 hurdles here (C&D Triumph, heavy) and at Aintree (2m1f, soft) last spring before winning one at Punchestown (2m, soft); this headstrong sort was second at 2-5 on belated comeback in mares' Grade 2 at Ascot (1m7f, good) in January but may have needed the run; stable has an excellent record in this race and Paul Townend rides; could be on a good mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's Fred Winter winner; no threat on either run since but remains of interest
🔦 Spotlight: Convincing win in the Fred Winter 4yo Handicap here (2m, heavy) 12 months ago; hasn't threatened on either run since (May/December) but previous Festival form has to be respected and he could be well treated if rediscovering last March's promise; ran well on good to yielding on the Flat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this 12 months ago; should still have mileage in his mark judged on classy Flat form
🔦 Spotlight: Won this last March (heavy) on last hurdle outing; now 8lb higher and Paul Townend is on stablemate Kargese this time, but he travelled well 12 months ago and there's still mileage in his mark judged on his classy Flat form (close fifth in the Melbourne Cup in November when last seen); effective on any ground; can play another leading role.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in two big h'caps last year; back from a break but could be an each-way contender
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable third to Lark In The Mornin in the Fred Winter 4yo Handicap here (2m, heavy) last March and 7l second of 19 in the Galway Hurdle (2m, good) in August; absent since heavy defeat on the Flat in the Cesarewitch in October but he's an each-way contender if back on song for this comeback.

💬 Comment: Easy maiden win at Punchestown; tough task back in handicap but could have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Tailed off on handicap hurdle debut at Leopardstown (2m, yielding) in December then easily made all in maiden at Punchestown (2m, heavy); back into a tough handicap today and jockey bookings suggest he's not his top yard's chief hope, but this 5yo showed strong form in a hot handicap at Royal Ascot (good to firm) last June and he could have more to offer in this code.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Front-runner; excuses last twice; has run well on both his visits here; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who isn't obviously well treated and has been soundly beaten the last twice, but he went off hard on the first occasion and soft ground may not have suited last time (when his usual tongue-tie was missing; it returns today); in good form previously on good/good to soft and has run really well on both his visits here; there might not be much competition for the lead and he could make a bold bid at a big price if conditions suit.

💬 Comment: Won the Morebattle a fortnight ago but loves Kelso; down the field on sole visit here
🔦 Spotlight: Won the big-field Morebattle Hurdle at Kelso (2m, good to soft) a fortnight ago for the second year running and now chases a £100,000 bonus under a 5lb penalty; however, he loves Kelso and finished down the field in the Greatwood here in November on his sole run at Cheltenham.
