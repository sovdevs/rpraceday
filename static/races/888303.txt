🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won quite comfortably over 2m here a week ago and commands respect under 7lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent for Gary and Josh Moore this season, albeit often in plating company, and drew clear to win fairly comfortably here (2m, good) for new stable a week ago; has 7lb penalty to carry today but will be fine over the long trip and needs to be taken very seriously.

🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles at 11th attempt, making virtually all for ready success at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) in December, and has been placed at same track twice since (2m3f/2m); today's faster ground should also suit and he may do better still; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual Flat winner; only beaten about 9l on recent handicap hurdle debut; a possible
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Flat winner who has shown some aptitude for hurdling this season; raced a bit too freely when fifth on recent handicap debut at Catterick (2m3f, good to soft) but was only beaten about 9l; could have a say.

💬 Comment: Posted sound effort when placed over C&D last month but last hurdle win was in 2022
🔦 Spotlight: Kept on well for third over C&D (good to soft) six weeks ago and won't be far away if in similar form again but this regressive 8yo has not won over hurdles since 2022 and others in the line-up appeal more.
