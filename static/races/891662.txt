🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Showed ability on debut but clearly vulnerable to anything with proper potential
🔦 Spotlight: Cheekpieces fitted for both runs; appeared to find 1m too sharp when fifth of eight at Southwell (AW) and then finished well behind in a classy 1m2f novice at Newbury; clearly vulnerable to anything with proper potential.
