🔦 Spotlight: Doctor Dino filly got off the mark over hurdles in France at the fourth attempt when running away with 2m2f Auteuil fillies' Listed contest in June on soft; that form is suspect but she possibly didn't handle quicker ground on Irish debut at Leopardstown on St Stephen's Day; respected for top handler.
