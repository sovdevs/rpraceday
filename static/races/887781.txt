🔦 Spotlight: Doctor Dino filly got off the mark over hurdles in France at the fourth attempt when running away with 2m2f Auteuil fillies' Listed contest in June on soft; that form is suspect but she possibly didn't handle quicker ground on Irish debut at Leopardstown on St Stephen's Day; respected for top handler.

🔦 Spotlight: AW winner in France; encouraging debut over hurdles at Limerick when he would have been closer but for a mistake at the last; has 12lb pull in the weights with runner-up Bacchanalian for 2.5l beating factoring in Oakley Brown's claim; bumped into Willie Mullins-trained runner when second over C&D latest and the fourth won since; stable won this race last year; big chance.
