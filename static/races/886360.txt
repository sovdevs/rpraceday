🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Too free (1m4f) latest but should have the pace to get involved now dropping back to 7f.
🔦 Spotlight: His three better efforts have seen him placed second each time, including here over 1m and 1m2f; raced too freely over 1m4f at Wolverhampton latest but his style of running suggests he'll have the pace to be heavily involved now returning to 7f for the first time since his debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Too free (1m4f) latest but should have the pace to get involved now dropping back to 7f.
🔦 Spotlight: His three better efforts have seen him placed second each time, including here over 1m and 1m2f; raced too freely over 1m4f at Wolverhampton latest but his style of running suggests he'll have the pace to be heavily involved now returning to 7f for the first time since his debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Too free (1m4f) latest but should have the pace to get involved now dropping back to 7f.
🔦 Spotlight: His three better efforts have seen him placed second each time, including here over 1m and 1m2f; raced too freely over 1m4f at Wolverhampton latest but his style of running suggests he'll have the pace to be heavily involved now returning to 7f for the first time since his debut.
