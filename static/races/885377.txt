💬 Comment: Has resumed improvement; on a hat-trick and now looks well worth a crack at 3m
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row last March and resumed improvement this winter on his last three starts, on last two occasions scoring at Leicester over 2m4f and an extended 2m6f; three of those wins were on soft, one on heavy; had to see off a determined challenge from his market rival last time (up 5lb today) and now looks well worth a crack at 3m.

💬 Comment: More to prove if it's soft ground but he won well in small fields on two of his last three
🔦 Spotlight: Won his only start on soft but has performed to a higher level on better ground since, notably on all three starts this season; that includes when he won well over about 3m in small fields at Southwell (good) and Doncaster (good to soft; first-time cheekpieces) and going up another 4lb since latest start may underestimate him.

💬 Comment: Below best this term but still managed 2nd at Haydock and 13l fourth in the Welsh National
🔦 Spotlight: Familiar big-race contender who's not been at his best this season but still managed second over an extended 3m1f at Haydock and 13l fourth in the Welsh National at Chepstow (near 3m7f, soft); cheekpieces (tried once last term, pulled up) return; dropped another 2lb and respected but he probably needs to be back in peak form.

🔦 Spotlight: Long absence before winning two five-runner handicaps late in 2023 when switched to chasing, latterly over an extended 2m7f at Newbury (soft); something amiss last February but he went well long way when reappearing at Newbury (3m2f) six weeks ago and looks a player if that has put him right.

💬 Comment: Has resumed improvement; on a hat-trick and now looks well worth a crack at 3m
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row last March and resumed improvement this winter on his last three starts, on last two occasions scoring at Leicester over 2m4f and an extended 2m6f; three of those wins were on soft, one on heavy; had to see off a determined challenge from his market rival last time (up 5lb today) and now looks well worth a crack at 3m.

💬 Comment: More to prove if it's soft ground but he won well in small fields on two of his last three
🔦 Spotlight: Won his only start on soft but has performed to a higher level on better ground since, notably on all three starts this season; that includes when he won well over about 3m in small fields at Southwell (good) and Doncaster (good to soft; first-time cheekpieces) and going up another 4lb since latest start may underestimate him.

🔦 Spotlight: Familiar big-race contender who's not been at his best this season but still managed second over an extended 3m1f at Haydock and 13l fourth in the Welsh National at Chepstow (near 3m7f, soft); cheekpieces (tried once last term, pulled up) return; dropped another 2lb and respected but he probably needs to be back in peak form.

💬 Comment: Irish challenger; scored on soft over 3m2f and 3m4f last season; well beaten this term
🔦 Spotlight: Irish challenger; raced usually at Fairyhouse, the scene of four of his five wins; scored on soft over 3m2f and 3m4f last season, whereas he's been well beaten on both starts this term and seems to have a tough British mark.

💬 Comment: Partial revival last time; 12lb below peak mark but he's unraced beyond 2m6f under rules
🔦 Spotlight: More miss than hit over the last year or so, his good runs when fourth over about 2m4f at Cheltenham and Punchestown; partial revival with the addition of cheekpieces three weeks ago and now his usual tongue-tie returns; 12lb below his peak mark but he's unraced beyond 2m6f under rules.
