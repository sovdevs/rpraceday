🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third on handicap debut in January and has moved yards; has to be of interest
🔦 Spotlight: 1m2f winner for William Haggas; only had four races over hurdles and was a rallying third on handicap debut at Taunton (2m, soft; first-time cheekpieces over hurdles); looks capable of winning races for new trainer Neil Mulholland.

🔦 Spotlight: His thirds at Uttoxeter were quite remote, as was his fourth when only 5-1 for his handicap debut there in November (on soft); presumably thought capable of a bit better.

🔦 Spotlight: Consistent and capable under both codes when with Alan King; has yet to reach the frame on seven starts for this stable, trying fences the last time; has a lot to prove right now.
Horse quote: 2023-05-12 at Chester (12.5f): "Greystoke had been in good form on the AW and he was going to go hurdling, but I couldn't find the right race for him so he came here. I was worried about the rain and I'd have been more confident on good ground - Alan King, trainer."
