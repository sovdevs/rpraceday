🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready winner of this last year; again hard to beat if none the worse for heavy fall latest
🔦 Spotlight: Successful at the last two Cheltenham Festivals, latterly a ready winner of this on heavy ground; took her 2m4f record to 3-3 (all Grade 1s) when proving too strong for Teahupoo in the Hatton's Grace at Fairyhouse (yielding) on reappearance in November; second to Constitution Hill back at 2m in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton next time and narrowly ahead of State Man when departing four out in the Irish Champion at Leopardstown last month; hard to beat if none the worse for that heavy tumble.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved again to win Grade 3 on return; more to come and the chief threat to Lossiemouth
🔦 Spotlight: This classy mare's only defeat from five starts for Willie Mullins was when fourth to Golden Ace in the Dawn Run at this meeting last year; relished the step back up in trip when a dominant winner of a Grade 1 mares' novice at Fairyhouse (2m4f, heavy) on her final start last season and she returned to give weight and a beating to five rivals in the Grade 3 Quevega at Punchestown (2m4f, soft) 19 days ago; further progress is likely and she can give stablemate Lossiemouth most to do.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Saw off Kala Conti in Leopardstown Grade 3 in December; yard does well in this race
🔦 Spotlight: Only ninth to Dysart Enos in an Aintree Grade 2 bumper in her first spell with Henry de Bromhead but did well over hurdles back in France subsequently (third in French Champion Hurdle in May) and improved again returned to this yard when beating Kala Conti by 4l to win a Leopardstown Grade 3 (good to yielding) in December; interesting runner for a yard with a good recent record in this (they won it twice with Honeysuckle and also saddled the second, third and fourth last year).

🔦 Spotlight: Won her first six starts under rules (three bumpers and three novice hurdles); lost her unbeaten record but advanced her form again when third of 15 to Burdett Road in the Greatwood here (2m, good) on reappearance but a touch disappointing when only seventh in another valuable handicap hurdle at Ascot (2m, good to soft) just before Christmas; doesn't obviously shape as if crying out for a longer trip but has stamina in her pedigree and was second in a 3m point before embarking on her rules career.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart mare who should be sharper for reappearance but her yard has stronger contenders
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in the 2023 Triumph but only sixth to Lossiemouth in this last year; got a lot closer to her stablemate in a Punchestown Grade 1 in May but not at her best when third in 2m5f Warwick Listed race (soft) on reappearance 31 days ago; may come on for the outing but even a return to her peak form is unlikely to be enough.
