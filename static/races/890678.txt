🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rewarded strong support with a ready 6f win on handicap debut; big chance despite 6lb rise
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in three novice runs and he picked up really well to reward strong market support on his handicap debut at Southwell seven weeks ago (6f); 6lb higher in a stronger race but it may well not be enough to stop him.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "Every stride Backspin was learning there. Going past the line, he's pricked his ears when he hit the front, but he's done it good in the end. I made him get on and get the job done. I was happy - Finley Marsh, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Solid form when winning a 6f Kempton novice in January; only fifth on his handicap debut (C&D) but that was a strong race and he resumed winning ways at Southwell five weeks ago; 3lb rise manageable and he's not yet fully exposed.

🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each start, following his C&D win in January with a close second on his handicap debut at Kempton two weeks later (7f); left the impression a return to a well-run 6f would suit on that occasion and he remains capable of further progress; likely he'll need some luck from the inside stall but he's an intriguing contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No show in two runs for 🆕 new yard this year; change of headgear not enough to tempt
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent rather than 📈 progressive for Richard Hannon; ✂️ gelded prior to a low-key stable debut at Southwell in February; another modest effort last time (after a wind op); edging down the weights but comes here with plenty to prove; visor now tried (has worn cheekpieces the last twice).
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Newmarket (5f): "The Actor is a tough little horse and a real two-year-old. He's improved for that first run and I think he'll be better over further too. At this time of year you're trying to get a team together for Royal Ascot and he'd be in the mix for that. You have to keep a lid on him mentally, and Sean said he was a little bit naughty at the start, but he'll get better - Richard Hannon, trainer."
