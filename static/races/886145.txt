🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Haydock third (2m, soft; again from the front) came in a Grade 2; strong form claims
🔦 Spotlight: Twice second in bumpers on heavy ground; who won at Exeter (near 2m1f, soft) on his second hurdle start and his Haydock third (2m, soft; again from the front) came in a Grade 2, so he brings strong form claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Cut down a long odds-on favourite in four-runner and two-finisher event at Plumpton (soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Declined into a modest maiden on the Flat but it took only two attempts before he scored over hurdles; the form of that four-runner and two-finisher novice event at Plumpton (2m, soft; 25-1) 15 days ago is not easy to pin down but although he made up plenty of ground to cut down the long odds-on favourite, two of these rivals still seem to bring stronger credentials.

🔦 Spotlight: 374 days off and hooded first time when he won from off the pace in eight-runner maiden at Leicester (1m7f, heavy) three weeks ago, drawing 8l clear on the run-in, but that was after an almighty scare at the second last where he wandered badly once taking the lead and nearly got rid of his jockey; 🔥 big player assuming those issues can be ironed out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Cut down a long odds-on favourite in four-runner and two-finisher event at Plumpton (soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Declined into a modest maiden on the Flat but it took only two attempts before he scored over hurdles; the form of that four-runner and two-finisher novice event at Plumpton (2m, soft; 25-1) 15 days ago is not easy to pin down but although he made up plenty of ground to cut down the long odds-on favourite, two of these rivals still seem to bring stronger credentials.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Cut down a long odds-on favourite in four-runner and two-finisher event at Plumpton (soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Declined into a modest maiden on the Flat but it took only two attempts before he scored over hurdles; the form of that four-runner and two-finisher novice event at Plumpton (2m, soft; 25-1) 15 days ago is not easy to pin down but although he made up plenty of ground to cut down the long odds-on favourite, two of these rivals still seem to bring stronger credentials.

💬 Comment: Pulled up at Cheltenham; beaten 40l when 5th at Sandown (2m, soft; 100-1); now tongue tied
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up at Cheltenham (2m4f; 33-1) on New Year's Day and beaten 40l when fifth of ten at Sandown (2m, soft; 100-1) 18 days ago; tongue tied first time; probably best watched until he goes handicapping.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Cut down a long odds-on favourite in four-runner and two-finisher event at Plumpton (soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Declined into a modest maiden on the Flat but it took only two attempts before he scored over hurdles; the form of that four-runner and two-finisher novice event at Plumpton (2m, soft; 25-1) 15 days ago is not easy to pin down but although he made up plenty of ground to cut down the long odds-on favourite, two of these rivals still seem to bring stronger credentials.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won maiden at Leicester (1m7f, heavy) by 8l after an almighty scare at the second last
🔦 Spotlight: 374 days off and hooded first time when he won from off the pace in eight-runner maiden at Leicester (1m7f, heavy) three weeks ago, drawing 8l clear on the run-in, but that was after an almighty scare at the second last where he wandered badly once taking the lead and nearly got rid of his jockey; 🔥 big player assuming those issues can be ironed out.
