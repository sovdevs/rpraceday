🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy wins on both hurdle runs; much tougher task today but yard has done well in this race
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time German Flat winner (including on good to soft) who has posted easy wins on his two hurdle starts (2m3f/2m, good to firm/good); today is a much tougher test of his credentials but it remains to be seen where his limitations lie and his stable has won this with some classy sorts in the past.

💬 Comment: Had to work hard at Market Rasen but unbeaten over hurdles and 🚀 open to further improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper in late 2022 and returned from long absence to win twice over hurdles this winter (2m/2m2f, soft/good to soft); had to work hard at Market Rasen last time and this drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he came clear with a likeable prospect and is 🚀 open to further improvement.

💬 Comment: Only 4th when favourite in Gr1 Challow but that's unlikely to be the limit of his ability
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 in bumpers (good/good to soft) and won easily when odds-on for his hurdle debut at Newbury (2m, soft) in November; only fourth when 5-4 favourite for the Grade 1 Challow Novices' Hurdle at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in December and could do with settling better, but that form still reads well in today's company and is unlikely to be the limit of his ability.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy wins on both hurdle runs; much tougher task today but yard has done well in this race
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time German Flat winner (including on good to soft) who has posted easy wins on his two hurdle starts (2m3f/2m, good to firm/good); today is a much tougher test of his credentials but it remains to be seen where his limitations lie and his stable has won this with some classy sorts in the past.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper in late 2022 and returned from long absence to win twice over hurdles this winter (2m/2m2f, soft/good to soft); had to work hard at Market Rasen last time and this drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he came clear with a likeable prospect and is 🚀 open to further improvement.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had to work hard at Market Rasen but unbeaten over hurdles and 🚀 open to further improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper in late 2022 and returned from long absence to win twice over hurdles this winter (2m/2m2f, soft/good to soft); had to work hard at Market Rasen last time and this drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he came clear with a likeable prospect and is 🚀 open to further improvement.

💬 Comment: Only 4th when favourite in Gr1 Challow but that's unlikely to be the limit of his ability
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 in bumpers (good/good to soft) and won easily when odds-on for his hurdle debut at Newbury (2m, soft) in November; only fourth when 5-4 favourite for the Grade 1 Challow Novices' Hurdle at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in December and could do with settling better, but that form still reads well in today's company and is unlikely to be the limit of his ability.

🔦 Spotlight: Made it two wins in a row when scoring on handicap debut at Chepstow (2m, good to soft) in October and improved form in defeat the next twice, most recently third in 4yo Grade 3 at Fairyhouse (2m, yielding) in November; others may have greater potential but he might not be far away.

🔦 Spotlight: Four-time German Flat winner (including on good to soft) who has posted easy wins on his two hurdle starts (2m3f/2m, good to firm/good); today is a much tougher test of his credentials but it remains to be seen where his limitations lie and his stable has won this with some classy sorts in the past.
