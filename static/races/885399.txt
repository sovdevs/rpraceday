🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had to work hard at Market Rasen but unbeaten over hurdles and open to further improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper in late 2022 and returned from long absence to win twice over hurdles this winter (2m/2m2f, soft/good to soft); had to work hard at Market Rasen last time and this drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he came clear with a likeable prospect and is open to further improvement.

🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 in bumpers (good/good to soft) and won easily when odds-on for his hurdle debut at Newbury (2m, soft) in November; only fourth when 5-4 favourite for the Grade 1 Challow Novices' Hurdle at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in December and could do with settling better, but that form still reads well in today's company and is unlikely to be the limit of his ability.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had to work hard at Market Rasen but unbeaten over hurdles and open to further improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper in late 2022 and returned from long absence to win twice over hurdles this winter (2m/2m2f, soft/good to soft); had to work hard at Market Rasen last time and this drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he came clear with a likeable prospect and is open to further improvement.

💬 Comment: Only 4th when favourite in Gr1 Challow but that's unlikely to be the limit of his ability
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 in bumpers (good/good to soft) and won easily when odds-on for his hurdle debut at Newbury (2m, soft) in November; only fourth when 5-4 favourite for the Grade 1 Challow Novices' Hurdle at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in December and could do with settling better, but that form still reads well in today's company and is unlikely to be the limit of his ability.
