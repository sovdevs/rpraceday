🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Listed-winning hurdler; jumped right over C&D on chase debut; down in grade this time
🔦 Spotlight: She was useful in bumpers and over hurdles (Listed winner) but this season has been tough going, admittedly in better races than this; jumped to her right on chase debut over C&D in November; handles heavy ground and could well have more to come over fences.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jumped left (finished lame) when pulled up on chase debut; others look more convincing
🔦 Spotlight: Won three hurdle races at Uttoxeter last spring; perhaps needed her reappearance back at Uttoxeter last month but her chase debut at Leicester 13 days ago was disappointing, jumping to her left before being pulled up three out (found to be lame afterwards); improvement required on these terms.
