💬 Comment: C&D winner who was a fair sixth on last month's comeback and could build on that
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row last season (2m/1m7f, good to soft; including C&D) before two heavy defeats; returned from absence with fair sixth of eight on stable debut at Catterick (1m7f, soft) four weeks ago and could build on that.
