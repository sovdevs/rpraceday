🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Steadily 📈 progressive and it seems likely there's a fair bit more to come; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Perhaps the type that needs them coming back to him but there's also a strong suspicion he's going to be better than this mark when things do set up favourably; quickened smartly to win at Wolverhampton last month and a 5lb rise won't stop him if he's in the same form.
