🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Much improved over fences of late, tough task back from break but impressed latest; up 9lb
🔦 Spotlight: Benefited greatly from a break in the second half of 2024 and she ran a blinder from out of the weights against one who was way ahead of his mark over C&D (soft) in December; impressive winner from Orbys River at Market Rasen (2m1f, good to soft) since and a 9lb higher mark is not exorbitant; yard won this in 2022.

💬 Comment: Much improved over fences of late, tough task back from break but impressed latest; up 9lb
🔦 Spotlight: Benefited greatly from a break in the second half of 2024 and she ran a blinder from out of the weights against one who was way ahead of his mark over C&D (soft) in December; impressive winner from Orbys River at Market Rasen (2m1f, good to soft) since and a 9lb higher mark is not exorbitant; yard won this in 2022.

🔦 Spotlight: Benefited greatly from a break in the second half of 2024 and she ran a blinder from out of the weights against one who was way ahead of his mark over C&D (soft) in December; impressive winner from Orbys River at Market Rasen (2m1f, good to soft) since and a 9lb higher mark is not exorbitant; yard won this in 2022.

🔦 Spotlight: Benefited greatly from a break in the second half of 2024 and she ran a blinder from out of the weights against one who was way ahead of his mark over C&D (soft) in December; impressive winner from Orbys River at Market Rasen (2m1f, good to soft) since and a 9lb higher mark is not exorbitant; yard won this in 2022.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden; well treated on close 4th over C&D last January; well held back from break latest
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden who has run right up to his best in both runs at Leicester and is much lower in the weights than when close up over C&D (soft) last January; can go well fresh but he didn't at Market Rasen last month; revival still possible back here.
