🔦 Spotlight: Good third in first-time cheekpieces (retained since) at Huntingdon (3m1f, good to soft) on March 2 and won easily at Hereford (3m1f, good) six days later; hit with 11lb rise for last time but has strong claims if backing up that improved performance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Fakenham in January and went close at Plumpton last time; on the shortlist
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily at Fakenham (2m7f, good to soft) in January on second stable start and bounced back from lesser run there to go close at Plumpton (3m1f, soft) last month; every chance she'll be bang there once more.
