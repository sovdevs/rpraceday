🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sights lowered after Irish Gold Cup run, ground conditions will suit, sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Last season's King George winner; given a break after a fine Grade 1 second over hurdles at Auteuil last May; went close in a Grade 1 chase at Down Royal in November; below par effort in Grade 1 staying hurdle at Leopardstown in December (2 3/4l in front of Asterion Forlonge); sights lowered now after Irish Gold Cup run; improved ground conditions will suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Most recent of his seven wins came in a two-runner chase at Cork last March; fine effort subsequently when chasing home Teahupoo in Grade 1 Stayers' Hurdle at Punchestown; below his best in two high-class staying hurdles this season, though not beaten far in fifth in the Galmoy at Gowran.
