🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hosed up on hunter chase debut; has the most talent of these, as official ratings imply
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 9yo who enhanced his good strike-rate when returning from an absence to breeze clear for a wide-margin victory on his hunter chase debut at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy); he's a standout on official ratings and should be hard to beat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has always been talented; 3-4 in points before unseating early at Ffos Las
🔦 Spotlight: Formerly very smart, in bumpers and over hurdles and fences; still sprightly enough to win three of his four points before unseating at the first fence in Shearer's hunter chase at Ffos Las; did go off at only 100-30 (Shearer was 11-4) and he could make a race of it with the likely favourite.
