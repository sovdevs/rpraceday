🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 12 wins (five here); sign of revival over C&D last time; 🔥 big player in first-time headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Has been an excellent stable servant over the years, winning 12 races, five of them here; seemed rusty on his first two outings this year but showed much more when second of eight over C&D (good) last Sunday; now wears headgear for the first time; 🔥 big player from an unchanged mark.
Horse quote: 2023-09-23 at Ayr (6f): "It's fantastic, Gweedore jumped and travelled well, everything went great, I think he was just beaten by two better handicapped horses at the end of the day. It's just fantastic to have a horse here in the Gold Cup. He's been an amazing horse for his owners, they're Scottish too, so to even have a runner in the race is very special. The options are a bit dry on the ground over seven furlongs for him, so we'll probably look at something again over six - Katie Scott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Proved a model of consistency in 2024, unplaced just once from seven attempts, winning over this trip at Ffos Las and Carlisle and runner-up over C&D on final start; likeable type, but she'll need another personal best to make a winning reappearance after more than six months off.

💬 Comment: Upwardly mobile 4yo; began new campaign with promising C&D third; seems sure to go well
🔦 Spotlight: Upwardly mobile 4yo who ended last season with a Scottish hat-trick and began the new campaign with a promising third over this C&D (good ground); that last effort ties him in closely with second-placed Gweedore who runs for the same owners; remains 🔍 unexposed and seems sure to go well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-7; another surge of improvement to win Ayr Bronze Cup; big danger if ready after absence
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo with three successes from just seven starts; won a competitive 7f event at York last spring and showed another surge of improvement to beat his 23 rivals in the Ayr Bronze Cup (6f, good) in September, staying on strongly from midfield; open to further progress and he'll be a danger to all if ready to roll again after seven months off.
Horse quote: 2024-09-20 at Ayr (6f): "They went a nice gallop throughout, we got cover and at the three-pole I was looking around thinking 'I'm going well here.' I kept it simple, pulled Diligent Resdev out and he steamed home. He's a very quick horse with a high cruising rate and he powered through the line - Lewis Chalkey, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Well held three times since a decisive Haydock success (7f, good to soft) last September, and as a result he's back to that winning mark; however, he'll need to step up significantly from his reappearance form when last of seven at Southwell; stable won this race in 2023.
