🔦 Spotlight: On the downgrade but retains sufficient ability to compete at this level; weak in the market and found nothing off the bridle at Kempton last time; return to this track might help but the losing run is gathering momentum.
Horse quote: 2023-02-04 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "Harry Brown is a 5f horse really but gets 6f around here. He did that well as he had a lot of weight and will be an interesting horse on the grass - Hayley Turner, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Well backed when winning over C&D in December; hasn't matched that form in three 5f runs since but she's back to that winning mark again and has a good draw for a front-runner; betting useful.
Horse quote: 2024-04-10 at Lingfield (AW) (5f): "Last time it was six, but we know Unavailable has the speed for five and the cheekpieces obviously worked. She's run a huge race. The second has done as well - it's a shame they had to run in the same race. She just needs a bit of guidance and the cheekpieces do the job - Chelsea Banham, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won a Class 5 off this mark in January; has a point to prove after three poor runs though
🔦 Spotlight: On the same mark as when winning a Class 5 at Wolverhampton in January; effective on Polytrack but he comes here with a point to prove after three disappointing runs.
Horse quote: 2022-04-26 at Yarmouth (6f): "Prince Of Bel Lir enjoyed this ground better than he did at Thirsk last time and hopefully he can build on this - Daniel Muscutt, rider."
