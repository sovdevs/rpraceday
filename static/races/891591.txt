🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very close third off this mark at Catterick last time and could be bang there once more
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Newcastle (5f, AW) in February when back from wind surgery and he was a very close third off this mark at Catterick (5f, good) three weeks ago; could be bang there once more.
Horse quote: 2019-07-21 at Curragh (6f): "Latin Five is a horse we thought might win his maiden, but this was the first time he really raced professionally. He loved the stiff six and should go the seven at some stage. We'll see what the handicapper does - Joseph O'Brien, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Has a regressive profile but he was suited by the drop back to 5f when fourth of seven at Nottingham (5f, good) recently in first-time cheekpieces; continues to drop down the weights and he could be in the mix; the cheekpieces are left off and a hood returns.

🔦 Spotlight: Three-time turf winner who scored at Newcastle (5f, AW) in February on his third run back from a long absence; merely mid-division the next twice but it was a higher grade at Musselburgh last time and he's not ruled out.

🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who is without a win since October 2023; however, he was a fair fifth over 6f here ten days ago in a first-time visor and this drop back to 5f could be a plus; each-way possibilities in reapplied blinkers.
Horse quote: 2023-10-20 at Redcar (5f): "John Kirkup was due a win as he's been unlucky all season. He got his ground and he always shows his best - David Thompson, trainer."
