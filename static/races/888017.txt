🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Could easily land the four-timer if okay back sprinting and not missing usual tongue-tie
🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 at three but his agonizing defeat on Boxing Day was a sign of things to come; 3-3 this year, winning over 7f at Wolverhampton (twice) and here (once); the runner-up got first run on him last time but he readily bridged the gap; 🔥 big player off 5lb higher if okay back sprinting and not missing usual tongue-tie.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Doubt we've seen the best of him in handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: Entered handicaps off what looked a fair mark but a ripple rather than a splash has been made (for James Tate first time); wasn't seen to best effect last time, this is easier and he has time on his side.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: January is his favourite month and last-time-out third can be marked up
🔦 Spotlight: Again hit form over 7f at Wolverhampton in January, this time winning twice; left poorly placed and was denied a clear run when sprinting for the first time at his favourite venue 16 days ago, managing third but possibly deserving more; can go well again if this pans out better; non-runner due to travel problems at Wolverhampton yesterday.

🔦 Spotlight: Good record of 10-44; two C&D wins this time last year and is now 6lb lower than for the second of them; found just the other joint-favourite too strong over 7f here 13 days ago; 🔥 big player, especially if cheekpieces have the desired effect (has never worn headgear).

🔦 Spotlight: This Irish raider lost 22 races before winning back-to-back 5f contests last summer (dead-heat second time); good second the only time Rossa Ryan has had the leg up; just a fair run last week and returning to 6f can't be deemed a positive.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Could easily land the four-timer if okay back sprinting and not missing usual tongue-tie
🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 at three but his agonizing defeat on Boxing Day was a sign of things to come; 3-3 this year, winning over 7f at Wolverhampton (twice) and here (once); the runner-up got first run on him last time but he readily bridged the gap; 🔥 big player off 5lb higher if okay back sprinting and not missing usual tongue-tie.

💬 Comment: Has really lost his way and can't support until showing signs of a revival
🔦 Spotlight: AW wins six, seven (here) and eight (here) came last March; has really lost his way and was a bitterly disappointing 5-4 favourite at Newcastle last week; can't support until showing signs of a revival.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has really lost his way and can't support until showing signs of a revival
🔦 Spotlight: AW wins six, seven (here) and eight (here) came last March; has really lost his way and was a bitterly disappointing 5-4 favourite at Newcastle last week; can't support until showing signs of a revival.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Could easily land the four-timer if okay back sprinting and not missing usual tongue-tie
🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 at three but his agonizing defeat on Boxing Day was a sign of things to come; 3-3 this year, winning over 7f at Wolverhampton (twice) and here (once); the runner-up got first run on him last time but he readily bridged the gap; 🔥 big player off 5lb higher if okay back sprinting and not missing usual tongue-tie.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: January is his favourite month and last-time-out third can be marked up
🔦 Spotlight: Again hit form over 7f at Wolverhampton in January, this time winning twice; left poorly placed and was denied a clear run when sprinting for the first time at his favourite venue 16 days ago, managing third but possibly deserving more; can go well again if this pans out better; non-runner due to travel problems at Wolverhampton yesterday.

💬 Comment: Just one real run of note since breakthrough win; no headgear back sprinting
🔦 Spotlight: Found a weak novice in which to open her account at the 13th time of asking in; just one real run of note since and not sure this return to sprinting is the answer; goes without cheekpieces.
