🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won three of last four; best right-handed, on a roll and has major chance again
🔦 Spotlight: On a roll at present and he made it three successes from his last four outings when scoring in workmanlike style at Ludlow (2m, good) last month; tends to jump right and all his wins have come this way round; major chance again.
Horse quote: 2020-01-23 at Gowran Park (16f): "He's a big weak horse and maybe one for next year - Gordon Elliott, trainer of Homme D'Un Soir."

💬 Comment: Four wins in autumn and impossible to discount after five-month absence
🔦 Spotlight: Had an excellent autumn, winning four times (two hurdles, two chases) at Sedgefield, and soft ground was possibly against him when he was only fourth of nine there last time; will need a personal best to get back on the winning trail after a five-month absence but he's impossible to discount.

🔦 Spotlight: Can compete off the same mark as when winning over C&D (good to soft) in October, but that's because he's been disappointing since; beaten a long way out at Newcastle two weeks ago and difficult to recommend.

🔦 Spotlight: Doesn't look the force of old and a losing sequence stretches back more than two years; tailed off when switched back to hurdles at Bangor in December; needs to be revived by a break.
Horse quote: 2023-03-22 at Haydock (16.5f): "Grey Diamond was brilliant early and the pace kind of died. He's got an incredibly high cruising speed and it's about channelling his energy the right way. He likes soft ground - Sam Twiston-Davies, rider."
