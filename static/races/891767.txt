🔦 Spotlight: Did not fire when among the market principals at the Festival here in March and found one just too good when odds-on for small-field point last month but has won at this meeting for the last two years (3m1f/3m2f) and has strong claims if back on song in first-time cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointed on hunter chase debut last spring but is 3-4 in points since returning from a break in December; the form of his latest win has been well advertised by the runner-up since, and he'll be suited by the forecast good ground here; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has rediscovered some form in points this year; tried in blinkers on rules return
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful hurdler in his prime and has rediscovered some forms in points for new stable this year, most recently when winning in refitted cheekpieces at Didmarton (good to soft) in March; tried in first-time blinkers here; needs to prove he can still cut the mustard under rules.
Horse quote: 2022-03-17 at Cheltenham (24f): "The best horse won on the day, so we'll take our defeat. We couldn't ask any more of Paddy (Brennan) or Alaphilippe, both of them left nothing out there. You could run that race ten times and you'd get five apiece. I thought he'd win from jumping the back of the last so I'm pretty gutted at the minute but the lads have been so supportive and this has been the plan for some time. It nearly came off - Fergal O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Left disappointing stable debut behind when second at Leicester in February; more needed
🔦 Spotlight: Formerly useful in Ireland for Henry de Bromhead; left disappointing stable debut behind when second (no match for winner) at Leicester (2m6f, soft) in February but probably needs to take another step forward here.
Horse quote: 2019-03-07 at Thurles (22.5f): "He is a gorgeous horse. We bought him before Christmas. He seems a lovely young horse and won his point to point in Ballindenisk. He had worked nicely since we got him and I'm delighted he went and did that. He is a real chaser in the making and will have a couple of more runs over hurdles now and will hopefully go chasing next year. There is a 2m and a 2m4f novice hurdle at Fairyhouse but there's a 3m novice handicap there on March 22n or else he could go for one of the staying novice hurdles at Punchestown as I'd say he's a real staying type of fellow - Henry De Bromhead, trainer"

💬 Comment: Won at Stratford on last year's hunter chase debut; may have more to offer under rules
🔦 Spotlight: Made winning hunter chase debut at Stratford (2m6f, good) last spring and returned from break with 3m4f open point win in January; beaten in a match race since but could still have a bit more to offer under rules.
