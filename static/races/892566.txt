🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Locally trained, 0-9 over hurdles, promise at Wexford in August, can't discount
🔦 Spotlight: Locally trained maiden is 0-9 over hurdles; shaped well on stable debut when a 3.75l second of 13 at Wexford (20.5f, good to yielding) last August and races off the same mark here; runs since not as encouraging but may have needed latest after a three-month break; can't discount.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flat winner, 2-25 over hurdles, has lost form, well-handicapped but hard to fancy
🔦 Spotlight: Two-time Flat winner is 2-25 over hurdles; last win came for Nigel Slevin in a Down Royal handicap chase last April; has been out of form since joining Cian Collins; well-handicapped on old form but he's hard to fancy on recent showings.
Horse quote: 2020-09-21 at Listowel (16f): "Politicise ran a cracker in Galway in a novice hurdle and his big asset is his jumping as he is very accurate and Darragh gave him the most wonderful ride. He is a lovely dual purpose horse and we will give him a break during the winter and go back novice chasing next year. We'll look for a flat pot with him next - Stephen Thorne, assistant trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise in Naas maiden in December, poor twice since, local yard, watch unless backed
🔦 Spotlight: Locally trained; 0-5 over hurdles; best maiden effort a 23l seventh of 18 at Naas; struggled on handicap debut but heavy ground probably wasn't ideal; no impact back in a maiden at Thurles latest; best watched unless the market speaks in his favour.
