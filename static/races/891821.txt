🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Thriving this spring but he's gone up 20lb for his three wins; needs another personal best
🔦 Spotlight: He has returned from nine months off in rude health, second at Newcastle last month before winning twice over C&D and completing his hat-trick at Lingfield on Good Friday; now 20lb higher than for the first win and he'll need to reach new heights to make it a four-timer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improving sprinter; ran on strongly to score on recent return to action (5f); C&D winner
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner; ended 2024 in good form and he made an impressive seasonal debut when powering home at Beverley 11 days ago (5f, good); up 4lb but may not have reached his ceiling just yet.
Horse quote: 2024-09-08 at York (6f): "Northern Spirit is the second horse I've bred - the first one wasn't too great. He was in great form and we knew he'd like the ground, but I was concerned about the draw - Brian Ellison, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔥 big player on last year's best form; sharper for last month's return; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: Classy operator on his day and he is only 2lb higher than when winning last year's Gosforth Park Cup (5f, Tapeta); equally effective at 6f, as when doing best of the low numbers in the Ayr Silver Cup; not at his best at Newcastle last month but perhaps sharper today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big chance on last year's Kempton wins; latest turf run easy to excuse; headgear switch
🔦 Spotlight: Beat notable opponents when winning twice at Kempton last year; defeats on turf since aren't the races to judge him on and he still has a bigger effort in him on AW; usual cheekpieces replaced by new blinkers today.
Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Kempton (AW) (6f): "Drama was a little bit disappointing on his last run and, as Tom Marquand said, he just felt as if he'd had a couple of runs in quick succession and lacked that kick. Either way, this was the obvious choice having won here before and the team at home have done a great job freshening him up. This was a great opportunity but I'd love to get him on a bit of soft ground now. He's run plenty of good races on the turf and I think he's pretty versatile - James Ferguson, trainer."

💬 Comment: Fluffed his lines when well backed on recent Ripon return; still 🔍 unexposed; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo; won off this mark on his seasonal return last summer; notably strong in the market ahead of his return to action at Ripon ten days ago but failed to fire; too soon to write him off.
Horse quote: 2023-10-20 at Redcar (6f): "Valentine Catcher showed enough at home but first-time-out in those conditions, you'd think it wouldn't be ideal. He was a bit slow away and a bit green but he travelled nicely and got there quite easily. There's obviously plenty of potential there and I was quite impressed - David Allan, jockey."

💬 Comment: On the downgrade but retains sufficient ability to play a part at this level
🔦 Spotlight: Finished in front of a couple of today's rivals when second over C&D last month but he's not featured in either run since; Rossa Ryan tries his luck this evening but more minor money perhaps his best hope.
Horse quote: 2023-10-06 at Ascot (6f): "It's great to get Rohaan back. I was under a bit of pressure today because I told his owners he was on his way back and they've come over from Ireland, so it's great. He's a horse of a lifetime for me and he'll come back here for the Group 1 on Champions Day. He finished fourth last year so we might as well have a go - David Evans, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form has taken off in recent starts; return to 6f could prompt another step forward
🔦 Spotlight: Better than ever when dropped to 6f in the autumn, winning at Chelmsford in good style and then pipped close home over C&D; as good as ever when winning a 7f handicap here on his return from a four-month break last week; 2lb higher mark to deal with but may yet do better at 6f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Conditions to suit; unlucky in running here last month; ignore latest run; major player
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in January and ran to a similar level over 5f at Newcastle next time; heavily backed and was making inroads when badly hampered over C&D last month; Newcastle run on Good Friday easy enough to excuse; of serious interest back down in class under these conditions but his yard aren't in quite the same form as they were.
Horse quote: 2023-06-03 at Epsom (6f): "We were thinking Badri was just an all-weather horse. We ran him at Beverley as we thought a stiff five would suit. He romped home and he wasn't disgraced at York. It didn't look like he was coming down the hill but he was doing his best work where it mattered most. We tried him on the grass last year and he didn't really look like he suited it but my horses are running much better this year and that is sometimes how it goes. We were thinking about the Gosforth Park Cup as he's unbeaten over five furlongs at Newcastle, and there's also a big five-furlong handicap at Ascot in July - we had that in mind thinking that a stiff five at Ascot would suit him - Ruth Carr, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Of interest on her useful turf form and her reappearance was fine; down in grade here
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who ended 2024 in fine form, winning Class 2 handicaps at Newmarket and Pontefract (both 6f, soft) before a good fourth at Doncaster in November (Listed); shaped encouragingly at Doncaster on her return four weeks ago, weakening when hampered inside the final furlong; has won on Tapeta but she needs to produce a big personal best on AW to win.
Horse quote: 2024-09-26 at Newmarket (6f): "Grant Tuer said Sophia's Starlight was in form coming here today and she loves that bit of juice in the ground. I don't think she's the easiest filly to keep right at home but she's had a bit of a freshen up and was tough today - Sam James, jockey."

💬 Comment: Conditions to suit but suspicion he'll prove vulnerable in this grade
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins this winter, two of them over C&D, but he is still 2lb higher than for the last of them and this grade looks too taxing.
Horse quote: 2025-01-24 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "Many A Star did it well. With a horse of his age, especially at this sort of distance, when they're in good form it's best to keep rolling. He's a big horse and is taking his racing well. This track does really suit him as it gives him a long time to wind up. They went a strong gallop and he picked up a bit quicker than I thought he would, we were in front plenty long enough, but he's very game and it's a credit to Jamie [Osborne, trainer] and the team for keeping him in such good form - William Carver, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten three times since Lingfield win in February; work to do with Westmorian on latest
🔦 Spotlight: Ready winner of a 6f handicap at Lingfield in February; beaten three times since and he was no match for Westmorian at Lingfield nine days ago, even allowing for the fact that being on the rail probably wasn't ideal; others look stronger.
Horse quote: 2022-09-16 at Ayr (5f): "The doubt was there because Prince Of Pillo had run the other day and we were backing him up quite quick. But if he hadn't been bumped at Doncaster he'd have been a comfortable third behind two very good two-year-olds. He's got so much natural pace and he's got a lovely relaxed attitude as well. I'd say he's a good one - Keith Dalgleish, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good course record; won over 6f last summer but probably vulnerable after a layoff
🔦 Spotlight: Good record at this track for former stables; best known as a trailblazer over 5f but he came from off the pace to win a 6f handicap at Chester last summer, his first win at the trip; he'll need to be at that level back after six months off if he is to make a winning start for new trainer.
