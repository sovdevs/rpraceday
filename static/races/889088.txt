🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Eight course wins, second on latest, stable in form, excellent chance at these weights
🔦 Spotlight: Has 15 AW wins to his name, including eight at this venue but none since October 2023; did well to get within 3/4l of Valiant Force over 5f here in October and again took second behind that useful sort over this trip three weeks ago; stable 6-24 here this year; excellent chance at these weights.
