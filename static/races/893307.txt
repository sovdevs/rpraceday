🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two good runs in defeat over hurdles during winter; solid 7f return and this trip can suit
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 7f maiden on debut last year but was below that level after on the Flat; put up two good runs in defeat over hurdles during winter; produced a solid 7f return effort at Naas when nearest at the finish and this step-up in trip can suit.
Horse quote: 2024-03-18 at Curragh (7f): "Money Dancer behaved herself better here than she does at home, she's very bouncy and not simple. But she has always shown us plenty. She has been tipping along all winter but we liked the couple of pieces of work she did. She found plenty and handled the trip well. We will roll the dice a bit with her now. With those fillies, you are as well off to get what you can when you can with them, so we will go for a Listed race somewhere - Noel Meade, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a valuable Goodwood h'cap last year but not as good since off this mark; needs more
🔦 Spotlight: Won a valuable Goodwood handicap last year over 1m2f, his third win; not as good since off this mark; found 1m too sharp on return in Irish Lincoln; this trip suits better but needs more.
Horse quote: 2024-07-30 at Goodwood (10f): "Take Heart has been training very well. Going to York, I thought he had a big chance but he was drawn on the outside which made things difficult. So, when he was drawn 18 today, I thought 'What did I do wrong to get these bad draws?'. He was only beaten by four and a half lengths at York and he had a lot of ground to make up in the straight, so Ben [Coen, jockey] said he would be a little closer today. They went so slow that he was controlling the race at all times. This trip is probably ideal. I haven't spoke to Barry [Irwin, founding member] and Team Valor yet, but there's the big handicap on Irish Champions Weekend that he ran very well in last year so he could go there. He's probably a Stakes horse and he might make it up to there one day - Johnny Murtagh, trainer."

💬 Comment: Group 3 winner in 2023 but not as good last year; questions on return; best on good ground
🔦 Spotlight: Group 3 winner in 2023 but not as good last year; dropped to a reasonable mark but questions remain on return; best on good ground.
Horse quote: 2023-07-01 at Curragh (10f): "You'd have to say Mashhoor has improved immensely. He's been very straightforward this year. There was no pace today so I said to Ben (Coen) to just let him roll along as he leads the string at home. I knew when they turned in that they weren't going to get to him, as he wasn't going to stop because he won over a mile and a half last time - Johnny Murtagh, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: By far his best run was when narrowly beaten in a Navan maiden last year over 1m2f; well below that form twice after and questions on return from 1lb out of the handicap.

🔦 Spotlight: First reserve; three-time winner last year on a sound surface, rising 14lb in the weights; is 3lb out of the handicap on return so a tough task.
Horse quote: 2024-08-08 at Leopardstown (9f): "Killeaney Bear didn't handle the track or the ground at Galway, but he pulled out of the race well and we chanced it. He's a big, raw horse and I would say there is more to come, especially next year - Andy Slattery, trainer."
