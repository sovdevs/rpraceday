🔦 Spotlight: Decent level of form at two when second in maidens at Listowel and Curragh and better form on seasonal return early this month over C&D, not quite getting home after racing keenly when caught for second late on by today's rival Vorfreude; will need to settle better but 🔥 big player.

🔦 Spotlight: Fastnet Rock filly whose unraced dam is sister to winners Yucatan (Australian 1m4f Group 2), Faufiler (US 9.5f Grade 3) and Mount Everest (1m2f Listed), and half-sister to 5f Group 2 winner Planet Five, family of Breeders' Cup Mile winner Six Perfections; caught the eye on last month's Curragh debut over this trip, staying on strongly to finish third after racing green; quite likely she could improve enough to play a leading role.
