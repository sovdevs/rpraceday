📝 Comment: in rear, steady headway over 1f out, ran green inside final furlong, pressed winner final strides, just held (inquiry held into running and riding of colt, which was 🔄 held up 🔄 towards rear of field before being asked for an effort entering straight, where after colt ran on very strongly inside final furlong to finish 2nd, beaten a neck; jockey stated that his instructions were to ride colt to finish the race strongly; he reported that colt had experienced a number of problems in training at home, explaining the 222 day absence from the racecourse between this run and his first at thirsk; he continued that pace of race was very strong in early stages, and that colt had raced greenly around the bend, lugging out due to his inexperience; having turned in, jockey reported that his focus was on keeping colt running straight and true, and that having used the whip in backhand position on one occasion, this resulted in colt shifting left-handed, explaining why he returned to riding hands and heels through to the line, by doing so keeping colt balanced; his explanation was noted)
