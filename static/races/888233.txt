🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrow pick on hurdling RPRs, but does need to settle and jump better to progress.
🔦 Spotlight: RPRs for both hurdling thirds (one C&D) narrowly set the standard here, and are worth upgrading considering the refusal to settle in one and mistakes in both; drier ground than for either likely awaits.

💬 Comment: No stamina issues; could have lots more to offer over hurdles if only settling better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1m3f-1m6f Flat winner, but hasn't seen out a sharp 2m on either previous hurdling start.
🔦 Spotlight: Has outrun his mark on both recent Flat runs since a big absence; as a winner in that sphere at up to 1m6f his failure to stay a sharp 2m on either previous hurdles run was disappointing; something to prove.

🔦 Spotlight: Showed more in the second of two Taunton events in February, albeit still beaten 22l in a race run at a slow time (2m1f, good to soft); hopes pinned on the likely sounder surface (8.5f-1m2f Flat winner on such).
