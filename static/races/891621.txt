🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very smart; winner of Group/Graded races in Britain, USA and UAE; leading contender
🔦 Spotlight: Very smart performer who has seen a lot of the world; dual Group 3 scorer in Britain as a 2yo and completed a US Grade 2 hat-trick last season; justified favouritism in UAE Group 2 in sole run this year; leading contender in this first British start for two years.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Meydan (12f): "Flavien [Pratt, jockey] rode Silver Knott most of the time in America last year and won with him from the front. Looking at the race beforehand, you sensed there was a lack of pace so he was a logical leader and I was quite impressed with what he did. He's a real uncomplicated, solid horse who always turns up. The key to him - as with most horses - is getting him in a rhythm and he was faultless. He deserves to take his chance in the Sheema Classic, but Rebel's Romance is the heavyweight champion and a legend - William Buick, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in the 2024 Derby; 🔥 big player if back to that form; second run for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Faded into fourth in the Earl Of Sefton here on stable/seasonal debut, running below par for the third start in succession; impressive in the Lingfield trial then ran well, beating all bar City Of Troy, in last year's Derby; 🔥 big player provided he's back to that very smart form.
Horse quote: 2024-06-30 at Curragh (12f): "Ambiente Friendly travelled really well to the two pole and just got outstayed in the last furlong. The winner and the second are both very good horses. I still think we'll probably be dropping back in trip next time - James Fanshawe, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Capable of very useful form but chance depends on how well he responds to the headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Finished about 10l behind Ambiente Friendly in the 2024 Derby and 7l behind Divina Grace at Newbury on reappearance; showed very useful form in between those defeats but his chance of landing this prize depends on how well he responds to first-time headgear.
Horse quote: 2024-08-31 at Kentucky Downs (10.5f): "Bellum Justum absolutely flubbed the start. I was way too far back, but lucky Jamie [Spencer, on pacesetting Navy Seal] was so fast. On the back straight, I was able to make good improvement to get a slot, because I knew he would stay very well. I knew he'd gallop out to the line because he stays a mile and a half - Frankie Dettori, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful for Rae Guest; took her form to a new level with a game success in Newbury Group 3 on stable/seasonal debut, taking record to 6-21; faces a stiffer task in this grade but may rate higher still and she's the sole C&D winner in the field; very hard to dismiss.
Horse quote: 2025-04-12 at Newbury (12f): "Rae [Guest, former trainer] had helped us with the way Divina Grace wants to be ridden and it certainly seemed to suit her well. - Andrew Balding, trainer."
