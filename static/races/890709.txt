🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in both starts, over C&D on debut and behind a hotpot latest; solid contender
🔦 Spotlight: Bred for at least 1m2f but she's shown promise in two runs this year, second over C&D on debut before chasing home a long odds-on favourite at Lingfield last week (1m); this looks weaker and she's high on the list.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising 2nd from poor position on Kempton debut (7f); mixed messages for 1m on breeding
🔦 Spotlight: It almost certainly wasn't a strong Kempton maiden in which he finished second on last month's debut (7f) but it was a promising start given he came from well back in a race that was steadily run to halfway; ran the final 2f quicker than anything else in the race, suggesting he wasn't short of speed, and stepping up to a mile isn't sure to suit on pedigree; open to improvement though and commands respect.

🔦 Spotlight: Too green to do herself justice on last month's Chelmsford debut (1m) and although the penny was dropping late on, she's likely to need more time and distance.
