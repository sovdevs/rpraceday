🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Listed winner at 1m4f; has the highest rating of these but there are improvers lurking
🔦 Spotlight: Had the 15 races now so fairly exposed but she won at this level on her penultimate appearance (1m4f, good to firm), adding to her reappearance success last May; has the highest rating of these but there are improvers lurking.
Horse quote: 2024-08-22 at York (12f): "This set up pretty well for Scenic. Oisin gave her a peach of a ride and she's just outstayed her rivals. It all fell into place today. Oisin rode her in this last year and he was really cross with himself afterwards. He said in the paddock he gave her a bad ride last year, but kept it really smooth today. She definitely wants a bit of ease in the ground. The Park Hill is an obvious shout and maybe the Prix Royal-Oak, as she probably won't stay in training next year - Ed Walker, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never better than when stepped up to 1m4f last season; more needed but that's feasible
🔦 Spotlight: Did well at 1m2f last season but her form spiked in a big way when stepped up to 1m4f for a Newmarket handicap (good to soft; won on good firm) that she won going away; that form won't be good enough here but she's a late-maturing filly with plenty more to offer no doubt.
Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Newmarket (12f): "Chorus improved for this trip and I believe she'll stay in training to get some black type -  William Haggas, trainer."

💬 Comment: Southwell maiden winner and then well held in a French Listed; has enough to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Outclassed two rivals when odds-on for a 1m maiden at Southwell in October and then contested a Listed race at Saint-Cloud, where she was fitted with a sheepskin noseband and carried her head a shade high in finishing a 10l fourth; has more to prove than a few of these but she's in top hands.

💬 Comment: Only won a minor maiden but she's 🔍 unexposed and cost 400,000gns as a yearling
🔦 Spotlight: Wins nothing here on the form of her defeat of three rivals at Wolverhampton (1m4f) in November but she cost 400,000gns as a yearling and there should be better days ahead of her; stable second string on jockey bookings.

🔦 Spotlight: Rapid headway through the handicap ranks last year after fitted with cheekpieces, completing a hat-trick at about 1m4f on varying ground; held her own at Listed level on final reappearance with a front-running second at Ascot (1m6f); just the type to make a better 4yo and she's had wind surgery.

💬 Comment: 0-8 since debut win but signed off last season good runs in a Group 3 and two Listed races
🔦 Spotlight: Has gone 0-8 since her winning debut but she wasn't far away in her final three races of last season, a German Group 3 (1m, good to soft) and Listed races at Yarmouth (1m2f, good to firm) and Longchamp (1m1f, heavy); races prominently and unlikely to be far away.
Horse quote: 2023-10-20 at Redcar (8f): "Molten Rock is a very nice filly. She works well at home and loved the ground today. It was a moderate race but she'll come on a lot for it - Clifford Lee, jockey."

💬 Comment: 2-4 for William Haggas, the defeats at Listed level; changed hands for 280,000gns
🔦 Spotlight: Impeccably bred filly who won in maiden (1m2f) and novice company (1m4f) for William Haggas but offered little in two Listed assignments (1/2f; 15-2); has time on her side to put that right and she fetched 280,000gns at the sales in December; would like to see some confidence in the market on this occasion.
Horse quote: 2024-05-03 at Newmarket (10f): "That was nice. I thought Sea Just In Time did that well. We always thought she was nice and is well-rated, being a sister to Truthful and we had the older sister as well (Sea On Time) who sadly injured a tendon after winning a maiden when she looked nice. There is no rush to decide where she goes next, I'll leave that to William. I think she probably needs three weeks before she runs again and we could look for a Listed contest for her. There are lots of things later in the year like the Irish Oaks. Sea Of Class was second here before going on to win a Listed race and then on to win the Irish Oaks - Maureen Haggas, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: She's useful and 1m4f seems her trip, but will need a career best to take this
🔦 Spotlight: Ran some good races on soft turf at about 1m4f last year, including a third at Listed level and a handicap second here; perhaps didn't fancy the AW on final appearance; she's useful but will need a career best to take this.
Horse quote: 2024-04-26 at Doncaster (10f): "That was a good performance, Our Golden One loves the ground. The way she relaxed and quickened away gives her possible options over further - Hollie Doyle, jockey."
