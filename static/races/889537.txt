🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Started slowly in all three handicaps but was placed over 6f the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo; blew start on handicap debut and again slowly away before keeping on well to be placed on next two 6f starts; comes with obvious risks but this return to 7f ought to suit and he can be very dangerous off his current mark if he gets away from the stalls reasonably well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well on second of two stable starts but is 0-15 overall; not the percentage call
🔦 Spotlight: 15-race maiden; bettered disappointing stable debut when second at Southwell (7f) in January but raced too freely and was below that form there 16 days ago; not the percentage call.
