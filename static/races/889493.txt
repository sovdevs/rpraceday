💬 Comment: Ran big race in defeat when back over fences last month; 2lb rise looks manageable
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in 2023; out of form over hurdles this season but ran big race in defeat when back over fences at Exeter (3m, good) last month; can handle a 2lb rise if in the right mood again.

🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in 2023; out of form over hurdles this season but ran big race in defeat when back over fences at Exeter (3m, good) last month; can handle a 2lb rise if in the right mood again.
