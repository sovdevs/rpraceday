üî¶ Spotlight: Carries his head rather high; started his career with two seconds at this track early last year; ran away with a maiden at Windsor in July and good third on handicap debut at Yarmouth in August, both 1m2f; half-brother to high-class Giavellotto and, after just four races, surely has potential.

üî¶ Spotlight: 1m4f win here on handicap debut in May 2023; that was his last AW race and he was smart at his best afterwards on turf, but ended last term with two poor runs; sold out of Sir Michael Stoute's for 30,000gns in October and he does have a good first-time-out record.
