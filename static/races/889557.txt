🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two wins here during the winter and he looks worth a try at this new trip; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Had a productive time on Polytrack during the winter including two wins at this track (1m2f); his last success was by a nose last month but he's only 2lb higher here and has shaped as though this new trip should be within range; key player with Simon Walker booked.

💬 Comment: Came good with 4l win at Bath (2m) in October; respected back in trip on her return
🔦 Spotlight: Seems effective with and without a hood; no win in first 11 runs but, after wind surgery, she came good with a 4l success under David Dunsdon at Bath (2m1f, soft) in October; this is a big drop back in trip but she's only 3lb higher than last time and was runner-up over 1m4f in the autumn; respected on return.

🔦 Spotlight: Still a maiden after 15 starts but he's been placed in five of his last six runs including when a 2l third over C&D (classified event) on Monday; usually comes from off the pace and could be a big factor back in a handicap.

🔦 Spotlight: Made his breakthrough at Chelmsford (1m2f) in December and has had a couple of near misses since but he didn't fire with cheekpieces added at Newcastle last time; bit to prove again after that and he's struggled in three previous runs at this trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Missed last year and was out the back at Southwell on recent comeback; others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: Triple winner (including over C&D) but he missed last year and was out the back at Southwell (1m) on recent comeback for 🆕 new yard; this big step back up in trip looks a good move but he's in the veteran stage now and needs to leave that latest form well behind; visor added.
