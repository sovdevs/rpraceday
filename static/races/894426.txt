💬 Comment: Placed in 2 points before £135,000 sale; 2nd in Thurles bumper; should appreciate further
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two points before £135,000 sale and pulled a little way clear with the winner when runner-up in a Thurles bumper in March; winner from that race didn't enhance the form at Aintree but two in behind have won since; should appreciate the step up in trip and Swan probably had the choice of Elliott's pair.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd in a point and 2nd in 2 British bumpers; not strong form but new trip may help
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a point and has hit the crossbar in two British bumpers so far; that form is unlikely to be strong enough but new trip may help given that there is stamina on the dam's side of his pedigree.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Awtaad mare; unraced dam closely related to Flat winner Star Seeking; sole newcomer; tough
🔦 Spotlight: Awtaad mare; unraced dam closely related to 7f/1m winner Star Seeking, out of 1m winning half-sister to 9.4f/1m2f Listed winner Livadiya and useful 1m2f-1m4f winner Lidakiya (dam of 1m/1m2f Group 1 winner Linngari); sole newcomer in the field and has her work cut out here.
