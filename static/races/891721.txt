🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not seen over hurdles since C&D win last July; in good nick from Flat though; considered
🔦 Spotlight: Not seen over hurdles since bagging a C&D handicap last July but he arrives in good nick from the Flat so must enter calculations.
Horse quote: 2024-07-04 at Perth (16f): "We were very disappointed last week at Carlisle so Doreen [Monteith, owner] said let's try Simple Star back over hurdles. He was a little star for us last year on the Flat. He came back this season and ran a great race at Musselburgh and then I think it was trainer error putting him into tracks that started with a downhill and he just got too keen. Hopefully, he'll be back at Musselburgh at the end of the Flat season - Dianne Sayer, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."
