🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Cheltenham Grade 2 Mares' Chase latest; slightly worse off at weights but hard to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Won the Grade 2 Mares' Chase at Cheltenham at the third attempt with an 8.5l success over Brides Hill and was getting the better of the argument with Allegorie De Vassy before that mare came down at the last; slightly worse off at the weights with those two but she'll be hard to beat with a repeat of that career best.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Dinoblue ran a great race last year and it didn't work out, today everything worked out for her. I'm just sorry for Allegorie De Vassy, she'd run a cracker of a race. She was jumping too big, would have preferred a bit of company up the front with her, I think. Might have just had her a little bit sharper. She was just ballooning fences and once I saw her doing that early in play, I didn't think she could be still challenging going to the last, because that takes a lot of energy out of them - Willie Mullins, trainer."

💬 Comment: Beaten fav in 2024's renewal; coming off second best to Dinoblue before fall latest
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten favourite in this race last year behind Brides Hill and was a well held third in 2023; was coming off second best to Dinoblue before coming down at the last at Cheltenham and hard to see her turning the tables with just a 1lb pull.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won lesser renewal of this last year; may struggle to reverse form despite 2lb pull
🔦 Spotlight: Won a lesser renewal of this race last year and back to her best when runner-up to Dinoblue at Cheltenham latest; 2lb better off at the weights now but may struggle to reverse the form; will need first-time cheekpieces to spark a career best.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Brides Hill ran a great race, but the winner was a very good winner. She was on their coat tails coming down the hill, but they just quickened away from her. I thought the last day she would win, but that was a good run and I expected her to run well. We might go onto Punchestown now - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Gr 3 winner in October but distant 3rd to Dinoblue at Cheltenham; tough ask
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner over fences including a Grade 3 novice success at Tipperary in October; distant third behind Dinoblue at Cheltenham suggests she has a mountain to climb here.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Shecouldbeanything ran a great race again and I'm very happy. She does fall slightly short of those top mares, but she has loads of experience now. I thought she ran above herself and we will probably go to the Irish Grand National now - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

💬 Comment: Career best 2nd in Gr 2 at Thurles in January but much more required here
🔦 Spotlight: Won a mares' beginners at Wexford last summer and career best when runner-up in a Grade 2 mares' at Thurles in January but this is a much tougher assignment and she was a well held seventh in a handicap off a mark of 129 at Leopardstown in the interim; tough ask on these terms.
Horse quote: 2023-04-27 at Punchestown (16f): "Broomfield Bijou had been running in decent company. She's a well-bred mare and she is one to look forward to. She will get further and likes nice ground - Philip Dempsey, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-12-31 at Punchestown (23f): "Must Be Obeyed was good and tough. I didn't know if she was up to winning that. I knew she would love the ground, staying chasing is what we talked about and the test of stamina really tested her - Tom Gibney, trainer."
