🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wetherby winner and fifth in Listed latest; should be very competitive despite penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Built upon her bumper debut fourth at Aintree (2m1f, good) in October to win in good style at Wetherby (2m, good to soft) in November; matched that form when fifth of ten in Market Rasen Listed bumper (2m, good to soft) in January; should be very competitive but does have to give weight to a number of interesting rivals.

💬 Comment: Point form has substance; favourite on C&D bumper debut but pulled hard; can do better now
🔦 Spotlight: Chased home a subsequent Willie Mullins bumper winner (pair clear) in a point last March; all the rage to make a winning bumper debut over C&D (heavy) on New Year's Eve but weakened into seventh after pulling too hard; evidently well regarded and could prove a different proposition now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second on Warwick debut but well beaten over this C&D since; has a hood added now
🔦 Spotlight: Half-sister to stable's useful bumper/jumps winner Midnightreferendum; kept on well for second of 11 behind better-fancied stablemate at Warwick in November but weakened when well held over C&D (good to soft again) on New Year's Eve; her rider reported that she raced too freely and she returns from a short break with a hood fitted; stable also runs Sharp Glance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yard not a regular source of bumper winners and likely best watched
🔦 Spotlight: Cost 15,000euros as a yearling and is the second foal of a 2m4f chase winner from the family of Master Oats; the stable's 2-37 bumper record in the last five seasons doesn't mark her down as a likely winner on debut.
