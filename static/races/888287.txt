🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hat-trick in points in March 2022 and he scored by 10l six weeks ago after long absence
🔦 Spotlight: Some Irish form under rules reads well but it was in the 2020-21 season and he never won in that sphere; 4-7 in points, thanks largely to a hat-trick in March 2022 but he also scored at Milborne St Andrew six weeks ago after a long absence and that win came by 10l; the one to beat.
