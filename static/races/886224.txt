🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made it 2-3 in handicaps at Southwell and the clear runner-up has firmly boosted that form
🔦 Spotlight: Won on handicap debut at Fontwell (2m3f, good to soft) in October and back to winning ways at Southwell (2m4f, good) in November; the horse he came clear with at Southwell has won his next two and this 🔍 unexposed 7yo could still be well treated even after a 9lb rise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't achieved much but the step up in trip could be a positive on his handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: He hasn't achieved much across his five starts but he caught the eye of the stewards when sixth here (2m1f, soft) in December; his dam has a good pedigree and the step up in trip could be a positive on his handicap debut, for which he has a modest mark; interesting; 📊 market check advised.

📝 Comment: raced in last, still plenty to do when hit 3 out, no chance before 2 out, some headway run-in (inquiry into running and riding; jockey said his instructions were to drop in, get gelding settled and jumping well as he has been keen, and finish as best as he could; he added gelding had relaxed after 2nd hurdle and he wanted him to continue to be 🔄 held up and not get too keen down the hill; he further stated gelding jumped 4th last hurdle slowly, and as he made up ground entering home straight he was stuck behind runners in a pocket; when approaching 2nd last, he asked for an effort having got a clear run but gelding stayed on at one paced to line passing no other runners and in his opinion had obtained best possible placing; trainer confirmed he was satisfied with ride and that it accorded with instructions given; vet had nothing to report)
