🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed off today's mark since last month's Fontwell win; likely contender again
🔦 Spotlight: Back in good form this year, winning in refitted cheekpieces at Fontwell (2m5f, soft) before good third off today's mark at Market Rasen (2m4f, good to soft); also suited by good ground and seems very likely to make his presence felt again.
