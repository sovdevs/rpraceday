🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wind op in December has worked the oracle; beat two of these over C&D 15 days ago; solid
🔦 Spotlight: Dropped in the weights last year and a wind operation in December has worked the oracle, finishing third here last month before beating a couple of today's rivals two weeks ago; 3lb rise shouldn't prevent another good run.

🔦 Spotlight: Made good progress in 2024, winning three times on turf; notably easy to back on his return from 169 days off here two weeks ago but he ran well in chasing home Ganesha (Darlo Pride a short head behind in third); could be more potent with the run behind him.
