🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Generally reliable 4yo who won over C&D last time; in the mix again from good draw

🔦 Spotlight: His last win was in September 2023 but he was disqualified from first (jockey weighed in light) last month and has held his form with three runner-up efforts since; ran into a well-handicapped rival who made all at Lingfield (6f, Polytrack) last week and he's respected back on Tapeta.

💬 Comment: Awarded a Lingfield race last month after Hierarchy was disqualified; respected up 1lb
🔦 Spotlight: 7yo who was useful in his prime; powers have been on the wane for a while but he ended a long losing run when he has awarded a Lingfield handicap (Hierarchy was disqualified) last month; only 1lb higher here and has possibilities if this sets up for his closing style.

🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who rolled back the years with a come-from-behind success at Newcastle (5f) in December; held in three runs since but he caught the eye with his late headway at Newcastle (fourth of ten) on Friday; that was a creditable effort after a slow start and he's not ruled out back up in trip.
