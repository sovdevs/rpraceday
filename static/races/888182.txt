💬 Comment: Both wins on soft and disappointing in one run on good; personal best latest; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins (point and a maiden hurdle) have come on soft and he underperformed on good ground at Ludlow last October (didn't jump well); ran his best race so far when second of 13 at Chepstow (near 3m, soft) 16 days ago; dangerous if reproducing it on the faster surface.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two wins in December when upped to 3m; beaten in a stronger race latest; major player
🔦 Spotlight: A step up to 3m and the addition of cheekpieces sparked a revival at Ludlow in December and he saw off 14 rivals when following up at Taunton eight days later; beaten favourite in a 0-130 at Taunton in his hat-trick bid but still ran to a similar level; big run on the cards.
