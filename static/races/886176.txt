🔦 Spotlight: 10yo whose form has deteriorated and he was soundly beaten at Haydock (2m, soft) last month; however, he showed some spark there in December (2m, heavy) and his last two wins have come over this C&D (soft/good to soft); interesting contender off a reduced mark in first-time cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10yo whose form has deteriorated, but fair third two runs ago and he likes it here
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo whose form has deteriorated and he was soundly beaten at Haydock (2m, soft) last month; however, he showed some spark there in December (2m, heavy) and his last two wins have come over this C&D (soft/good to soft); interesting contender off a reduced mark in first-time cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10yo whose form has deteriorated, but fair third two runs ago and he likes it here
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo whose form has deteriorated and he was soundly beaten at Haydock (2m, soft) last month; however, he showed some spark there in December (2m, heavy) and his last two wins have come over this C&D (soft/good to soft); interesting contender off a reduced mark in first-time cheekpieces.
