🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Boasts an outstanding career profile, previous vulnerability at this venue is a concern
🔦 Spotlight: Deprived of a third Cheltenham Gold Cup triumph by Inothewayurthinkin following a thoroughly satisfactory preparation in the shape of two Leopardstown wins, following the same pattern as last season; 2-6 record at this venue is the principal negative, especially since two of his defeats were inflicted by Fastorslow in this race; less worryingly, twice beaten over 2m4f here in the John Durkan on his seasonal debut, though Spillane's Tower got the better of the duel for second here last December.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (26.5f): "I just thought Galopin Des Champs was never happy until they got to the fourth last. During the race he was too far out of his ground and he wasn't jumping well enough to be in the race. He was uncomfortable. Maybe drying ground might not have helped. I thought we missed all that [when Ahoy Senor] fell and I thought that might wake him up as he was just idle. When he jumped off he was only in seventh. He was jumping too big and he wasn't jumping well enough. I was hoping something would get beside him and make him jump. To me he wasn't racing. The only time he got competitive was when they came around the fourth last at the top of the hill, and it looked alright. I just think he used too much of his powder jumping too big, but a good horse won it - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fine second in the John Durkan, disappointing in King George, may benefit from being fresh
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a Grade 1 double (2m4f/3m1f) last spring at Fairyhouse and this meeting, defeating Monty's Star on the latter occasion; made an excellent reappearance in the John Durkan at this venue, splitting Fact To File and Galopin Des Champs over a trip short of his optimum; ground may have been quicker ideal when posing no substantial threat behind Banbridge in the King George; being a fresh horse could be a significant asset here.
Horse quote: 2024-11-24 at Punchestown (19.5f): "I'm absolutely over the moon with Spillane's Tower. He hasn't been on grass since he won here at the festival. We couldn't, the ground has just been too firm. We have everything to look forward to now. Without a doubt that's the best race I've ever been involved in. You couldn't get any better - Jimmy Mangan, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m Grade 1 winner here last year, King George hero, needs to bounce back from Gold Cup bid
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 1 winner from Captain Guinness over 2m at last year's festival; first two runs this season continued the emphasis on tests of speed; proved he stays 3m on a level track when finishing strongly to win the King George at Kempton in refitted cheekpieces; weakened from three out when set tougher stamina test in the Gold Cup; this is less exacting with only four runners.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second to Spilane's Tower novice here last year, only three runs this term, plenty to find
🔦 Spotlight: Last year's Brown Advisory runner-up; finished the campaign with second to Spillane's Tower over C&D; only three runs this season; turned over at Tramore in January; ran well for a long way when beaten nearly 8l in fifth behind Galopin Des Champs at Leopardstown in February; almost unseated rider at the ninth in the Gold Cup and hampered at the 15th; recovered but faded from before the last.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (26.5f): "In fairness (that mistake) and having to avoid the horse that fell might have cost Monty's Star a place, but that is it. I like that ground for him I must say. He goes on any ground, but I thought it would help him today, but maybe it didn't. We are delighted and he ran a blinder. We will get our lad home now and see how he is before making any plans - Henry De Bromhead, trainer."
