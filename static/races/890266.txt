🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy hurdler has made a good start chasing; 🔥 big player and should handle better ground
🔦 Spotlight: Smart novice hurdler last season, rated 148 following second to stablemate Dancing City in 3m Grade 1 Punchestown novice; has made a good start to chasing career at same venue, second to a more experienced type over 3m before stepping up on that form to win 2m6f beginners last month; bypassed Cheltenham for this and 🔥 big player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needs to jump better than at Exeter; big chance if she does
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner whose hurdle wins include Grade 3 at Naas a year ago; quite impressive chasing debut over 2m4f at same venue in January (beating some decent types) but not at same level when fourth in 2m2f Exeter mares' novice last month, mistakes and lost a shoe; return to longer trip and mares' allowance both positives and given more fluent round of jumping could take some beating.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Debut chase win here in November; could have more to offer but faces some classy rivals
🔦 Spotlight: Surpassed anything he achieved over hurdles with debut chase win here over slightly further in November (good); just fair effort since back hurdling at this venue; could well have more to offer back chasing but faces some classy rivals.
