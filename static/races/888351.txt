🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising type; beaten at odds-on last time but may do better on this less testing ground
🔦 Spotlight: Second on his debut in the valuable bumper on this card 12 months ago; has taken pretty well to hurdling, easily landing the odds at Wincanton (good to soft) in December; ran creditably on form but was beaten at odds-on when third of seven on heavy ground there seven weeks ago; may still have more to offer on this less testing ground.
