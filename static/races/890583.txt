🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Personal best when making all at Newcastle five weeks ago; should go well again
🔦 Spotlight: Posted personal best in first-time tongue-strap five weeks ago, making all in four-runner race at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft); that was his fourth hurdles win, and with more improvement possible he should go well again.
Horse quote: 2024-10-26 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "Givemefive has been a fabulous little horse and well found by my cousin Megan [Nicholls]. From the first day we jumped him we knew we'd have some fun. I'm really proud, he's never let us down and this was a plan we've had for a long time and it's paid off. I won't do big handicaps until after Christmas, there's a race for four-year-olds at Fairyhouse next month or we leave him alone. He's got good days ahead of him and I'd love to run him in a Betfair Hurdle - Harry Derham, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Enhanced good Fakenham record when scoring bravely last time; cannot be dismissed
🔦 Spotlight: Having a productive season and took his record over 2m at Fakenham to 3-3 when scoring bravely five weeks ago; handles good and soft ground; up another 3lb but cannot be dismissed.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Fakenham (16f): "We might run Bluegrass in some nice handicaps on the Flat in the summer. He's fairly straightforward, he's very lazy at home. He's had a few wind operations and he runs in a tongue-tie for a reason - Stuart Edmunds, trainer."

💬 Comment: Capitalised on reduced mark at Taunton and far from disgraced at Aintree; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth of 17 in the Swinton Hurdle here last spring; capitalised on reduced mark at Taunton (2m, good to soft) in February and far from disgraced in warm race at Aintree two weeks ago; shortlisted.
Horse quote: 2021-09-13 at Worcester (16f): "Luttrell Lad is nice. He had very good bumper form and it was nice to get him started off over hurdles. He can be a bit fizzy but we went a good gallop there and it allowed him to settle and jump well. Day one is out of the way now and there's plenty to look forward to - Tom O'Brien, jockey."

💬 Comment: Below par since scoring at Wetherby in October; needs to be revitalised by cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Now 2lb lower than when scoring under Kevin Brogan at Wetherby (2m, good to soft) in October, but he seems to have been going through the motions since; needs to be revitalised by first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-02-07 at Sedgefield (17f): "I don't think it was much of a race, and Reach For The Moon ran below par, but Schmilsson is going the right way. It's taken him a couple of runs to relax but hopefully he can improve in handicaps. His work has always been nice at home and he got a good ride from Fergus [Gregory], who is riding really well at the moment - Olly Murphy, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handicapper looked in charge after two wins last May; now returns from five months off
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in quick succession (2m4f/2m) last May but the handicapper looked in charge after that; has slipped back down the weights but is still 1lb higher than for most recent success; returns from five months off.
Horse quote: 2022-10-20 at Carlisle (17f): "Well Educated has run well. They said he couldn't handle the soft ground but he's handled that all right. He's a grand horse who  does everything you want - George Bewley, trainer."
