💬 Comment: Has run three good races in 2m-2m3f handicaps and should be extremely hard to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Has run three good races in 2m-2m3f handicaps, last time only narrowly failing to justify favouritism in a Class 3 at Newbury (good; fine on softer); a repeat of that will see him extremely hard to beat.

💬 Comment: Showed more in bumpers than in points but it was still modest fare; hurdle debut
🔦 Spotlight: Minor form in Irish points but showed more in his two Worcester bumpers, especially first time when runner-up on good ground; that's still modest fare and he'll need to improve to make a winning start over hurdles.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't progressed since wind surgery but has ability
🔦 Spotlight: His best form is when pushing a classy horse close on bumper debut and he was later runner-up in a C&D novice; hasn't improved for wind surgery and was tailed off in an ordinary 2m4f handicap here last time; lots to prove now but this maiden race has no depth to it.
