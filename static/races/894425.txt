🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten by four stablemates when set a stern task at Fairyhouse, may find his level here
🔦 Spotlight: Failed to win in three bumper starts; won a C&D maiden on heavy ground on first attempt over hurdles; beaten by four shorter-priced stablemates when set a demanding task at Fairyhouse; now takes his place in the spotlight as the stable's only runner, with the form boosted by Irancy.
Horse quote: 2025-02-24 at Punchestown (16.5f): "He shows us plenty at home, but I suppose Runcok had been disappointing on the track. Maybe getting his head in front in a hurdle will help him now, he's a brilliant jumper. It was a good opportunity for him today. He loved jumping and an obstacle will definitely bring him on - Paul Townend, jockey"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart juvenile hurdle form, can hold his own if no ill effects from an Aintree fall
🔦 Spotlight: Flat maiden winner on good; only seventh on soft-ground hurdle debut but much improved when seeing off Willy De Houelle to win Grade 3 at Fairyhouse (yielding) just eight days later; respectable fourth under a penalty in Grade 2 at the Leopardstown Christmas meeting; fell three out when 16-1 in Grade 1 juvenile hurdle at Aintree; first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-12-01 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "Naturally Nimble disappointed us a little last week so we thought that we would hunt around and see what happened. He did it well. They went a good gallop and the race fell apart in front of us and we were there to pick up the pieces. He stuck at it well and he enjoyed the nice ground. He ran at a high level on the Flat and hopefully he can keep improving - Richie Deegan, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has shown a fair standard of form, probably needs to raise his game a little to win this
🔦 Spotlight: Flat winner for Andrew Kinirons; made a winning start over hurdles for this stable in an ordinary maiden at Gowran over 2m despite making a couple of jumping errors; next run at Navan was a major disappointment; much better when second at Naas, but probably needs to raise his game a little to win this.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Gowran Park (16f): "Casheldale Lad did it well. He jumped good overall but had a couple of little mistakes, one down the back and he got in under the last as well. For a horse to do that much and be able to quicken up again down to the second last shows he obviously has an engine - Jack Kennedy, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful sort on Flat, more on his plate than when winning at Naas, could be  competitive
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins and placed 11 times on the Flat (from 22 starts); signed off last season with a second over 1m4f at Cork off a respectable 91; second to an easy winner at Navan on hurdling debut; went one better at Naas early last month; more on his plate now
Horse quote: 2022-10-15 at Leopardstown (12f): "I think going up in trip and getting on to easy ground has been a help to Zoffman. Today he even looked like getting further. He's very small and I thought with a low weight he had a great chance. You're always surprised when they win as easy as that, but you're probably getting a free 7lb with Jamie Powell. He jumps quite well but won't be going hurdling at this time anyway. I couldn't imagine he'd make a jumper being so small - Noel Meade, trainer."

💬 Comment: Useful on Flat, won on hurdling debut at Naas, hard to be confident after Kelso defeat
🔦 Spotlight: Developed into a useful Flat performer last year (rated 90), made a bright start to hurdling career, winning 20-runner Naas maiden (2m, good to yielding); failed to build on that at Kelso, implying she may be vulnerable in this company.
Horse quote: 2024-08-25 at Naas (10.5f): "Fiver Friday handled the course here from her maiden form  and for her to get her head in front in Ireland is brilliant. They went plenty hard early on and set it up for her - Paul Traynor, trainer."
