🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came good for current stable at second attempt; major player under a penalty here
🔦 Spotlight: Built upon encouraging stable debut (over C&D) when winning 1m2f Lingfield classified in refitted cheekpieces on Monday, opening his account at the 18th attempt; has 5lb penalty on this handicap return but still needs to be taken very seriously in current mood.
