🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced; landed gamble at Southwell last month and probably has more in the tank
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 5yo; justified strong support to win handicap at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) last month, cajoled to lead two out and having more in hand than the bare margin; up 9lb but probably has more in the tank.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some promise in novices; this longer trip should suit; interesting on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: 0-4 under rules but he has shown some promise, 16l third of ten at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) 17 days ago; bred to be well suited by today's step up in distance and he's an interesting contender on handicap debut despite top weight.
