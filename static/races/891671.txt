🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tailed off in a Listed race last time; had beaten a useful horse on debut at Ascot
🔦 Spotlight: The hood worn for his first two races is removed; won narrowly from off the pace at Ascot (good) but then finished tailed off in a Listed race there when 33-1 (good to soft); respected on that initial effort as the second is a useful horse; perhaps unwise to read too much into Harry Cobden riding for an outside yard as Jay Tidball has been aboard for this gelding's first two runs.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a weak race on debut and was well beaten under his penalty after a layoff
🔦 Spotlight: Won a weak four-runner race at Worcester in May 2023 and not seen again until last month when well beaten under a penalty at Huntingdon; stable looks to have better chances.
Horse quote: 2023-05-26 at Worcester (16f): "Chris (Gordon) said he quite liked Jefe Triunfo beforehand. I think he's probably too nice to keep going right the way through the summer - Harry Cobden, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
