🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off the mark over fences with headgear latest; the longer trip should suit; 4lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Gained first chase win (with cheekpieces tried a second time) when scoring at Newcastle latest (2m4f, good to soft; second start for present yard), rallying well after getting outpaced; headgear retained; shapes as though the step up in trip will suit and he's a player off this 4lb higher mark.

📝 Comment: in touch with leaders, not fluent 4th, lost position 4 out, rallied and went modest fourth after 3 out (jockey said, regarding running and riding, that he had no specific instructions from trainer so he elected to ride gelding mid-division but handy in order to give him his best chance; he explained that gelding ran a little keen in early stages, having had a long lay-off, but he was happy with his position and with way gelding was travelling, although he was jumping big and green, adding that he had kept wide to find better ground going down back straight; he added that gelding had come off the bit having jumped 4 out and was struggling to hold his position so he switched to rail in home straight in order to give gelding some help; once there, gelding was clumsy over first 2 hurdles so he held him together in order to get him home safely and maintained that he was finishing one-paced and had only made ground on Paradias, which finished 3rd, in closing stages because that horse was stopping so quickly; he confirmed that he had spoken with trainer after race and had advised that, although gelding seemed to handle the ground described as soft, heavy in places, he might benefit from a step up in trip)

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-10; fair 4th on chase debut but too free when below par last time; not sure to stay 3m
🔦 Spotlight: Ten-race maiden; creditable fourth on chase debut here in November (2m5f, good) but too free when well beaten at Hexham last time (2m4f, soft); needs to settle better now stepped up to 3m for the first time.

💬 Comment: Off the mark over fences with headgear latest; the longer trip should suit; 4lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Gained first chase win (with cheekpieces tried a second time) when scoring at Newcastle latest (2m4f, good to soft; second start for present yard), rallying well after getting outpaced; headgear retained; shapes as though the step up in trip will suit and he's a player off this 4lb higher mark.
