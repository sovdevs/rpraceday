🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form since hooded, winning twice on AW and close 2nd over C&D latest; solid claims
🔦 Spotlight: Having dropped a long way in the weights he was revived by the application of a hood in February, winning a 6f 0-50 classified event at Newcastle in good style; followed up in a handicap back there one week later and he was a close second over C&D on this month's return turf; 1lb rise shouldn't prevent another big run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-10 in Ireland but her best form makes her of major interest on her stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: 0-10 in Ireland but she did best of those drawn low when second of 18 at Navan last July (6f, good to firm; strong form for the grade); creditable 1m run at Killarney two days later; absent for 285 days but she makes her stable/British debut in a less competitive race than she's used to; yard does well here and she's of some interest.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner; best of prominent racers when 3rd of 17 at Thirsk latest; each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: Gained his last win at this track (7f, good to soft) back in October 2023; operating off a reduced mark now and did best of the prominent racers when third of 17 at Thirsk two weeks ago (6f, good); would seem more likely to give his running than many.
Horse quote: 2020-09-13 at Curragh (6.5f): "Shark Two One is a lovely little horse. I probably got there soon enough but he quickened up well and was maybe getting a bit lonely going to the line - Colin Keane, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to shine for this yard but returning to turf looks favourable and he's on a handy mark
🔦 Spotlight: Free-going sort who hasn't been at his best for his new stable on AW this year; now 10lb lower than for his Ayr win last summer (7f, good), however, and no surprise were the return to turf to have a positive effect.
Horse quote: 2023-10-16 at Musselburgh (7f): "Pembrokeshire completely boiled over in the paddock last time and ran his race before he even got down to start. Dom [Hislop] has done a good job leading him up, he's kept a lid on him and got him down to the start in one piece. He had a good gallop to aim at, he was able to get into a rhythm and I thought he stayed the seven [furlongs] quite well - Iain Jardine, trainer."
