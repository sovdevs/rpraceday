🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last time can be ignored but this is his first visit here and he'll need a strong pace
🔦 Spotlight: In and out this year but he's down in the weights and last week's Newcastle eighth (behind Midnightattheoasis) isn't the run to judge him on as he ran into traffic at a crucial stage and lost all his momentum; first run at Chelmsford.
