🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Highly creditable fourth in the County Hurdle and could have more to offer in this code
🔦 Spotlight: Easily won maiden hurdle at Punchestown (2m, heavy) in February and highly creditable fourth in the County Hurdle at Cheltenham (2m1f, good to soft) last month; effective on good ground on the Flat; could have more to offer in this code and he's a major player up 1lb for last time.
Horse quote: 2025-02-03 at Punchestown (16f): "Ethical Diamond got a freebie in front and jumped well. Paul said he is learning all the time with his jumping and hopefully he can build on it - David Casey, assistant trainer"

💬 Comment: Second in warm handicaps the last twice and this 🔍 unexposed 5yo could continue to progress
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 3-3 when winning on handicap debut at Kempton and runner-up in warm races the next twice (1m7f/2m, good to soft/soft); this 🔍 unexposed 5yo could continue to progress and is firmly in calculations.
Horse quote: 2024-12-21 at Ascot (15.5f): "We're thrilled and for a four-year-old it was a mighty run. Kabral Du Mathan will go straight to the Betfair Hurdle [February 8] now, we won't run him before then and we'll look after him. It's hard for four-year-olds in their second season, but that was a very good run and he's a progressive horse - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way in the Coral Cup despite pulling hard; now drops back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Close second at Clonmel (made bad mistake) in January; pulled hard and pulled up in the Coral Cup at Cheltenham (2m5f) on first run beyond 2m1f but it's to his credit that he was still in the front rank entering the straight; could play a leading role now back down in trip.
Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Limerick (16f): "Bunting is a nice horse, he did everything well and showed a lovely attitude. He jumped well, just had a little look over the last two, but he did it well - Sean O'Keeffe, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way in the Coral Cup despite pulling hard; now drops back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Close second at Clonmel (made bad mistake) in January; pulled hard and pulled up in the Coral Cup at Cheltenham (2m5f) on first run beyond 2m1f but it's to his credit that he was still in the front rank entering the straight; could play a leading role now back down in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed in Grade 2 novice at Cheltenham last October but down the field in his 3 h'caps
🔦 Spotlight: Easily made all in Grade 2 novice hurdle at Cheltenham (2m, good) last October and he's on a handy mark on that form; it's possible he'll get back on track at some stage but he's finished down the field in all three handicaps, most recently the County Hurdle at Cheltenham, and has something to prove.
Horse quote: 2024-10-25 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "I thought Valgrand was a player but I didn't think he could do that. I thought he could win but I felt the mare [Gale Mahler] would be very hard to beat. I won't be taking the form too literal but he stays and jumped very well. To put up the performance he did from the back of three out to the line is very taking. The times will be pretty fancy. We need to see another race to make sure that wasn't a fluke - we always thought he'd be quite good and progressive. If he does run to a level like that again then we could be dreaming. We'll keep our feet and his feet on the floor and check what's what - Dan Skelton, trainer."

💬 Comment: Good third in the Greatwood in November; could have a part to play now back down in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won her first six starts under rules before creditable third in the Greatwood at Cheltenham (2m, good) in November; soundly beaten the next twice but it was the Grade 1 Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham (2m4f) last time and she could have a part to play now back in a handicap and back down in trip.
Horse quote: 2024-11-17 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "Dysart Enos jumped the best she's ever done and we were hoping the speed of the race would help her and it did. Every time she saw a hurdle she attacked it. I always felt I was on the winner. She even gave me the confidence after two out to sit again and it was only after the point of the bend that I thought I wouldn't. The winner is a good horse and there are plenty of positives to take from the run of our mare. We can be more adventurous with the way we ride her in future, too - Jonathan Burke, jockey."

💬 Comment: Better than ever on the Flat and over hurdles last year; last two Flat wins came here
🔦 Spotlight: 8yo who was better than ever on the Flat and over hurdles last year, finishing third in the Grade 1 Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle (2m, good) in November when last seen; his last two Flat wins have come at this venue and he's an interesting contender now back here and reverting to a handicap.
Horse quote: 2024-08-24 at York (14f): "Kihavah is a great horse and does brilliant things for our yard. Hopefully he's around for a long time. He ran a blinder but if you could predict the future and were a few pounds lower and were able to get in, that'd been an ideal scenario. The winner won well though, and we ran a brilliant race and are delighted. The mile and six stretches his stamina and that's as far as he wants to be going - Adrian Keatley, trainer."

💬 Comment: Lightly raced 6yo who still has time on her side, but pulled up in November when last seen
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who was runner-up in a Grade 2 mares' hurdle last January and fair sixth in the competitive Galway Hurdle in August; in top hands and still has time on her side, but she was pulled up in the Greatwood at Cheltenham in November when last seen.
Horse quote: 2023-04-29 at Sandown (16f): "Under Control is a sweet little thing. We've only had her for a short time. She's not very big but has grown in stature the whole way through. That was a big ask to do that after running at Cheltenham. We were worried she wouldn't go in the ground today. She's never stopped improving - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won two handicaps late last year and good third in mares' Grade 2 at Ascot (1m7f, good) in January; didn't run badly in mid-division for Imperial Cup latest but needs something extra in another competitive handicap today.
Horse quote: 2023-11-29 at Hereford (19.5f): "Ooh Betty has won three of her last five races and she's a decent mare. Quick ground is imperative to her and we'll try and find another race in three or four weeks - which is optimistic - otherwise we'll give her a break. Even good to soft is too soft for her - Ben Clarke, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Kelso specialist but close third in this 12 months ago and might not be far away
🔦 Spotlight: All four handicap wins at Kelso, including last month's Morebattle (second year running), but he was a close third in this last year and ran well when seventh in the County at Cheltenham last time; might not be far away.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Kelso (16f): "I thought it was a deeper race this year and Cracking Rhapsody was 13lb higher. I said this morning I'd have been over the moon if he finished third or fourth.  But he loves it here obviously, doesn't he?  He won in December then he didn't run badly at Windsor, he made a mistake at the last or he'd probably have finished a bit closer, it stopped his momentum which maybe wasn't a bad thing coming here today. We put him in the County Hurdle, thought if he wins or is just beaten he may go. We'll definitely look at it - the Scottish Champion could be a nice race but I'm mindful the ground at Ayr can dry up at that time of year - Ewan Whillans, trainer."

💬 Comment: Made if four wins from his last four starts when scoring at Musselburgh; in with a chance
🔦 Spotlight: Made it four wins from his last six starts when landing the Scottish County Hurdle at Musselburgh (extended 1m7f, good to soft) in February; 4lb higher in a much hotter race today but this 📈 progressive 7yo could still have more left in the tank, especially now back at a more galloping track.

🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m3f maiden and fourth in 2m Grade 1 later in December; however, tailed off in Grade 1 next time (2m, soft) and same story in the Martin Pipe at Cheltenham (2m4f, good to soft) last month; needs to raise his game.
Horse quote: 2024-12-03 at Clonmel (19.5f): "Karafon jumped brilliant, settled great and his form entitled him to do it like that. He'll step up in grade now - Patrick Mullins, rider."
