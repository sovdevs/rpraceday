🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up on hurdling debut in December but has fared much better on both starts for new stable this year, more recently when winning Hereford maiden (2m3f, good) by 8l last month; drops back in trip for handicap debut; could easily have more to offer.

💬 Comment: Ridden clear to cause 20-1 surprise when back over hurdles last month; drops back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Has poor completion record over fences this season but was ridden clear to cause 20-1 surprise when back over hurdles at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) a fortnight ago; not sure to be ideally suited by today's drop back to 2m but the faster ground won't be a problem and a recent 6lb rise ought to be manageable.
