🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 12l win from the front here (2m4f, heavy) saw him off the mark at 14th go over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Much better again again when the tongue-tie and visor went on for last two outings, last time making all to justify favouritism in a 15-runner handicap here (2m4f, heavy) by 12l, which was some way to get off the mark at 14th attempt; 11lb higher today and 10lb claimer Cameron Johnstone-Baker is recruited, having guided a winning favourite for the yard on Sunday.

💬 Comment: Has often looked tricky customer but had wind surgery before recent hurdles breakthrough
🔦 Spotlight: Two Flat wins; has often looked a tricky customer but had wind surgery before making the breakthrough in this sphere at the 14th attempt, nine days ago, when always prominent to take 11-runner novice handicap at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft; acts on heavy) in clearcut style; that came off 24lb lower than his peak mark and this 7lb penalty isn't daunting judged on his old form.

💬 Comment: Rallied to make up late ground last twice; first-time cheekpieces on this handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced since winning as a 2yo on the Flat in Ireland, but was placed at Fakenham (2m/2m4f) in January in the last two of his three starts over hurdles; rallied to make up late ground in those hurdle races, which offers some hope for a slog and first-time cheekpieces on today's handicap debut.

🔦 Spotlight: 18-1, 40-1 and 150-1 for his three maiden/novice hurdles, best form when fourth of 13 at Newbury (2m, soft) last time even though he was 19l behind the third; no shock if this longer trip suits on handicap debut and a much more competitive display could be forthcoming.
