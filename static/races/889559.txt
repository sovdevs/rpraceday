🔦 Spotlight: Comes here chasing a quick hat-trick and although he's 5lb worse off with Pop Dancer for just a neck on their Newcastle run on Tuesday, he might be well suited by how this is likely to be run; Rossa Ryan retains the ride; the one to beat.

🔦 Spotlight: On a dangerous mark and he made a bold bid at Newcastle on Tuesday, unable to hold the late challenge of the reopposing Midnightatheoasis; 5lb better off for a neck today but likely to face competition up front and the placings may be upheld.
