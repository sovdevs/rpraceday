🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has gone close in h'cap chases lately; major claims if transferring ability back to timber
🔦 Spotlight: Has spent the last two seasons over fences; went close in competitive handicaps at Fairyhouse either side of Christmas and respectable ninth in the Grand Annual since; 🔥 big player if he transfers all that ability back to hurdles.
Horse quote: 2024-02-11 at Navan (24f): "American Mike is probably one of the horses that makes me scratch my head more than any other. He keeps disappointing me and then he comes back with a good one again. He has obviously a big engine on his day, when he's right, but he's not easy to train. He's in a few of the novice chases at Cheltenham and he could go for an Irish National - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner last season before finishing runner-up in a mares' Listed race at this meeting; has failed to complete in three runs this term but was about to have a major say before coming down at Clonmel when last seen; major player with a clear round.
Horse quote: 2024-04-04 at Naas (16f): "Got Glory was gassy and wanted to get into it. She has had problems but they have been very patient and she does very smart work - Paul Townend, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Distant 4th behind Kopek Des Bordes at DRF before pulled up at the Festival; cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner at Leopardstown over Christmas before a distant fourth behind Kopek Des Bordes at the Dublin Racing Festival; pulled up in the Turners last time and may be more of a chaser for next season; wears first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Leopardstown (20f): "Kaid d'Authie is a lovely big, long-striding horse who has very little respect for his hurdles and looks like he could be more of a chaser. He's a big chasing type and is similar to Majborough. They both cover a huge amount of ground when they gallop.  I'd say he'll come back here for the Dublin Racing Festival and take on the top two-milers and we'll see where he is then - Willie Mullins, trainer."
