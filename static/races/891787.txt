🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looks interesting with blinkers refitted on second run for new stable
🔦 Spotlight: Blinkered when performing well at Newbury (won) and Kempton (second) in final two starts for previous yard; interesting with the blinds refitted on second run for new stable.
Horse quote: 2023-09-06 at Bath (5.5f): "It was such a good race at Ascot. Obviously the winner won the Acomb, and Ralph Beckett likes his horse a lot too. I ran North View over too far at Newmarket, that was my fault, so it was nice to see him win today. I wouldn't be opposed to dropping him back to five furlongs either because he has so much speed. He's the sort of horse we will go slowly with and see what the handicapper does with him before making any fancy entries but I promise you he's better than that - Peter Chapple-Hyam, trainer."

💬 Comment: Form dipped sharply last month, suggesting he's gone off the boil
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time AW scorer, most recently in January; went close over C&D in February but form dipped sharply (in two runs) last month, suggesting he's gone off the boil.
Horse quote: 2023-07-29 at Newmarket (July) (6f): "Tiger Crusade has a lower mark on turf as he has not won for a long time but he stays seven furlongs and on that slightly tacky ground he was always going to finish off six furlongs well. He has been running on quicker ground on the turf, but I think he likes to get his toe in a little bit. That trip today on that ground was perfect for him - Bryan Payne, part owner."

🔦 Spotlight: Raced only on turf when trained by Ismail Mohammed and is 0-12 since winning on first two starts; enough to prove on debut for 🆕 new yard; still with same owner.
Horse quote: 2023-08-11 at Thirsk (7f): "We worked Nibras Angel before the race and we really think she's a quality filly. We work her with most of our horses and she runs away from everybody. I was worried two or three days ago because a horse kicked her in the bit on Warren Hill, she made lots of noise, but she was fine. We have to see how she'll come out of the race, I don't know if we'll go directly to the Sun Chariot or find a Group 3 or a Listed race for her. She didn't run as a two-year-old and when we work her she's still babyish and green - Ismail Mohammed, trainer."

💬 Comment: Folded tamely on reappearance; AW is an unknown
🔦 Spotlight: Similar type to Nibras Angel, having raced only on turf; something to prove in this scenario and reappearance effort (folded tamely, well held) adds uncertainty.
Horse quote: 2023-04-21 at Newbury (5f): "I was worried about running Dapper Valley on the ground, but he's always shown up a good bit at home and I loved the way he travelled. He took it in his stride and could be a very good two-year-old. I imagine we'll look at something else - possibly a race back here at the Lockinge meeting - before he is hopefully a Royal Ascot horse -  Richard Hannon, trainer."
