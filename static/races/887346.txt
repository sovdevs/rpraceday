üî¶ Spotlight: Unraced on heavy, otherwise looks versatile ground-wise; smart, consistent and has several pieces of Grade 1 form, including good third in the Supreme at this meeting 12 months ago despite meeting trouble; chase record features creditable efforts in the Drinmore (2m4f) and the Irish Arkle (2m1f); brings class to this first handicap attempt and has to be feared.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Gets into this handicap off an attractive mark; Grade 1 hurdle winner for previous stable
üî¶ Spotlight: Grade 1 novice hurdle winner over 2m in Ireland and sold for 740,000euros at the Caldwell dispersal sale; hasn't strictly lived up to that price tag for new connections, notwithstanding an easy win on chase debut, and he finished weakly over C&D (good to soft; behind Springwell Bay on worse terms) in December; beaten favourite in Grade 2 since; however, gets into this handicap off an attractive mark (5lb lower than hurdles rating) and the return to 2m4f is worth exploring judged on pedigree; interesting.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Scored over 2m last time; lacks consistency and has something to prove back at 2m4f
üî¶ Spotlight: Took well to first-time cheekpieces in Naas handicap (2m, soft) when last seen, adding to his Galway win (2m2f, good; chase debut); not certain to remain in the same form, having lacked consistency and bearing in mind that his record at about 2m4f is far from solid; headgear retained.

üî¶ Spotlight: Creditable third in the Coral Cup here on final start last term; not in anything like the same form over fences this season and the application of cheekpieces (retained today) had no effect last time; 5lb out of the weights; the return to Cheltenham needs to spark a big revival.
