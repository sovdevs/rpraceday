🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart, consistent and has several pieces of Grade 1 form (hurdles/fences); major player
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on heavy, otherwise looks versatile ground-wise; smart, consistent and has several pieces of Grade 1 form, including good third in the Supreme at this meeting 12 months ago despite meeting trouble; chase record features creditable efforts in the Drinmore (2m4f) and the Irish Arkle (2m1f); brings class to this first handicap attempt and has to be feared.

💬 Comment: Fourth in the Triumph 12 months ago; has a very attractive chase mark; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: Respectable fourth in the Triumph here 12 months ago and landed the Galway Hurdle (on good ground) in August; never got into a rhythm in latest chase start but looks ready for a crack at this new trip (first go beyond 2m1f) and the reapplication of cheekpieces (second attempt) is another possible aid; has a very attractive mark judged on hurdles form; one for the shortlist returned to the Cheltenham Festival.

🔦 Spotlight: Always ridden by Thomas Costello; creditable fourth in the Supreme at this meeting last year; point winner in 2023 and ran creditably, in third place, behind notable stablemates in beginners chases at Fairyhouse the last twice; campaigned only at about 2m since joining Willie Mullins but should be as effective back up in trip; potentially ahead of his mark and looks interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gets into this handicap off an attractive mark; Grade 1 hurdle winner for previous stable
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 1 novice hurdle winner over 2m in Ireland and sold for 740,000euros at the Caldwell dispersal sale; hasn't strictly lived up to that price tag for new connections, notwithstanding an easy win on chase debut, and he finished weakly over C&D (good to soft; behind Springwell Bay on worse terms) in December; beaten favourite in Grade 2 since; however, gets into this handicap off an attractive mark (5lb lower than hurdles rating) and the return to 2m4f is worth exploring judged on pedigree; interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well behind Lord Of Thunder at Newbury; threatening to regain the winning thread
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on heavy, acts on any other ground; rather a frustrating sort, having registered just one win (over hurdles) and finished second lots of times, most recently behind Lord Of Thunder at Newbury (third attempt in this sphere); however, has steadily 📈 progressive RPRs and is certainly threatening to double his tally; enters calculations.

🔦 Spotlight: Good second to Springwell Bay at Chepstow on chase debut and resumed improvement with an emphatic win in Musselburgh handicap (2m4f, good to soft) most recently; faces a stiffer assignment off revised mark in this much deeper field and Harry Cobden sides with stablemate Caldwell Potter.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In-form 10yo but the stats are against him (no horse older than nine has won this race)
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable third in notable novice handicap over C&D last term; record of 2-4 this season includes a solid win at Sandown (2m4f, good to soft; beat a subsequent scorer) last time; however, the age stats are against this 10yo, as veterans have rarely contested this prize and no horse older than nine has won it; 2lb out of the weights.
