🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won well on his recent return at Chelmsford; 8lb higher but is capable of more
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't show much in four starts last year (well backed final outing) but having been off for six months and ✂️ gelded he made a successful handicap debut in great style at Chelmsford (7f, Polytrack) 17 days ago; handicapper didn't miss him with an 8lb rise but Warren Fentiman's 5lb claim will help and he looks capable of more.
