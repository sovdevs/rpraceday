💬 Comment: Won a weak Irish point but has joined a good yard and market support could be significant
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for 42,000gns after winning a small-field 3m Irish point by 2l on good to yielding; that's not strong form with the runner-up 1-10 in points and 0-10 over hurdles; still, has joined a good yard and market support could be significant.

🔦 Spotlight: Point/bumper winner; weakened into fifth in a field of six when taking on male opposition in her first hurdle at Market Rasen (2m4f, good to soft) and will need to improve on that form; the new hood could help.

🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner; front-runner who races with the choke out but has still finished runner-up the last twice, latterly behind a well-backed winner in a 2m4f handicap at Ffos Las (good to soft); this looks easier and Plumpton should suit her running style.
