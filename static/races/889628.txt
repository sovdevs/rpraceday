💬 Comment: Plenty in hand for Wolverhampton wins at 1m4f and 9.4f last month; still capable of better
🔦 Spotlight: Found stacks of improvement when upped to 1m4f at Wolverhampton on handicap debut last month, justifying 6-4 favouritism by 4l, and he also had plenty in hand when following up at 1-4 over 9.4f there ten days later; another 9lb higher today (15lb higher than first win) but he's probably a fair bit better than that as well.
