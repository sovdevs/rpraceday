🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form when last seen but that was 700 days ago; plenty to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Had a wind operation prior to landing a gamble at Bath in April 2023 (11.5f, soft); two solid efforts followed that spring but he's been absent for 700 days and would need to be notably strong in the market to warrant an interest on his return.

🔦 Spotlight: 7lb lower than for his 2m Chelmsford win last January but he hasn't been at his best in three runs this year (after 285 days off); down in weights but with plenty to prove.
