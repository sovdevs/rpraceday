🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 2 novice hurdle winner who got off the mark over fences last time; solid claims
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2 novice hurdle winner who got off the mark over fences at the fourth attempt in a three-runner novice at Warwick (3m, soft) last month in first-time cheekpieces (retained); has also won on good to soft ground; could have more to offer for top yard now back in a handicap; solid claims.

💬 Comment: Made it 4-4 over fences at Kelso and a 4lb rise could prove lenient; strong contender
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 4-4 over fences in convincing fashion at Kelso (extended 2m5f, good to soft) a fortnight ago; stamina to prove now back up in trip but this 3m point runner-up has staying potential and a 4lb rise for last time could prove lenient for this lightly raced 6yo; strong contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Aintree (3m1f, soft) in December and good second at Windsor (3m4f, soft) next time; fair third at Carlisle (3m, good to soft) since; he may prefer a stiffer test of stamina than he'll get on today's forecast good to soft ground, but he's only six and could still have more left in the tank; first-time blinkers replace the cheekpieces worn the last twice.

💬 Comment: Won in cheekpieces at Ludlow in a race that fell apart, but he was impressive nevertheless
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to form with a win in first-time cheekpieces at Ludlow (3m, soft) last month; that four-runner handicap fell apart somewhat but he was nevertheless impressive and could take a 4lb rise in his stride if the cheekpieces maintain their positive effect; also effective on good to soft.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two wins in November; heavy ground perhaps not ideal last time; each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row in November (3m/3m2f, good) and close second at Wincanton (3m1f, good to soft) in December; soundly beaten second at Exeter three weeks ago but heavy ground may not have been ideal; each-way shout.
