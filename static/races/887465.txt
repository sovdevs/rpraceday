💬 Comment: Runner-up in his last three starts on turf last year; should take all the beating
🔦 Spotlight: Smart form in finishing runner-up in last three starts on turf over 7f/1m last year, surrounded by subsequent winners on each occasion; returns from six months off (been ✂️ gelded) and, with the longer trip not an issue on breeding, he should take all the beating for last year's winning stable.

🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to seven winners and he suggested he will be winning races in his own right when coming on from his debut to finish third of 12 at Kempton (1m, Polytrack; 125-1) last month; each-way claims if stepping up again, but faces a formidable rival in Pantile Warrior for win purposes.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some promise on debut but didn't look straightforward when last next time; plenty to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Some promise when beaten around 14l into fourth of eight on his Kempton debut (1m3f, Polytrack) in January, but didn't look straightforward when a well-beaten last of five at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) last month; plenty to prove.

💬 Comment: Well beaten in two starts on turf last year; stiff task on her return
🔦 Spotlight: 110,000euros yearling; well held in boths starts last year, at Deauville (7f, good) and Haydock (1m, soft); longer trip should suit given her stamina-laden pedigree, but this still looks a stiff task on her return.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice placed at Kempton last year but last two starts modest; returns from five months off
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten a nose at Kempton (1m, Polytrack; 66-1) last August and third of 13 over same C&D the following month, but his last two efforts leave plenty to be desired (cheekpieces removed after one use); bred to appreciate the longer trip, but needs a resurgence back from five months off having been ✂️ gelded in the meantime.
