💬 Comment: Record over C&D since last August reads 131215; high on the list under these conditions
🔦 Spotlight: Record over C&D since last August reads 131215 and he looked unfortunate not to finish closer last month; still 4lb above his last winning mark but still high on the list under these suitable conditions.
Horse quote: 2025-02-28 at Southwell (AW) (7f): "King Of Ithaca did it well getting there way earlier than I wanted to be but he got the job done. They get racing from the top of the straight here so it kind of suits him but he doesn't want to be in front too soon and even being there at the furlong pole was soon enough. There should be more to come but everything has to go to plan and even today it didn't as they didn't go much of a gallop - Rossa Ryan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Back off last winning mark but needs to better his two performances since returning
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins on Polytrack/turf last year and back off the same mark as when successful at Newmarket (7f, good to firm) last September; needs to better his two performances since returning last month, though.
Horse quote: 2024-09-21 at Newmarket (7f): "It was a funny race. They went off too fast in front and I held onto their coat tails and Brunel Nation toughed it out - winning rider Finley Marsh"

💬 Comment: Five wins over 7f on turf; ran well on Musselburgh return but poorly in his only AW start
🔦 Spotlight: All five wins over 7f on turf, three of them last year; ran well when fourth of 12 at Musselburgh (7f, good) a fortnight ago on his return from six months off, but he ran poorly in his one AW start (at Newcastle) which poses a question.
Horse quote: 2024-07-06 at Leicester (7f): "There is quite a stiff side and head wind now, but he still picked up lovely. I know he's also won at Redcar and Catterick, but he probably has more strengthening to do and confidence to gain - Faye McManoman, rider, speaking to Racing TV."
