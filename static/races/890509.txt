🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 6yo who delivered on earlier promise when winning Fontwell maiden (2m3f, good) last month; moves back up in trip for this handicap debut and probably still has potential; must be considered.
Horse quote: 2025-03-17 at Fontwell (19f): "We'll keep Dwight K Schrute on the go for the next 6-8 weeks but he'll have a break over the summer before going over fences next season - Jamie Snowden, trainer, talking to Sky Sports."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up at Wetherby two starts ago but quickly back in the doldrums last month
🔦 Spotlight: Seemingly perked up by change of headgear when second at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in February, but quickly back in the doldrums at Ayr (2m, soft) last month; should be fine over today's trip but rarely runs on ground quicker than soft and others in the line-up have more persuasive profiles.
Horse quote: 2022-10-29 at Galway (24f): "Royal Rhythm got a fantastic ride from James because in my mind the others went way too quick and they were racing too early. He kept taking him back and he probably won too well, he was the only one that finished - Philip Rothwell, trainer."
