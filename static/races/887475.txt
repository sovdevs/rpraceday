🔦 Spotlight: Has a fine strike-rate (11-45) and was better than ever when winning at Lingfield (1m2f) last month, getting up near finish; edging up the weights but should be in the thick of things once more.

💬 Comment: Very lightly raced 7yo; not without a chance if building on second run after long absence
🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced 7yo; 2-2 for Charlie Appleby but those races were in 2020 and 2021; probably needed first run back from mammoth absence and showed more when close sixth of nine at Lingfield (1m) three weeks ago; not without a chance if building again on that.
