🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below par on both runs this year but this C&D winner has dropped to a dangerous mark
🔦 Spotlight: Has a modest 1-16 strike-rate and she hasn't been at her best on AW on her two runs this year; however, she's now 4lb lower than when a commanding winner over C&D (good to firm) last August and she'll be a major player if rediscovering some form.
