💬 Comment: 5-10 for stable after Fakenham win in January; further progress is possible
🔦 Spotlight: 5-10 over hurdles since joining current stable last spring and posted career-best performance when too strong for subsequent winner Greyval at Fakenham (2m4f, good) in January; further progress is possible.
Horse quote: 2024-05-08 at Fontwell (19f): "Mermaids Cave was straightforward considering what was going on around her. She was straight as a bullet. We've dropped her out today and she seemed to gain confidence coming through horses. Going forward I think she's one to look forward to, I couldn't fault her and she was foot perfect - Alex Chadwick, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2023-01-27 at Doncaster (16.5f): "Greyval was superb value at 36,000euros and I loved the stamp of her. She wasn't going to be in the Triumph but we popped her in this week, but I doubt she'll go for that. I don't do social runners but we can dream. She's in the Mares' Novice and I half prefer that, but there's a lot of water and bridges - Nick Brown, racing manager of the owners Oakley Partnership."

💬 Comment: No better than a respectable fourth on stable debut but may yet revive for Dan Skelton
🔦 Spotlight: Well below best for Nicky Henderson this season and was no better than a respectable fourth on last month's stable debut at Chepstow (2m3f, good) but has slipped to a good mark and may yet revive for Dan Skelton.
Horse quote: 2023-12-23 at Haydock (19f): "Pawapuri stayed on well. It was her first time over 2m4f and going down the last I thought '****, we've got another 300 yards left' but she finished well. She's a better mare this season and she's got black type now - James Bowen, winning jockey."

Horse quote: 2025-01-01 at Southwell (20.5f): "All The Glory has only won on good to soft in the past, so the plan was always to go wide. I was happy with where I was and kept filling her up.  She always meets the hurdles right - she figures it out herself and she's a dream to ride - Ben Macey, rider, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Slightly below form on latest outing but has generally done well this season, winning twice; now 1lb lower than when placed in Scottish County Hurdle at Musselburgh (1m7f, good to soft) two starts ago and will be fine over today's trip; no surprise if she features.

🔦 Spotlight: Produced good performance to win 14-runner Aintree handicap (2m4f, good) last May but has not hit the same heights since returning from a break in the autumn, and was particularly disappointing when last in action; others have less to prove.
Horse quote: 2024-01-10 at Doncaster (19.5f): "Alex put himself in a good position and they just fell away around him, it was a steering job which is fantastic - Mel Rowley, trainer of Masked Dance"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tends to race a bit too freely but is 2-6 over hurdles and may yet do better
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in novice company towards end of last year (2m6f/2m5f) and went very close on handicap debut at Ludlow (2m5f, good to soft) in February; slightly below that form last time and her tendency to race too freely remains a worry but she may yet have a bigger run in her.
Horse quote: 2024-10-31 at Stratford (22f): "Springs A Girl should've never been that price. We bought her after winning a bumper in Ireland and really liked her run at Cheltenham, when she stayed up the hill strongly to be midfield. My horses were sick when she ran at Catterick so we put a line through that. She hit the line strongly and there's more to come - Martin Keighley, trainer."
