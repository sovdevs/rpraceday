💬 Comment: Won two of his last three including when upped to 2m7f last time; 🔥 big player again
🔦 Spotlight: Won when upped to 2m4f at Uttoxeter (soft) in December on third handicap start and bounced back from Market Rasen fifth to score at Bangor (2m7f, heavy) in February; up another 6lb but he was strong at the finish last time and he should have more to offer at staying trips; key player.

🔦 Spotlight: Returned to hurdling with a win at Fakenham (2m5f, soft) in January and he ran to a similar level when runner-up there (2m5f, good) last month; needs to find something extra to get back on the scoresheet but he rallied well last time and looks worth another try at this trip; shortlisted.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who went close on handicap debut at Carlisle (2m3f, good to soft) in February but he didn't seem to get home over 3m1f at Carlisle (good; 7-4 favourite) two weeks ago; this is a less demanding test at this track but he needs to find more.

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 6yo and he could resume his progress at this new trip; in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Rallied to finish runner-up on handicap debut at Sedgefield (2m4f, good) last month; in the process of running to similar level when hampered and hitting the rail (immediately eased) over 2m6f at Stratford subsequently; still has potential after only six runs and he's in the mix at this new trip.

Horse quote: 2020-08-22 at Uttoxeter (16f): "She's couldn't put it together on the Flat. She's schooled really well at home, and today went round there with confidence and stayed all the way to the line. Topkapi Star has been a bit keen, but she had her eye on her hurdles and did her job. She looks small but doesn't ride anywhere near as small as she looks. Hopefully she'll continue to improve - Jack Quinlan, rider."

💬 Comment: Has not won since 2020 and has lots to prove back over hurdles after 304 days off
🔦 Spotlight: Six wins split between hurdling and chasing but last success was in 2020 and this veteran was out of sorts in only two runs last year; has lots to prove back over hurdles after 304 days off.
Horse quote: 2020-10-13 at Punchestown (24.5f): "He stayed on really well in the straight. They crawled the first mile and there wasn't much pace on but he did his job well. We take one day at a time and we'll see what's there for him in three or four weeks' time - trainer Sean McParlan."
