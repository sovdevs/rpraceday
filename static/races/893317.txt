💬 Comment: Beaten 15l over C&D last time off this mark and needs plenty of improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on sole point start and just a hint of promise in three maiden hurdles; a similar effort on handicap debut over C&D when beaten 15l off this mark by Crescent Moon; needs plenty of improvement but owner's retained rider is aboard.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a 2m Gowran maiden easily; a fine third on the Flat since; this trip is a question
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner can be a tricky customer but deservedly got off the mark over hurdles when winning a 2m Gowran maiden easily; a fine third on the Flat over 1m4f since; this trip is a question but a chance if staying.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Gowran Park (16f): "Whimsy finally got there. A big thanks has to go to Paddy Hanlon and Paddy Graffan the last day as if she had gotten away with it, she mightn't have started today.  I went down to the start to make sure. We wanted to make the running, but it didn't work out. Oakley [Brown, jockey] said she found another leg once she turned in. She loves that ground, so I was glad to see all the rain coming. It's brilliant to get over the line over hurdles and I thought the handicapper was a wee bit harsh putting her up 3lb for the last day, but I suppose I'll have to eat my words now. I didn't know what way she'd go being out the back but she enjoyed it Oakley said. We might get something at Fairyhouse for her and if the ground is heavy, it would be ideal - Anthony McCann, trainer."

💬 Comment: Solid in defeat the last thrice including over this trip; UK challenger should be involved
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner won a novice hurdle at Chepstow earlier in the season and has been solid in defeat the last thrice in similar company including over this trip; UK challenger should be involved.
Horse quote: 2024-10-11 at Chepstow (16f): "I was delighted with that. Ben Solo is a big baby and he's a really nice horse - he'll be a proper chaser next season. He'd been working well at home and he has a really good attitude. I thought two miles might have been short enough for him but he got away with it at a track like this. Ben [Jones] said he was green as grass so he should improve a lot from this - Rebecca Curtis, trainer."

💬 Comment: Capable of better now in handicaps and any market support would be significant
🔦 Spotlight: Point and bumper winner hasn't got close to that level over hurdles in four maidens up to this trip; is likely capable of better now in handicaps and any market support would be significant.
Horse quote: 2024-03-23 at Navan (15.5f): "Harbour Highway had shown plenty at home and Patrick [Mullins] had a sit on him on an away day. He was very keen to stick with him wherever he was going to run. He was impressive and galloped through the line, so hopefully he'll go on to bigger and better things. It's a few weeks to Punchestown and there is the winners' bumper there, and maybe even the champion bumper he could go to. We'll see how he comes out of this first - Emmet Mullins, trainer."
