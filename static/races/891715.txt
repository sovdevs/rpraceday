💬 Comment: Improved for tongue-tie at Market Rasen; may well build on that win
🔦 Spotlight: Improved for the fitting of tongue-tie (retained) in 2m3f event at Market Rasen last time and may well build on that win; shortlisted.
Horse quote: 2025-03-26 at Market Rasen (19f): "It was a nice performance. It's been an up-and-down season for Ostend. He ran very well in a very competitive race behind Jagwar at Bangor in November and we thought he'd have a big season in front of him, but it's been one thing after another. We're pleased to see the horse we thought we had. Better ground has been a big thing for him and he had a tongue-tie on today. I'm really pleased with him and the way he jumped. I'm going to keep him busy because he's missed time ? we might look at Ayr in a couple of weeks - Alastair Ralph, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jumped okay on chase debut but lacked fluency last time
🔦 Spotlight: Jumped okay when winning at Newcastle (chase debut) but lacked fluency when disappointing at Wetherby since; not sure what to expect.
Horse quote: 2025-02-22 at Newcastle (16.5f): "I'm really pleased. Bois Guillbert is made to jump fences and he's always jumped them better than he does hurdles when we've schooled him - Lucinda Russell, trainer."
