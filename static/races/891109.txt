💬 Comment: Progressed nicely at two; much stiffer task taking on elders but reportedly working well
🔦 Spotlight: Progressed nicely last year at two, winning Doncaster maiden and showed battling qualities to fend off challengers in Group 3 Staffordstown Stud Stakes over today's C&D (soft); Oaks entry faces much stiffer task taking on her elders here but reportedly working well.
Horse quote: 2024-10-22 at Curragh (8f): "Whirl just had that bit more experience and she got a lovely ride from Wayne. He went his pace and he was left alone to do it, and she was tough. She is another massive filly, these Wootton Bassetts are unbelievable - and they're just getting better - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

💬 Comment: Solid form at this level last year for Richard Spencer; bought for 475,000gns
🔦 Spotlight: Bought out of Richard Spencer's yard for 475,000gns at Tattersalls in December after a series of solid runs last year in stakes company at 1m-1m2f, mainly on a sound surface although ran to form on soft final start when third in Saint-Cloud Listed in October; can be keen.
Horse quote: 2023-07-15 at Newmarket (July) (7f): "Naomi Lapaglia was a breeze-up filly and we spent a long time last year getting her right mentally. She needs to settle, and the problem at Goodwood last time was she was too lit up. We always thought a mile would suit her and the more racing she has the better she'll be. Hopefully she'll be able to step back into black type races, although we don't have a plan as to where - Richard Spencer, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-10-13 at Naas (8f): "Azada ran a very good race in the Irish 1,000 Guineas and won well as a two-year-old. The nine and a half furlongs might have been a little too far for her last time at Gowran. She'd been working well and I thought she might be hard to beat today. She's a very big filly and there's a possibility she may be kept in training next year - Dermot Weld, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-07-30 at Galway (8.5f): "Mexicali Rose did it well and she will definitely improve for it. I rode her for a bit of luck and thankfully I got it - Wayne Hassett, rider."
