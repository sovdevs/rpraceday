🔦 Spotlight: Easily beat three rivals at Ayr (2m, good; first time hood) for Lucinda Russell a year ago, but poor in three starts for Dan Skelton after returning from seven months off in December; starts out for another 🆕 new yard (same owner) and interesting to see what the market says, having dropped 1lb below his last winning mark.
