🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Given too much to do when 6-4 for a 3m handicap at Leopardstown the last time
🔦 Spotlight: Winning hurdler who won twice over fences last season; sent off 6-4 favourite for a Leopardstown handicap hurdle last time and was given a bit too much to do; was only beaten 5l and this could be more his trip; respected.
Horse quote: 2024-01-11 at Clonmel (16f): "Money Heist has loads of scope and when I needed good jumps at the last two he came up for me. He travelled a lot easier here and at Naas. If the handicapper isn't too hard on him he could go in again - Keith Donoghue, rider."

💬 Comment: An 11-race maiden but has some competitive form in handicaps; may need good ground
🔦 Spotlight: An 11-race maiden but has some competitive form in handicaps and ran as though his latest race after a break would bring him on (first-time tongue-tie); seems to like goodish ground so the recent rain rather dampens enthusiasm.

💬 Comment: Bellewstown winner last week; now 9lb higher but has the wind in his sails
🔦 Spotlight: Won as a 2yo on the Flat (heavy); now getting it together over hurdles and he comfortably saw off six rivals at Bellewstown last week (2m1f, good); 9lb higher for this trickier assignment but has the wind in his sails.
Horse quote: 2022-09-07 at Cork (7f): "Imadpour did that well. He handled the ground well but probably got there a bit soon. He will improve with time - Ronan Whelan, rider"

💬 Comment: Looking good to go in again when taking a heavy late fall at Leopardstown the final time
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner and was looking good to go in again when taking a heavy late fall at Leopardstown the final time (2m4f, yielding); that was her second tumble on the trot but every chance provided her confidence hasn't been knocked.
Horse quote: 2024-10-12 at Fairyhouse (18.5f): "That was straightforward from Goodie Girl. I brought her here on Monday but brought her home as I thought the ground was a bit too quick for her. I walked the track the morning and I was happy with it. Patrick said that she travelled well, jumped well. She was a nice mare last year and hopefully she'll come on from the run - Dermot McLoughlin, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won his final hurdle race; 11lb higher now, though still 16lb beneath chase figure
🔦 Spotlight: Chasing in his last three races and did win his last hurdle start at Down Royal in December (2m1f, good to yielding; first-time blinkers), exploiting a much lower mark in this scene; 11lb higher now, though still 16lb beneath chase figure.
Horse quote: 2024-03-17 at Down Royal (19.5f): "St Denis's Well had a bad run the last day in Leopardstown, but it didn't suit as they hacked and he just stays all day. He's not ground dependent, he was just too weak to handle the soft. He has strengthened up now and he can handle it. Good horses will go on any ground - Ian Donoghue, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-12-15 at Navan (20.5f): "If anything Individualiste probably travelled a little too easily. I thought he got left there [in front] a little bit soon and he probably idled a little bit but when Charlie [O'Dwyer, rider of the runner-up] came to me I always felt like I was holding him. His confidence seems to be getting up and hopefully he can keep improving - Keith Donoghue, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

💬 Comment: 10lb higher than for his clearcut Gowran win; was back over fences last time
🔦 Spotlight: Back over fences last time and had previously won a big-field Gowran handicap hurdle by some 9l; however, that was off 10lb lower and this is a harder assignment.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Gowran Park (16f): "Battle Of Ridgeway looked the winner here the last day coming to the second-last the last day over fences. He just didn't get home after running with the choke out but he was way more relaxed today stepping back in trip. He's a real chaser but was always a moral to win a race over hurdles off his (12lb lower) mark. The boys wanted a runner today and it was the only suitable race so it's pot luck he's run over hurdles. We'll probably go back over fences as he's a natural chaser - Martin Hassett, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Exposed 11yo who runs well now and again but he's never the percentage play; no closer than 12l in three races since visored.
Horse quote: 2021-02-06 at Leopardstown (16f): "Drop The Anchor didn't wing all the hurdles so he had to be tough and he needs a test at the end of the race. He's not a big horse but really tough and he needed time. He's got it now - Pat Fahy, trainer"
