💬 Comment: Revitalised by return to hurdles, winning at Southwell and Kempton; may complete hat-trick
🔦 Spotlight: Has a poor completion record over fences this season but has been revitalised by a return to hurdling of late, winning at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) and Kempton (2m, good), well handled by Lewis Stones each time; escapes a penalty for Tuesday's success and could complete a hat-trick.
