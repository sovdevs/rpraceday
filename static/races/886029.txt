üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: One of his strong stable's main contenders after impressing at Navan a month ago
üî¶ Spotlight: Made his debut only a month ago but was hugely impressive at Navan (soft to heavy) in comfortably disposing of experienced opposition (who had shown plenty of ability) by a widening 5l, and so strong was he through the line that Patrick Mullins had a job pulling him up; that performance was evidently not unexpected after going off favourite (9-4) and the vibes emanating out of a yard that's farmed this race bode well; given that ten winners of this contest had raced only once, there's no knocking inexperience.

üí¨ Comment: Well regarded by his top yard and couldn't have been more impressive at Punchestown
üî¶ Spotlight: Competitive when falling in his first point and comfortably made amends in the second; rules debut only 20 days ago but he was the talk of Punchestown (soft; 8-15) and duly eased clear with Patrick Mullins (who now rides Copacabana) having to be only a passenger; the could-be-anything tag definitely applies here and Willie Mullins speaks of him with a glint in his eye; huge player.

üí¨ Comment: Powered away from a solid yardstick in a Grade 2 for mares; females have won this
üî¶ Spotlight: Point and dual bumper winner (all on soft); seemingly neglected by Patrick Mullins (who rode her the time before) in a Grade 2 for mares at Leopardstown's big February festival but, under Jody Townend who retains the ride here, the turbo kicked in up the straight and she powered away from a solid yardstick who won last Sunday; clearly has an engine and two mares armed with the handy sex allowance have won this in the last decade, including the stable's Relegate who took the same Leopardstown race en route.

üî¶ Spotlight: Odds-on when winning his British point (3m, soft) by 23l and subsequently sold for ¬£160,000; described as "big and backward" by his trainer in the Racing Post's early-season Stable Tours but he looked good in brushing aside a well-regarded Skelton horse at Warwick on New Year's Eve (soft); rightly considered to be one of Britain's best chances; Paul Nicholls has had horses placed in this race but never won it.

üî¶ Spotlight: Recruited for 200,000euros after winning an Irish maiden point (3m, yielding) last April; won easily at Newbury (good) but the next two home haven't done anything for the form and he has a mountain to climb on the all figures; on the plus side, he's well thought of and reportedly impressed in a gallop last week.

üî¶ Spotlight: Has a Festival winner in the family as his dam is a half-sister to Master Minded who won the Champion Chase twice; long odds-on when doing it easily at Navan and was then ‚úÇÔ∏è gelded; held his own when third in a Grade 2 at Leopardstown's Dublin Racing Festival (again on soft; unraced on drier ground) and that was against rivals armed with more experience, including Sortudo who was second; nice prospect but may lack the finishing kick for this.

üî¶ Spotlight: Only one 4yo (Cue Card) has won this race since 1995; this one is well related but has been absent since December when edging out a subsequent winning hurdler at Bangor (soft); that bare form leaves him with a whopping amount to find on this seismic rise in class.
