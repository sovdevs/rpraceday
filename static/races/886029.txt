🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: One of his strong stable's main contenders after impressing at Navan a month ago
🔦 Spotlight: Made his debut only a month ago but was hugely impressive at Navan (soft to heavy) in comfortably disposing of experienced opposition (who had shown plenty of ability) by a widening 5l, and so strong was he through the line that Patrick Mullins had a job pulling him up; that performance was evidently not unexpected after going off favourite (9-4) and the vibes emanating out of a yard that's farmed this race bode well; given that ten winners of this contest had raced only once, there's no knocking inexperience.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well regarded by his top yard and couldn't have been more impressive at Punchestown
🔦 Spotlight: Competitive when falling in his first point and comfortably made amends in the second; rules debut only 20 days ago but he was the talk of Punchestown (soft; 8-15) and duly eased clear with Patrick Mullins (who now rides Copacabana) having to be only a passenger; the could-be-anything tag definitely applies here and Willie Mullins speaks of him with a glint in his eye; huge player.

🔦 Spotlight: Won his point over 2m4f in Britain last April and five days later fetched £85,000 at the sales; has impressed in both his bumpers in Ireland, unextended at Punchestown (soft) and Navan (Listed; yielding to soft); quickened smartly the last time and the Topspeed figure was eyecatching; could possess the required blend of speed and stamina for this test and there's no knowing where his limitations lie; powerful owners have never won this but they're getting closer (third 12 months ago); lots to like.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Powered away from a solid yardstick in a Grade 2 for mares; females have won this
🔦 Spotlight: Point and dual bumper winner (all on soft); seemingly neglected by Patrick Mullins (who rode her the time before) in a Grade 2 for mares at Leopardstown's big February festival but, under Jody Townend who retains the ride here, the turbo kicked in up the straight and she powered away from a solid yardstick who won last Sunday; clearly has an engine and two mares armed with the handy sex allowance have won this in the last decade, including the stable's Relegate who took the same Leopardstown race en route.

🔦 Spotlight: Odds-on when winning his British point (3m, soft) by 23l and subsequently sold for £160,000; described as "big and backward" by his trainer in the Racing Post's early-season Stable Tours but he looked good in brushing aside a well-regarded Skelton horse at Warwick on New Year's Eve (soft); rightly considered to be one of Britain's best chances; Paul Nicholls has had horses placed in this race but never won it.

🔦 Spotlight: Recruited for 200,000euros after winning an Irish maiden point (3m, yielding) last April; won easily at Newbury (good) but the next two home haven't done anything for the form and he has a mountain to climb on the all figures; on the plus side, he's well thought of and reportedly impressed in a gallop last week.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course Listed winner; forget last time as he pulled too hard off tepid fractions
🔦 Spotlight: It wasn't a strong Listed race that he won here in November (good; coped with softer in points) but he had loads more in hand than the narrow margin would suggest; turned over since at odds-on at Huntingdon but a blind eye can be turned to that as he was far too gassy off tepid fractions; could be seen in a different light here should they crack on at a solid pace and top trainer has been talking up his chances.

🔦 Spotlight: The dam is out of a half-sister to Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere; all out to win on heavy at Newton Abbot in October but had the runner-up further behind when decisively following up in Berkshire Winter Million event at Windsor in January (soft); impressing on typical mid-winter ground can count for nothing here but he's hugely 🔍 unexposed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has a solid profile but it's likely that he lacks the same star potential of some in here
🔦 Spotlight: Seemingly down his stable's pecking order but he's been bang there at Leopardstown (good to yielding/soft) in his last two runs, the latest a Grade 2 when finishing alongside He Can't Dance; he may lack the same star potential of some in here.
