🔦 Spotlight: Dual C&D winner who recorded his fifth AW win when landing a classified event at Chelmsford 18 days ago; 2lb higher back in a handicap but he showed a good attitude to defy a high draw last time and has stall one on this return to Tapeta; key player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Held in bid for a four-timer here last week but things didn't go her way; dangerous
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick when dead-heating in classified event over C&D last month; no impact back in a handicap last week but she missed the break and things didn't go her way against a pace bias; remains well treated on old form and has claims if things go more to plan this time.
