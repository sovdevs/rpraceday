🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won narrowly over C&D in November, but form not worked out; vulnerable under penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Built on his promising third of ten on his Kempton debut (7f, Polytrack) in October when scoring by a head over this C&D the following month; the form of that race hasn't worked out, though, and although being proven under the conditions must count for something he looks vulnerable under his penalty.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won narrowly over C&D in November, but form not worked out; vulnerable under penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Built on his promising third of ten on his Kempton debut (7f, Polytrack) in October when scoring by a head over this C&D the following month; the form of that race hasn't worked out, though, and although being proven under the conditions must count for something he looks vulnerable under his penalty.
