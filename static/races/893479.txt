🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Slowly away again but showed good attitude to win claimer here last week; can go well
🔦 Spotlight: Had been regressing prior to surprise 40-1 Dundalk win in 7f claimer last month for Cormac Farrell; blew the start on debut for this yard at Bellewstown; slowly away again but showed willing attitude to win claimer here (1m, soft) last week; entitled to go well.
Horse quote: 2025-04-16 at Gowran Park (8f): "Weegeebear actually jumped slow and I went to plan B straightaway, down the rail. I was able to scoot up their inside turning the bend and got a really nice position. He travelled into the straight really well and quickened up. He's hit the line strong. He had been slowly away at Bellewstown last time. When you jump slow around Bellewstown it's hard to get into it, we struggled all the way really. I'm glad he's gone and done it today - Adam Caffrey, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved on testing ground when winning on return at Naas (5f), best work at the finish
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't show much in five starts last year at 6f-1m on good or quicker ground; improved massively on testing ground on final run for Mick Mulvany when winning on return at Naas (5f, soft to heavy), doing best work at the finish; 8lb higher but big chance up in trip for 🆕 new yard.
Horse quote: 2025-03-23 at Naas (5f): "I thought the trip might be on the sharp side for Dance For Chester but he handled the give in the ground. He finished off his race well and I'm not sure where we go from here - Mick Mulvany, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't seem to stay the trip when fifth behind Dance For Chester at Naas last month
🔦 Spotlight: Triple-figure odds all four maidens and ran accordingly; some promise on handicap debut at Dundalk (5f) but didn't seem to stay the trip when fifth behind Dance For Chester at Naas last month; needs to find more.

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden after 11 turf starts but well treated judged on third at Galway (7f, soft) last summer off 61 and was sent off favourite when running a dismal race behind Dance For Chester at Naas before tailing off at Dundalk; too early to write him off.
