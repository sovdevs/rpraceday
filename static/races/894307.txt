🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second to Doddiethegreat in the Pertemps Final; should again be very competitive
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2-winning novice whose chase career was aborted after one run; solid form in three handicap hurdles since then, last time coming out second best in a ding-dong battle with stablemate Doddiethegreat in the 3m Pertemps Final at Cheltenham (good to soft; first-time cheekpieces); no reason why he won't be very competitive again.
Horse quote: 2024-11-10 at Sandown (15.5f): "Jeriko Du Reponet is a very good horse and I really believed he'd canter round today and we'd be talking about coming back here the Henry VIII but I don't think we'll do that for the time being. We've got to go away and regroup. We can always get surprised and fooled, and I'm afraid the horse has done that to us today in every sense. He's 100 per cent and pulled up completely sound. I just think it's a bizarre chapter of circumstances that have contributed to this. I'm sorry, but no one is going to be more disappointed than our team. We've got to correct it and we will - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-10-04 at Gowran Park (20f): "Park Of Kings jumped well and won well enough. He's only six and we'll look for something similar. I wouldn't like the ground to deteriorate too much. He wears a tongue-tie for a reason - Paul Nolan, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has clicked in a big way with Brian Hughes on his last two starts (cheekpieces applied), following his second to One Big Bang at Haydock with a gutsy win over Jeriko Du Reponet in the Pertemps Final (3m; tongue-tie added for first time); lightly raced for a 9yo and not fully exposed just yet.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (24f): "Nico [De Boinville, jockey] said make sure Doddiethegreat has loads of light, which is a little bit alien to me as I like to be glued to the inner. He got in a good old rhythm, I was just following Sean Flanagan everywhere. I missed the second last and I was getting there sooner than I wanted, but I had a willing partner - Brian Hughes, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-12-07 at Navan (25f): "This is a great pot to win. I've had some good winners, a couple of Grade 3s, but this is the biggest pot I've won. It worked out perfectly. Aidan [Kelly] gave Flicker Of Hope  a brilliant ride, he knows him well. He's a chaser in the making. I don't think he'll go again at Christmas, we might wait for the Dublin Racing Festival - Mark Fahey, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won four of his previous seven starts before failing to give his running in Pertemps Final
🔦 Spotlight: Barely sighted when only 8-1 for the Pertemps Final but had won four of his previous seven over hurdles including a qualifier for that race at Leopardstown; finds himself 10lb higher but likely that he has more in the locker.
Horse quote: 2024-10-24 at Clonmel (19.5f): "The ground went against Win Some Lose Some the last day at Listowel, he hated it. These were ideal conditions. We went no gallop and it turned into a sprint. He takes time to warm into it, but he sparked up going down to the second-last. He's a good-ground horse - Mark Walsh, jockey."

💬 Comment: Won a Pertemps Qualifier before running well in the Final; Sean Bowen now takes over
🔦 Spotlight: Career-best to beat Doddiethegreat in a Pertemps Qualifier at Haydock (3m1f, good to soft) and didn't run at all badly in the Final; couldn't dismiss with Sean Bowen taking over for the first time.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Haydock (24.5f): "One Big Bang has done it nicely and we might be looking at Cheltenham now. This is the first time he's run on a bit better ground and he likes it here. There's a race at Uttoxeter on the Saturday after the festival, but we'll think about Cheltenham. He ran poorly at Ffos Las last time, but it was probably a bit too soon after Cheltenham. He's only seven so there's a lot more fun to be had with him and I think he'll be a better chaser in the future - Oliver Wright, syndicate manager of Big Bang Racing, owners."

💬 Comment: Raced freely over 2m4f latest; will need to give himself a chance of staying this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced novice who ran well at Ayr despite getting turned over at long odds-on in a three-runner race (winner very capable); did race with the choke out and that was over 2m4f, so will need to give himself a chance of staying this new trip.
Horse quote: 2025-01-23 at Wetherby (16f): "Chart Topper is a fantastic jumper, he's so measured. Once upon a time we thought he might be a Cheltenham horse. He got a setback and took a while to get the hang of it again but going jumping seems to have unlocked the potential we always thought he had.   As a bumper horse we thought he'd be a 140-plus horse, his first hurdles performance could have been that and that looks like it could have been that. He could go to the spring festivals but we'll probably keep him going in the summer and he could be a Galway and Listowel horse - Patrick Mullins, jockey."

💬 Comment: More of a chaser these days but a capable hurdler and potentially very well handicapped
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 2m5f Listed handicap chase at Leopardstown in March (yielding) off a 10lb higher mark and never gave his running in a 3m Grade 3 last time; has to be of interest off this figure returned to hurdling and he did beat Spillane's Tower in a novice two years ago.
Horse quote: 2025-03-02 at Leopardstown (21.5f): "Monbeg Park is a bit quirky. The last day, he ran well, finishing third and swished his tail a bit. I was talking to the boys, who are point-to-pointing today, and they said leave your stick until last resort and try not to interfere with him too much. He has loads of ability - Tiernen Power Roche, jockey."

💬 Comment: Could be sharper for his Ayr run but JJ Slevin seemingly prefers C'Est Ta Chance
🔦 Spotlight: Strike-rate of 4-11 and 3-9 as a hurdler; stuck on well for third over 2m5f at Ayr and that was after 305 days away; could be sharper for that but JJ Slevin seemingly prefers C'Est Ta Chance.
Horse quote: 2024-03-23 at Newbury (19f): "I was worried mid-race we'd brought I Love My Baie back in trip too much. He's a three miler, but bombed last time, although it wasn't the trip - he just didn't run well. We've given him time to get over that and he's quite a nice horse; he was third in a Listed race at Haydock in November - Anthony Bromley, racing manager for Simon Munir and Isaac Souede."

🔦 Spotlight: For an 11yo he ran a cracker to be seventh in the Coral Cup but then finished well behind at Aintree; not hard to look elsewhere.
Horse quote: 2024-11-02 at Wetherby (24f): "Beacon Edge is a lovely genuine horse, he runs his race every time and I couldn't have been more happy with the way he did it there.  Small-runner fields can get quite tactical, we picked it up turning into the straight and I didn't want to be too far away because I knew my lad stays. He's done it well - Danny Gilligan, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Has returned from a long absence in good form, last time beating all bar a 📈 progressive youngster at Kempton (2m5f, good to soft); does have a bit to prove over this far and vulnerable to rivals less exposed.
Horse quote: 2022-05-02 at Kempton (20.5f): "It's well documented that Stoner's Choice is not the best jumper over hurdles but Max has always schooled him over hurdles and we always hoped he would respect a fence. He made one novice mistake down the back but other than that he was foot perfect. Max said he was idling a little in front. He's done the job lovely today and Max has given him a beautiful ride. It's important he goes right-handed but we'll have a look as we're limited this time of year. He loves the ground, so it would be a shame to put him away - Fergal O'Brien, trainer"

Horse quote: 2023-04-19 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "The Friday Man is only a novice for a little while so we said we'd take our chance. He'll go jumping fences now and he's not a bad horse. He'll be a nice chaser - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Ran okay to be beaten about 10l at Aintree (behind Park Of Kings) and that was after a lengthy break; however, he's an exposed dual-purpose performer and others are more intriguing.
Horse quote: 2022-05-06 at Downpatrick (22f): "Building Bridges was going well at home. He's never went from the front for us, we always thought he was too keen. Today we said we'd give it a rattle and it worked a treat - Oran McGill, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Didn't take to fences and was pulled up on his return to hurdling in a 3m handicap at Gowran in October; has won four times in this discipline but this is a tough race in which to rediscover his form.
Horse quote: 2023-08-05 at Galway (22.5f): "Ambitious Fellow lost his form and there was an issue with him after he ran at Limerick last year, but he looks back to himself now. I was worried about the ground but it worked out great - Peter Fahey, trainer."
