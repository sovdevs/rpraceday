🔦 Spotlight: Has speed to burn and would appeal as the likeliest leader in a race stacked with prominent racers; may defy this mark at some point but this is his first run at Wolverhampton and he could help tee it up for a finisher.

🌱 Breeder: Maurice Burns
🏠 Owner: Rp Racing Ltd
💬 Comment: Running well in defeat on AW this winter, most recently over C&D; wide stall to overcome
🔦 Spotlight: Series of good runs in defeat this winter, finding only a resurgent Kylian too strong over C&D two weeks ago; this is a lower grade but it's competitive and he has the outside stall to negotiate.

💬 Comment: Running well in defeat on AW this winter, most recently over C&D; wide stall to overcome
🔦 Spotlight: Series of good runs in defeat this winter, finding only a resurgent Kylian too strong over C&D two weeks ago; this is a lower grade but it's competitive and he has the outside stall to negotiate.
