🔦 Spotlight: The last four of his five wins under rules were at Exeter, including two in a row early last year; started this season with echoes of that and is now 2lb below his last winning mark; had blinkers first time on latest start (not disgraced) and they are retained; considered back down in class and back at Exeter.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point to prove after last two runs (one Flat) for A King and one recently for current yard
🔦 Spotlight: Took well to hurdling as a juvenile for Fergal O'Brien last season but has a point to prove following his last two starts (one Flat) for Alan King and one recently for current yard; has nearly always worn cheekpieces and also tongue tied on latest start, but neither of them today.
