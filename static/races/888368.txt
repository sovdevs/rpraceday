🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat a 📈 progressive runner-up at Newcastle last month and a 3lb rise could prove lenient
🔦 Spotlight: His jumping has lacked fluency but he made it 2-4 over fences when getting up close home at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft) last month, coming clear with a 📈 progressive runner-up; walked over at Haydock on Wednesday; 🚀 open to further improvement and a 3lb rise for Newcastle could prove lenient.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Short-headed at Musselburgh last month and the first and third have both won since
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who is nothing like the force of old and is without a win since June 2022, but he seems to have found his current level judged on his near-miss at Musselburgh (2m7f, good to soft) last month; the first/third have both won since and this drop back in trip may be a plus; could be in the mix provided the absence of his usual tongue-tie isn't an issue.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His four wins have come at Ayr but he's capable of running well elsewhere; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: His four wins have come at Ayr and he was somewhat underwhelming there a fortnight ago; however, he bumped into a highly 📈 progressive winner when runner-up there two starts ago and he is capable of running well elsewhere (good third at Newcastle in November); not ruled out.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran his best race yet over fences when going close at Hexham (2m4f, good to soft) recently; however, from out of the handicap he's 8lb higher today and needs to find something extra in first-time cheekpieces.
