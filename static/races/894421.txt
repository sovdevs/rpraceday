💬 Comment: Did well in adverse circumstances last time, second to Fountain House puts him in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: 2-10 in points; ran a fine race to finish 4l second to Fountain House on his rules' debut at Thurles in March; backed that up in adverse circumstances at Downpatrick, was still well off the pace three out and then his rider had to cope with a slipped saddle and a lost iron early on the long-run-in; horse and rider did well in the circumstances.

🔦 Spotlight: Sole win under rules came at 25-1 in this race two years ago; inconsistent in handicap chases in a low grade, but capable of the odd good performance, such as when second at Ballinrobe last September and fourth at this venue in November; last of five finishers in this last season.
