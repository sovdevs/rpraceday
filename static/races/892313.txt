💬 Comment: Productive winter on AW; stayed on well over this trip to score latest; up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Has enjoyed a productive winter on AW, winning three times at Dundalk since November and best run for a while when staying on well over this trip at Dundalk to score by half a length latest; on his highest mark for some time but still feasibly treated on old form and he arrives in better form than most of his rivals here.

🔦 Spotlight: Hit crossbar in 5f Tipperary maiden last summer but not at the same level in three maidens since; first-time blinkers need to have dramatic effect for him to get off the mark on handicap debut.
