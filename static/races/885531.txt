💬 Comment: Improved AW form when making all over C&D latest; 4lb rise not too harsh; good shot
🔦 Spotlight: Two turf wins in 2024; had no striking AW record previously (never involved behind Crafter at Lingfield in November) but he benefited from front-running tactics over C&D 14 days ago and a 4lb rise shouldn't be beyond him; can give it a good shot.

💬 Comment: 11lb lower than last winning mark; back to form behind Meet Me In Meraki over C&D latest
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins at about 1m in early 2024, at Newcastle and on this track, but struggled a bit with some trip switches until running much better behind Meet Me In Meraki over C&D a fortnight ago; runs off the same mark, 11lb lower than his latest winning one, so good weights chance.

💬 Comment: Improved AW form when making all over C&D latest; 4lb rise not too harsh; good shot
🔦 Spotlight: Two turf wins in 2024; had no striking AW record previously (never involved behind Crafter at Lingfield in November) but he benefited from front-running tactics over C&D 14 days ago and a 4lb rise shouldn't be beyond him; can give it a good shot.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins at about 1m in early 2024, at Newcastle and on this track, but struggled a bit with some trip switches until running much better behind Meet Me In Meraki over C&D a fortnight ago; runs off the same mark, 11lb lower than his latest winning one, so good weights chance.

💬 Comment: Won four on turf in 2024, at 1m2f and 1m1f; needs improvement on AW handicap form
🔦 Spotlight: Had an excellent turf season in 2024, winning four at 1m2f and 1m1f; however, he was pulled up  on hurdle debut since and his AW handicap form, including over 1m at Kempton recently, falls short of what will be needed here.
