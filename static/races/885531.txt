💬 Comment: Improved AW form when making all over C&D latest; 4lb rise not too harsh; good shot
🔦 Spotlight: Two turf wins in 2024; had no striking AW record previously (never involved behind Crafter at Lingfield in November) but he benefited from front-running tactics over C&D 14 days ago and a 4lb rise shouldn't be beyond him; can give it a good shot.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins at about 1m in early 2024, at Newcastle and on this track, but struggled a bit with some trip switches until running much better behind Meet Me In Meraki over C&D a fortnight ago; runs off the same mark, 11lb lower than his latest winning one, so good weights chance.

💬 Comment: Sole win as 2yo in France; good spell before Christmas; down the field latest; new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win as a 2yo in France; has dropped a long way in the weights since last spring but a better spell before Christmas didn't last and he now races beyond an extended 1m for the first time.

🔦 Spotlight: Two turf wins in 2024; had no striking AW record previously (never involved behind Crafter at Lingfield in November) but he benefited from front-running tactics over C&D 14 days ago and a 4lb rise shouldn't be beyond him; can give it a good shot.
