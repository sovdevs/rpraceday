🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up on his debut over C&D in December and filled the same position having gone well clear on his Kempton return (1m, Polytrack) this month; a couple of those behind last time have already won since and he has a fine chance to go one better.

💬 Comment: Never competitive after a slow start on last October's Yarmouth debut; can do better
🔦 Spotlight: Just 3-1 but never got competitive following a slow start when in midfield on his Yarmouth debut (7f, soft) last October; it's likely there is better to come from him and the stable won this last year.
