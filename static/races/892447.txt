🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fine run at Naas earlier this month; should go close today with any improvement from that
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner has run respectably in two maiden hurdles, the latest after a break at Naas earlier this month; should go close today with any improvement from that.
Horse quote: 2022-09-24 at Curragh (6f): "I fancied Mile End in Down Royal the last day but she was drawn 11, missed the kick and never got into the race. Ben [Coen] said he was forced wide all the way, stayed on well and probably wants a mile, but I worked her in blinkers the other day, gave her a sharpener, and they seemed to have brought her alive. It looked like a winnable nursery. She got out there in front, flowing along, and Ben said she did it well - Johnny Murtagh, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-07-27 at Gowran Park (9.5f): "Mayo For Sam just can't seem to win in Mayo! A mile and two is probably her trip. We couldn't get her into Galway so we came here and it's after working out great. There's a lot of fun to be had with her and she'll jump a hurdle - Ado McGuiness, trainer."
