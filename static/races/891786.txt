🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive record includes a good second in this race last year; top on ratings
🔦 Spotlight: Good second in this contest last year then went one better in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown (1m2f) later in April, taking overall record to 211121; absent since; top on ratings and 📈 progressive to boot.
Horse quote: 2024-04-26 at Sandown (10f): "We're very happy with that as it was the first time Okeechobee has really had to get his head down and race. He doesn't have many miles on the clock and we could look at supplementing him into the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp next month as we think the race will suit him - Barry Mahon, racing manager to Juddmonte."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Record of 121 on AW includes a success in last year's Winter Derby; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Has a record of 121 on AW, the wins in the 2023 Derby Trial at Lingfield (1m4f) and 2024 Winter Derby at Southwell (1m3f); strong contender, assuming he returns from 379-day absence in top form.
Horse quote: 2024-02-24 at Southwell (AW) (11f): "Military Order was a bit cute last time, so Charlie [Appleby, trainer] said to run him quiet off the bend and he came back strong. It's a nice prize to win and it's nice that he's stepped up on his form in the trial. He's always been a talented horse and could go back to a mile and a half easily - Danny Tudhope, jockey."

💬 Comment: Finished third in this race last year; overall form figures at Kempton read 1132
🔦 Spotlight: Beat all bar subsequent Group 1 winner Kalpana when last seen, taking his Kempton form figures to 1132; ✂️ gelded since; Listed scorer in 2023 and finished third in this contest 12 months ago; solid chance.
Horse quote: 2023-11-06 at Kempton (AW) (12f): "We didn't go overly quick, but I was happy with the way Lion's Pride jumped up two gears really quickly at the bottom of the straight. He won the race there and was still strong at the line. We've always thought a lot of him and he's had excuses for when he's been beaten. He had good horses like Middle Earth behind him when he won here before, so he's a nice horse - Rab Havlin, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Showed very useful form over 1m2f in notable handicaps at York (won/second) and Listed event at Goodwood (went very close) last term; interesting returned to this trip with 1m reappearance under his belt.
Horse quote: 2024-05-17 at York (10.5f): "Botanical was in super nick today. The worry was the drying ground as he was so dominant on quite soft ground at Hamilton, but he showed he copes with it. He was pretty dominant there and while he'll get a bit of a clobbering for that, he's a smart horse - James Doyle, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Ties in with Botanical on reappearance form; has scored only once in last 18 turf runs but looks interesting belatedly returned to AW, being 2-2 in this sphere (first two career starts, including Listed win).
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Newmarket (10f): "Checkandchallenge has run in some hot races this year and I don't think he has actually run a bad race in any of them. Dropping back into a Listed race today it was just nice to get his head back in front. I know the distance between them was a long way at Ascot the other day, but he was fourth in a Group One and he picked up a good bit of prize money and he had some nice horses behind him. I think a mile and a quarter is right for him. We went back for the stiff mile at Ascot as we felt on that track it was going to suit him and he got his just rewards. He can cope with those extremes out there today where a lot of other horses can't. He is in the Hong Kong Mile, but I think he deserves a nice break. There will be plenty of options for him next year. Horses like him can turn up in those Group One races that cut up a bit and pick up a bit of money. We might also look at those Group Three and Group Two races in France again next year - William Knight, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rosebery win took his Kempton record to 3-4; respected kept to this venue
🔦 Spotlight: Justified favouritism in the Rosebery (1m3f handicap) on seasonal debut, taking Kempton record to 3-4 and AW score to 4-9; faces stiffer task on these terms but warrants some respect kept to this course.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Kempton (AW) (11f): "The pace was on early and I was happy to bide my time. Teumessias Fox is a quality horse when things click for him. We don't always know when he's going to perform, but it's great he can compete in these big pots for King Power. He's a fun dude. He loves it round here but he can also perform on turf - Oisin Murphy, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Absent since running well at Royal Ascot in 2023; 🆕 new yard; market helpful
🔦 Spotlight: Absent since running very well in 1m2f Group 3 at Royal Ascot in 2023 (final start for Roger Varian); ✂️ gelded later that year and sold for 18,000gns last October; betting may prove instructive.
Horse quote: 2022-09-17 at Newbury (7f): "Exoplanet is lovely. The plan was always to come here and get him started. He's a nice horse that has looked the part at home, especially in the past couple of weeks when the recent rain helped us get him onto the grass. He's strengthened into his frame over the last two or three weeks and I thought David gave him a lovely ride. He moved through the race nicely and finished well under pressure. He could be put away now, but we will see - Roger Varian, trainer."
