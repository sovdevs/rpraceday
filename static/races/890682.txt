🔦 Spotlight: Front-running filly who has a respectable strike-rate over 6f and ran creditably last time when bidding for a Kempton hat-trick; remains in good form but doesn't appear to be crying out for this new trip.
Horse quote: 2024-02-15 at Chelmsford (AW) (6f): "We jumped a little bit awkward, I think we got a bit of a bump, but we got to the front quite easy. Shallow was looking at everything and we got a nice easy lead. When I asked her to quicken, she did it really nicely - Darragh Keenan, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2024-09-02 at Chepstow (8f): "Sean gave Delicacy a really sympathetic ride and said she was always in his hands and going well. She's in the sales and I suppose she'll still go as there isn't a race for her before then - Rolf Johnson, owners' representative."

Horse quote: 2024-03-29 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "I said to Cliff just before the race that I was dying for a jockey to give me a heart attack, to come so late I nearly have to go into A & E afterwards and he executed it perfectly with a peach of a ride. He gave Cloud Cover the best ride she's had. The hood also helped, the straight seven furlongs was more of a stamina test so it was crucial she settled. For a filly with her sort of rating you want black type and there's a mile fillies' Listed race at Kempton next Saturday, but that will probably come a bit soon - James Tate, trainer."
