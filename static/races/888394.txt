🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five wins over C&D including in her last two starts; off same mark as last time; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins over C&D including in her last two starts; escapes a penalty for her success in an apprentice handicap eight days ago and although she has a bit to find with Enzos Angel on last month's meeting, she is still a contender in her current mood.
