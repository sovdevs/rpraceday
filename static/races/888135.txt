🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**

🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard; 2-7 over hurdles, including a maiden here, and rated 132; was running a nice race when falling at the last in a better race than this on his chase debut at Fairyhouse; lesser effort in a novice handicap chase at Ayr on latest; capable of better and could go well stepped up in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Highly tried after maiden hurdle win, decent effort on chase debut, can't discount
🔦 Spotlight: Third runner for yard; highly tried to no avail after winning a maiden hurdle at Thurles on his first start for this yard in November 2023; shaped with promise on his chase debut after a 261 day break at Naas in December when fourth of 12, 7.5l behind Blizzard Of Oz; should improve for that and not discounted.
