💬 Comment: Went close in a heavy-ground bumper and third in a 1m3f Southwell AW maiden; needs better
🔦 Spotlight: Went close in a heavy-ground bumper last March and showed some ability switched to the Flat at Southwell (1m3f, AW) in July/September, staying-on third last time; better is surely needed and this shorter trip may not help.
