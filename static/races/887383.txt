🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Denied a fourth 2m AW win of the winter by the stewards last time; sure to go well
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 5yo who has thrived on Tapeta this winter, scoring three times at around 2m; it was only wayward tendencies which cost him another win at Wolverhampton last time (first past post but demoted to second) and he looks sure to go well again.

🔦 Spotlight: Creditable front-running second over 12.5f here on reappearance and may not have been helped by racing alone against the far rail (main action near rail) when only seventh back here (12.5f again) since; treated as if still in form and the step back up in trip is a help if anything for this former C&D winner.

📝 Comment: in rear, steady headway from 5th, still plenty to do when left in modest third 3 out, went second 2 out, stayed on approaching last, too much to do (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said that his instructions were to drop in and settle, get jumping to finish his race as gelding previously made the running and failed to get home; having jumped the 1st, he felt the front runners had gone too quick and felt it prudent not to chase the strong pace; from after 2nd in back straight he began to niggle and squeeze along having lost ground after being slightly inconvenienced by Bold Jury running out, and being cautious to the fact they were still a long way from home; turning into home straight he asked for more of an effort, passing tiring horses; he felt that after Beau Quali had fallen at 3rd last, it had left the winner alone and idling in front, which allowed his gelding to gain more lengths. adding that gelding had achieved best possible placing' he reported to trainer that gelding may benefit from a step up in trip; trainers' rep was satisfied with ride; explanations were noted)
