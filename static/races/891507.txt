💬 Comment: Much improved to win at Wolverhampton; dangerously 🔍 unexposed handicap debutant
🔦 Spotlight: 135,000gns breeze-up buy who appeared to get stuck in the mud in his only run at two; back from a break to win narrowly at Wolverhampton (7f; always prominent) and the clear second seems well regarded; dangerously 🔍 unexposed handicap debutant.

💬 Comment: Only 8th of 10 on hcap debut at the Craven meeting but didn't handle the track
🔦 Spotlight: 33-1 debut winner (1m, good; Arbitration fifth) and the ground was heavy here next time (fifth of six at odds of 4-9); didn't appear to handle Newmarket's undulations too well when only eighth of ten on handicap debut at the Craven meeting (1m, good); remains relatively 🔍 unexposed.
