🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sets the standard on her promising run at Ascot and yard was 42% with 3yos here last year
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't live up to market expectations on Kempton debut in December; reappeared with fifth of six at Ascot (1m, good to firm) last month but was only beaten around 2l in that useful contest and she sets the standard on that promising effort; key player for yard that had a 42% record with 3yos here last year.

💬 Comment: Never involved when 10-11 at Southwell but she's a likely 🚀 improver on this step up to 1m
🔦 Spotlight: 400,000euros yearling; never involved when 10-11 favourite at Southwell (7f, Tapeta) last month but that was behind a useful rival and she made some encouraging late headway; should know much more this time and it wouldn't be a surprise if she took a major step forward upped in trip.
