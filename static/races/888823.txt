🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent C&D second was much-improved; 3lb rise seems fair and could prove the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner but little of note hurdling until much-improved over C&D 17 days ago when only worn down close home (well clear of remainder) by a well-backed rival; 3lb rise seems fair and could prove the one to beat.

💬 Comment: Ex Gavin Cromwell-trained 6yo; absent since last May and opening mark on the high side
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced for Gavin Cromwell, contesting some decent maidens and on final start for the yard tame enough finishing effort when third in Ballinrobe maiden in May on quicker ground; back from a break for 🆕 new yard and tongue-tie tried; opening mark looks plenty.
