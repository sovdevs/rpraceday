🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Eyecatching effort over C&D three weeks ago; not sure to back it up but well handicapped
🔦 Spotlight: Went the wrong way for Hughie Morrison and he made an inauspicious start over hurdles for this yard in December (made a respiratory noise); much more to like about his third over C&D three weeks ago, however, finishing strongly from the rear despite meeting some trouble; wouldn't be sure to back it up but he has plenty of handicapping scope.
