🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wincanton winner (1m7f); pleasing second at Windsor (Class 2) since; strong contender.
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runs; point and bumper winner who carries a penalty for winning a similar mares' novice at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) on Boxing Day; a subsequent second to a Paul Nicholls-trained winner in a Class 2 at Windsor (with Siog Geal fourth) was her best effort yet; strong contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Penalised; closely matched with Bluey on subsequent Windsor (Class 2) form.
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; showed a good level of ability in bumpers and saw off a subsequent winner on hurdles debut at Catterick (2m, good; 4-9 favourite); fourth, but only 1l behind Bluey, when raised in grade at Windsor since; has every chance of turning the tables with that one.

💬 Comment: Low-key comeback in Warwick bumper; this looks a tough start over hurdles.
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth on bumper debut at Uttoxeter; raced freely and faded on return from a six-month break at Warwick in December; bred to stay well, being out of 2m6f-3m hurdle/chase winner, so has a trip query on hurdles debut.
