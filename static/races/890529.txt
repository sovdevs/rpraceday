🔦 Spotlight: Winless since early 2023 and he's yet to hit top form this term, soon ridden when a well-held third of eight in 3m Ayr handicap chase last month; cheekpieces go back on; others have less to prove.
Horse quote: 2023-03-26 at Carlisle (24.5f): "I thought he'd run well. It was his first time in visors for a while and Hold The Note won a bumper on heavy so I wasn't bothered about the ground. He's not the quickest but he did everything in his own time - Alistair Whillans, trainer's father."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Got off the mark over fences at Newcastle late in 2023 but he's been well below par since
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark over fences at Newcastle (2m7f) in November 2023 but he's been well below par since, cheekpieces retried when eighth over C&D last time; it's easy to look elsewhere.
Horse quote: 2023-11-23 at Newcastle (23.5f): "Goodoldbill would probably be the most expensive horse I've bought and he looked like he was going to be a bit of a dud, but he's turned a corner -Jane Walton, trainer,"
