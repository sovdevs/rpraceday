🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Tipperary after a luckless run at Leopardstown, renews rivalry with Coulstys Way
🔦 Spotlight: Experienced a luckless passage on handicap/seasonal debut at Leopardstown; well supported when making amends with an emphatic win over 1m1f at Tipperary; 7lb higher now, could be close between her and strong-finishing Tipperary third Coulstys Way, with both tackling this trip for the first time.

💬 Comment: Good chance if seeing out this longer trip after two encouraging displays at around 1m1f
🔦 Spotlight: Promising handicap debut when fourth at Bellewstown last October; poor run on heavy ground at Galway on her final start; has confirmed a decent standard of form with Tipperary third and Ballinrobe second; good chance if seeing out this longer trip.
