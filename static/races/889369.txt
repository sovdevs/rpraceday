🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Escapes a penalty for her recent 3m win at Southwell when in new cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Escapes a penalty for recent 3m win at Southwell (good to soft), which was her first run in cheekpieces and the second after wind surgery; clearly a strong contender if she's as good again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-9 but there are races in her off this mark and good ground could be ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten in the region of 10l in two handicaps (3m1f/2m7f; good to soft) since the tongue-tie was added, last time finishing fourth of 17 at Chepstow; perhaps her best run came on good ground when second in a 3m handicap last May; off since November but can run well.

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden who ran his best race when second of six at Fakenham (3m, good) two starts ago but failed to build on that when tailed off at Hereford (3m1f); on balance he has a lot to prove.
