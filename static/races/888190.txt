🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual winning hurdler and in good form lately; interesting on chase debut (1-1 in points)
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice on soft ground over hurdles at Hereford (2m4f/2m6f) last spring and, with cheekpieces fitted, has bounced back to form with two runner-up finishes at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft/good to soft); the form of both of those races has been boosted and it will be interesting to see how he takes to fences (1-1 in points).

💬 Comment: Bids for fourth win in his last five starts; major player despite 5lb rise and longer trip
🔦 Spotlight: Has suddenly taken off since returning to fences in November (form 1211) and even his tendency to jump left couldn't stop him at Hereford (2m3f, soft) last time (runner-up has won since); up another 5lb and has never tackled this far over fences before, but he was won over 2m5f over hurdles; major player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-5 over fences and may come on from his Lingfield return after more than a year off
🔦 Spotlight: Did well after being switched to fences last winter including two wins at Wincanton (2m4f, soft/good to soft); well beaten last of four at Lingfield (2m4f) last month, but he was racing on heavy ground after more than a year off so may well have needed it; no surprise if he fares better.

🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winner over fences, the last two in good-ground hunter chases (2m4f/3m) in the first half of 2022; below his best in three starts last spring following a mammoth absence and returns from another 283 days off here; has a bit to prove.
