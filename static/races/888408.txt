🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won three of his last four, rewarding good support (C&D) last week; 🔥 big player once again
🔦 Spotlight: Won three of his last four starts (the defeat came in a Class 5), most recently when well backed over C&D six days ago (Latin Five back in fifth); picked up smartly on that occasion and he's effectlvely only 3lb higher under a penalty.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a long losing run but only collared close home at Southwell (6f) latest; 2lb rise fair
🔦 Spotlight: His losing run has gathered a head of steam but he went desperately close to ending it at Southwell last month (6f), pipped at the post by a thriving rival; 2lb rise shouldn't prevent another big run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Exposed maiden; patchy recent record but his C&D third in November came off 6lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Exposed maiden; should be making more of an impact at this level but if he were to run anywhere near the level he showed over C&D in November then he'd be a danger to all.
