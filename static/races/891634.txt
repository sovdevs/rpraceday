🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Creditable second in this race last year; took her form to a new level later in 2024
🔦 Spotlight: Landed the Pretty Polly on this card in 2023 and creditable second, albeit hung left and failed to justify favouritism, in this race last year; took her form to a new level with Group 2 success at Royal Ascot and good second in French Group 1 later in 2024; leading chance on ratings.
Horse quote: 2024-06-19 at Ascot (8f): "Running Lion has been unlucky. Moves a bit soon in the Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket, gets boxed in at Epsom. We did decide, third time, Oisin, do what you want. He's drawn 11, go to the front, control it. It was perfect, because we got in a muddle in the last two races - John Gosden, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid performer whose record is 111171122; unlucky at the Breeders' Cup two starts ago
🔦 Spotlight: Solid performer whose record is 111171122; bagged Grade 1 honours in USA last July and was unlucky in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf; the form of her Meydan effort (1m1f) this year has been advertised by the winner since; 🔥 big player in this first British start for 12 months.
Horse quote: 2024-08-02 at Saratoga (9.5f): "Cinderella's Dream is obviously a classy filly. The only reservation I had was that she put up such a big speed figure there last time that I was always concerned whether there would be a bounce after that. To be fair to the team, they were always confident that she was in good order. She's gone out there and done it comfortably. You could see that when William started taking her back on the turn and waiting instead of making that move earlier. He waited until the straight and just let her stride out under a hands-and-heels ride. We'll take a view on the Breeders' Cup. What she would take to that meeting would be plenty of experience and in the Breeders' Cup you need that along with a good draw - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won last year's 1,000 Guineas on sole start under Silvestre De Sousa; drops back in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Still has low mileage; came off a strong pace to win the 1,000 Guineas on this card last year, then showed consistent form by finishing fourth in three more Group 1 races (1m/1m2f); she's 1-1 under Silvestre De Sousa, namely that Classic success, and commands respect back down in grade.
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Newmarket (8f): "Elmalka got very unbalanced. She just took a couple of strides to organise herself. I was happy with the way she travelled but she's just inexperienced. She's very tough and I think the further she's going to go the better she's going to be. She's tough and she's learning and improving. She's very easy to ride. She switches off. I was always behind the bridle so when she goes up in trip it shouldn't be a problem - Silvestre de Sousa, jockey, speaking to ITV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart but is deserted by William Buick in this first British assignment for 18 months
🔦 Spotlight: Campaigned in USA since last August, reaching a smart standard; ties in with stablemate Cinderella's Dream on Breeders' Cup running (1m3f) but performed below expectations in sole run since; deserted by William Buick in this first British assignment for 18 months.
Horse quote: 2024-02-16 at Meydan (8f): "Beautiful Love is a very nice filly and when she ran over seven last time it was always going to be too sharp. She'll appreciate stepping up even more to a mile and a quarter and hopefully she's a filly who can keep some nice company back at home - William Buick, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Absent since US Grade 1 defeat behind Cinderella's Dream ten months ago; tough task
🔦 Spotlight: Headstrong sort but she's useful and belied her 22-1 odds with a success in the 2024 Musidora; however, has been absent since US Grade 1 defeat behind Cinderella's Dream ten months ago and is bottom of this pack on ratings; tough task.
Horse quote: 2024-05-15 at York (10.5f): "Andrew was very hopeful Secret Satire had come on for her last run. She looked well and Oisin was confident, actually, when we legged him up. He hopped off and was very complimentary. That last Friday in May could definitely be an option. She looks like she'll get further and was overracing in the first half-mile. She's a gorgeous filly and the further she went the better she was. She really covers the ground and had her ears pricked - Anna-Lisa Balding, wife of trainer Andrew Balding."
