💬 Comment: Promising 2nd over C&D 16 days ago; should be more clued up today and she's a contender
🔦 Spotlight: Ended up quite wide in the closing stages of her C&D debut 16 days ago but she was keeping on well for second and should have learned from the experience; one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Three runs in 6f turf novices last year, showing fair form on the first two occasions before a lesser run on heavy when last seen in October; one to consider on his seasonal/AW debut.
