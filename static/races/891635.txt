🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shadwell filly who was impressive at Wolverhampton in sole 2yo start; interesting prospect
🔦 Spotlight: Shadwell filly who impressively justified favouritism at Wolverhampton (8.5f, AW) in sole 2yo start; fits into the could-be-anything category and looks an interesting prospect.
Horse quote: 2024-11-21 at Wolverhampton (AW) (8.5f): "Falakeyah did it very professionally. The hardest bit was pulling her up as she wanted to go round again! She's a forward-going filly and, mentally, the more racing she has the better she'll be. She was slow away from that draw and it can be messy around here sometimes but they all sorted themselves out and we had a nice trip through. Her close relation [Rowayeh] was talented and it looks like she could be the same - Jim Crowley, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Well held in the Fillies' Mile but was 2-2 previously and retains potential; new stable
🔦 Spotlight: Well held in the Fillies' Mile on final start for Sir Michael Stoute; however, 2-2 previously and retains potential; possibilities back down in class on stable/seasonal debut.
Horse quote: 2024-09-20 at Newbury (7f): "Anna Swan has the Fillies' Mile entry and would definitely stay. There's plenty of stamina in her family, but there are other options for her, including the Oh So Sharp Stakes on the same card. William was very complimentary about her and she showed she's versatile with the ground - James Savage, assistant to trainer Sir Michael Stoute."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Scored easily at Doncaster in second run last October and looks potentially useful
🔦 Spotlight: Held a 1,000 Guineas entry but goes for this 1m2f Listed option instead; scored easily at Doncaster (1m, soft) in second run last October and looks potentially useful.
Horse quote: 2024-10-25 at Doncaster (8f): "We always regarded Janey Mackers quite a bit, but it was really eyecatching. It's the race I started Wonderful Tonight in and she finished third. You can't get too carried away, but that's her last run of the season and she'll have to be entered in the nice middle-distance races next year. I'm not sure we'll enter in the 1,000 Guineas but I'm pretty sure she'll be entered in the Diane and the Oaks. I've had a lot of success with the sire New Bay and she was good from day one at the sales - David Menuisier, trainer."

💬 Comment: Two from two, both wins at Kempton; in keeping with most of her rivals, brings potential
🔦 Spotlight: Held a 1,000 Guineas entry but goes for this easier option instead; two from two, both wins at Kempton (1m/1m3f, AW); in keeping with most of her rivals, brings potential.
Horse quote: 2024-08-20 at Kempton (AW) (8f): "I thought Trad Jazz would run well. We don't turn the screw on these 2yos at home and we're learning as we go along this season with it being our first year, so a lot of that was natural ability, and she was professional. She's appreciated the surface and the mile. What she's beat I don't know, but it was a nice performance. We're treating the juveniles as 3yo types. They're horses for the future, so every run is progressive. She's going to come on a lot for that run - James Owen, speaking on Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive 2yo form (three runs) culminated in a second-place finish, belying her 40-1 odds, in Listed grade at Haydock (1m, good); she's quite a useful sort, evidently.
Horse quote: 2024-08-15 at Salisbury (8f): "Qilin Queen is a nice filly going forward. She made a pleasing debut at Newbury but was quite green that day. It was noticeable how professional she was today and she's a tall, leggy filly who'll strengthen and improve for the year. I've no doubt she'll  train on and make a nice 3yo too - Ross Coakley, jockey, talking to RacingTV."
