Horse quote: 2024-10-25 at Newbury (6.5f): "I think it was very sticky ground, but Spirit Of Farhh is still a weak shell of a horse and I think he'll be nice for next year. The second and third favourite were up there and the form was good. I'm happy - Eve Johnson Houghton, trainer."

💬 Comment: 📈 progressive 2yo campaign featured a couple of wins in the north, latest in big field
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive 2yo campaign over 6f comprised a promising effort at Glorious Goodwood then two wins in the north, latest in big field at Thirsk; likely to stay this extra furlong; enters calculations.
Horse quote: 2024-08-26 at Ripon (6f): "It was a good run at Goodwood in a stronger race than this. Huscal was learning on the job that day and the only question mark was that Ripon can be difficult for inexperienced horses. He travels, which helps when you hit a few of those ridges. He's not the finished article and should keep on improving - James Doyle, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-10-03 at Salisbury (6f): "We bought Bob Mali for only 16,000euros and he's from a stallion we're growing to love. He's three from three now and that race was worth nearly 13,000GBP to the winner. He's really exciting. He showed a bit of greenness, but in a nice way it means there's more to come. He'll be aimed at the Horris Hill Stakes. Ollie's keen to run him and we aren't afraid to have a crack - Founding partner Owen Haly."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: British form is below the level of his French Group effort; something to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Seemed to run well in French Group race on second 2yo start but his British form is below that level; ✂️ gelded since last run; something to prove off this mark on handicap/seasonal debut.
Horse quote: 2024-06-16 at Salisbury (6f): "You go to the races hoping they can get it done and I'm relieved An Outlaw's Grace did it on his debut. It was a very kind ride from Sean [Levey, jockey], he nursed him into the race and he will have learned plenty - Tim Palin, director of racing to the owners."
