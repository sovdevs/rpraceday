🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful Flat racer for Richard Hannon; made quiet start to hurdling career for new stable this year and was about 5l behind Character Testing on last month's handicap debut at Plumpton (2m, good) but may still have a bigger run in him in this sphere.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed on good ground against own age-group in the autumn and shaped pretty well before fading in sixth on last month's handicap debut at Doncaster (2m, good to soft; several flights omitted); could have a say.
