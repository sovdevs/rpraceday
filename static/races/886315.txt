🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 9yo who remains a maiden but was a good second over C&D two starts ago; possible player
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo maiden who was beaten 19l when third over C&D (heavy) last time; however, it wasn't a bad run and before that he was a good second over C&D (soft); possible player in first-time blinkers (replacing cheekpieces).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten on both chase starts but latest form has worked out well and this is weak
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten in the autumn on his two chase starts but didn't run badly when fourth of six at Wincanton last time in a race that has worked out well; this lightly raced 7yo is on a handy mark on last season's best hurdle form and today's race may not take much winning; interesting.

🔦 Spotlight: His form is up and down and he's posted just one win from his last 19 starts; however, that came here (2m3f, heavy) last February and he was a good second at Exeter (2m1f, soft) last month; in the mix if bouncing back from below-par latest performance at Exeter.
