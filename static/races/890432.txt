🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful over hurdles; ran well returned to the Flat last time; future mark 2lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Useful juvenile hurdler in the 2023-24 season, having won in Listed grade and finishing third in the Fred Winter; ran well at Chelmsford (1m6f, AW) returned to the Flat last time; future mark 2lb higher; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "It would have been nice if he'd had a smoother passage, but it's a rough race; four-year-old handicappers who have only run in small fields, but Liam Swagger is a brave horse and I'm really pleased with him. He'll have a Flat campaign now. Chester Cup - James Owen, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in the 2024 Ebor and has won both Flat outings since; should be involved
🔦 Spotlight: Useful dual-purpose performer; creditable second in the 2024 Ebor and has won both Flat outings since, the latest narrowly at Musselburgh (1m6f); 2lb badly in under a penalty but is likely to be involved.
Horse quote: 2025-04-19 at Musselburgh (14f): "Adrian told me to take my time, be brave, and Kihavah has got guts. It's a triumph to ride him because he's an absolute legend. Horses like this don't come around that often. This lad switches from jumps to the Flat and he's a privilege to train for Adrian and everyone at the yard. He's one of those that when you see you're jocked up on you're happy, as win, lose or draw, you know you'll get a great spin - PJ McDonald, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well on reappearance; needs to rebound from Musselburgh flop behind Kihavah
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a useful handicap hat-trick last summer and ran well in Nottingham Listed event on reappearance; however, needs to rebound from Musselburgh flop (finished last of 14) behind Kihavah.
Horse quote: 2024-08-03 at Goodwood (14f): "Jason Hart galloped Align The Stars in July last year before he'd ever run and said he'll win the Ascot Gold Cup, and we're still bang on track.   He still hasn't really raced over a relentless mile and six furlongs and I think an emphasis on stamina in the St Leger is really going to take him to the next level. It will take another step up for him to be competitive, but I have enough faith in him that it's a realistic aim.  I think back to Subjectivist at the same part of his career and he went to the Leger and it was too sharp a test for him, but then he won a Group 1 in the Prix Royal Oak as a three-year-old - Charlie Johnston, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has several pieces of Group form; possibilities if proving suited by this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 0-7 since winning his first two races but has several pieces of middle-distance Group form; returns to turf after two AW attempts and has possibilities off current mark, provided the new trip suits.
Horse quote: 2023-06-03 at Epsom (12f): "To see Artistic Star finish off the way he did was really pleasing as it showed he can compete at this level on a conventional track. He will stay a mile six and we can do that later on in the year, but for now we will stay at a mile and a half - Rob Hornby, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Creditable third at Southwell (1m6f, AW) on seasonal debut; successful twice on turf last summer and looks interesting returned to this sphere with Saffie Osborne back on board, being 1-1 under this rider.
Horse quote: 2024-07-19 at Haydock (14f): "It was a really nice, straightforward performance. Story Horse was unlucky not to win the last day as he was very impressive at Lingfield. It was nice to see him get his head in front and I had a very smooth trip round. It couldn't have been easier - Saffie Osborne, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Brings notable form, having finished third in the Ebor and the November Handicap last season; still getting no help from the assessor, however, and has nothing in hand off current mark.
Horse quote: 2024-08-24 at York (14f): "I never expected Oneforthegutter to get in off his mark, but has run a huge race. He and Joe have just gelled together and ultimately just got outstayed. It was a huge performance and a little bit better than the what we were expecting. Class as much as anything beat him today but we'll look for similar sort of things. He could turn out in the Old Borough Cup at Haydock if it doesn't come around too quickly - Ian Williams, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointing favourite last time, on the back of hurdles win; others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: Contrasting performances the last twice, winning over hurdles then disappointing favourite (last of ten) back on the Flat; not sure what to expect from him and this looks a difficult task anyway.
Horse quote: 2024-05-25 at Chester (12.5f): "I was tasked with finding the owners a fun dual-purpose horse and I hope Cavern Club can keep going forward and win a few more races. He will definitely go hurdling at some point; he's already done lots of schooling. The Northumberland Plate could definitely be a target, but there's a few more runs to go before then - James Owen, trainer."
