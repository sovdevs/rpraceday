🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner who found only the one too good in Aintree's Grade 1 at Christmas
🔦 Spotlight: Looked good at Fakenham (good) and even better here in November (good to soft) when making all for a 12l success; gave Potter's Charm something to think about when promoted to a Grade 1 at Aintree (soft) and that sets the standard here; every chance.

💬 Comment: 2-3 over hurdles; needs to jump better but his raw ability is much respected
🔦 Spotlight: Very talented bumper horse who was beaten first time out over hurdles (by a good one) but made no mistake in his next two, albeit soft races for which he was long odds-on; entitled to jump better as he gains experience and for raw ability he's probably right up there in this company.

🔦 Spotlight: Two-time bumper winner and was unbeaten over hurdles (on good ground) until he found his wheels spinning on soft when fourth in the Grade 1 Formby at Aintree on Boxing Day; has ground to make up with Miami Magic but should give a better account of himself under these conditions (assuming they don't ease overnight).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Keen-going front-runner but very talented and Kempton should suit him well
🔦 Spotlight: Beat a good horse in his bumper; the final flight cost him dear on two visits to Newbury (a long way clear when falling on the second occasion) and his jumping wasn't foot-perfect when making all at long odds-on at Uttoxeter (good to soft); however, he won that comfortably despite again pulling hard and he deserves his crack at this level; Kempton should suit him.
