🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won two starts back and another good effort latest; turf's fine and he could be the answer
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the ninth attempt when coming from off the pace to win a 6f handicap at Lingfield (also raced wide) this month and backed that up nine days later with a solid second off 5lb higher at Wolverhampton over 5f (again AW), despite fluffing the start; same mark here and he also ran well on this forecast good to firm ground at Bath three starts back; could be the answer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat Watkins by half a length last time and should go well again under the 6lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Made the breakthrough at the 11th attempt when she capitalised on a falling mark to score on AW at Lingfield (5f) a week ago, beating Watkins by half a length; needs to do more to confirm those placings under a 6lb penalty, but Alec Voikhansky takes off a useful 3lb and she acts on good to firm.

💬 Comment: Second to She Went Whoosh a week ago and he's weighted to get the better of her this time
🔦 Spotlight: All handicap starts on AW but seven of his eight winning siblings scored on turf; best form when second to She Went Whoosh at Lingfield (5f; refitted hood, retained) a week ago, having been ridden patiently; yet to win but better off with that rival now and those hold-up tactics could be the key to him.

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed filly who drops in trip for her reappearance; cheekpieces go on; possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten about 6l in 6f/1m maidens on either side of a tough task in a York sales race and she made a respectable handicap debut when fourth at Leicester (6f, heavy) in October; cheekpieces enlisted on this reappearance and first crack at 5f, while this 🔍 unexposed filly's yard has been among the winners lately, including with seasonal newcomers.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Weakened over 7f on AW last time; best form came over 5f on turf last April; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Best form when fourth of ten at Windsor over 5f (good) last April and he made a pleasing start for second 🆕 new yard when a well-backed third over 6f last month (nearest finish); his supporters hadn't returned when he weakened quickly over 7f (also AW; 25-1) three weeks ago but he's not totally ruled out on this drop in trip and return to turf.

💬 Comment: Last on his stable/handicap debut (7f) 15 days ago and now tries sprinting in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: From a family of milers and all starts so far at 1m (debut) and 7f; made a low-key stable/handicap debut when last of ten at Kempton (7f; weakened quickly) 15 days ago and he's now tried in cheekpieces (a sibling won both his races wearing them) on this first go sprinting.
