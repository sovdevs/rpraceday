🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Questions to answer after Limerick run but much respected on C&D run
🔦 Spotlight: Showed ability in two AQPS Flat races and a Listed hurdle in France in 2023; started favourite on Irish debut early in December over C&D but jumping lacked fluency when third to a stablemate; dropped out quickly three out at Limerick later in month when tried hooded (retained here); questions to answer now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent second here over slightly shorter trip; should make a bold bid
🔦 Spotlight: Fulfilled earlier promise when running away with a Limerick bumper in November and much improved on second attempt hurdling when a clear second to a useful sort in 2m1f mares maiden here last month (soft), each time forcing it; should make a bold bid.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Will appreciate drop back to maiden company but needs to jump better
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner (including on soft) made an encouraging start over hurdles when runner-up in 2m4f Cork maiden on good ground in November and similar RPR on latest when bit out of depth in Punchestown mares' Listed novice, jumping far from fluent; will appreciate drop back to maiden company but needs to jump better.
