üí¨ Comment: Tongue-tie seems to have brought about a return to form, good prospects in this company
üî¶ Spotlight: Bumper winner for Rose Dobbin at Kelso in 2023; fair third on hurdling/Irish debut at Fairyhouse before losing form; addition of a tongue-tie seemed to work when a 33-1 fourth at Naas; another solid display when third behind well-fancied stablemate at Navan; good prospects in this company.
