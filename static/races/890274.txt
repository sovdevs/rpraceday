🔦 Spotlight: Back from a similar break to win a C&D heavy-ground handicap on this card 12 months ago and later in the year won twice at Roscommon (7.5f, soft); has shown that he can live with this mark and go well fresh, so on the shortlist.

🔦 Spotlight: 6f/7f wins on the AW before finishing third of four upped to 1m at Dundalk where he was close up behind Big Gossey off level weights; should be well handicapped off this lower turf mark but soft ground could be troublesome.

🔦 Spotlight: Second in a Listed race last spring and later won a 5f maiden (good) on seventh career start; beaten under 4l in a Group 3 next time (6f) and then ran in a useful conditions race; could have a future off this sort of mark in handicaps.
