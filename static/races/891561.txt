💬 Comment: Up 4lb for winning (from a wide stall) last time; good chance of a follow-up on turf debut
🔦 Spotlight: Tends to race prominently; all starts on AW; knocking on the door prior to getting off the mark at the ninth attempt, when doing well to win from the widest stall at Wolverhampton (7f) this month; up 4lb now and he dwelt that day (not for the first time) but there may be more to come from him.

💬 Comment: Similar form the last twice and now makes her turf/handicap debut; likely better to come
🔦 Spotlight: Has led; all four starts on AW and similar form when third in 7f maidens the last twice, latterly at Southwell in February; dam was a 1m-1m2f winner, including three times on turf, and this 3yo now makes her debut on this surface in her first handicap; should give it a good go.

💬 Comment: Off the mark (1m, AW; made all) latest and has form at 7f on good to firm; handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning reappearance when landing a Lingfield AW maiden (1m; made all) in a first-time hood (retained) at the start of this month, despite displaying an awkward head carriage; had form over 7f on good to firm ground last year and she warrants respect on her handicap debut.

💬 Comment: Another filly to make her turf/handicap debut having shown promise on AW; respected
🔦 Spotlight: All three starts on AW; promising debut when fourth (6f; 100-1) but then a beaten favourite either side of a 166-day break, last time when fourth (7f, Kempton again) having reared at the start and raced freely; doesn't look thrown in for her handicap debut and first go on turf but she retains potential and her half-brother won here (on soft).

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing favourite at Nottingham on this month's handicap/stable debut (slowly away) and again safely held when his backers deserted him at Epsom (also 1m, good; 66-1) last week; this race is easier but he's got a bit to prove now and cheekpieces are given a go.
