🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark under rules at the ninth attempt in Catterick maiden (3m1f, good to soft) last month; fair third of six back in a handicap at Huntingdon (3m1f, good to soft) ten days later and, while he's not obviously well treated, there's every chance he can be involved today.

🔦 Spotlight: Two hurdle wins early last year and went close over fences at Fontwell in November; on a handy mark on that form and can't be totally dismissed, but this 10yo has been disappointing on his last three starts (hurdles/fences).

🔦 Spotlight: Very useful chaser in his prime; he's tumbled down the weights but this 11yo has struggled to get competitive over fences this winter and was sold out of Ciaran Murphy's yard for 6,500gns in February; winless since 2021, and 0-13 over hurdles, and may be best watched on stable debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well handicapped on old form but soundly beaten on both starts this year, after absence
🔦 Spotlight: Well handicapped on his French/British form up to spring 2023 but soundly beaten on both starts this year, following a long absence; this 9yo needs to raise his game in first-time cheekpieces.
