🔦 Spotlight: Made the perfect start for this yard, following 252-day break, when significantly down in trip to score off a career-low mark at Stratford (2m1f, good to soft) a month ago; back up 6lb but won comfortably that day and his peak mark was another 24lb higher, so he could be the type to build back up.

💬 Comment: Shaped encouragingly on last month's return from a 556-day break; can do better
🔦 Spotlight: Flat, hurdle and chase winner in France but his losing spell goes back to 2021; 0-6 for current yard but he'd been absent for 556 days before last month's return at Ludlow (2m, good; Famoso third) and didn't shape at all badly, despite finishing last of the four to complete; raced rather freely that day too and may well take a step forward.
