🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close on chase debut at Worcester; didn't build on it at Cheltenham but not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Two novice hurdle wins last term and she went close on her chase debut at Worcester (2m7f, soft) in September; failed to build on that when sixth in mares' handicap at Cheltenham (2m4f, good to soft) in December but that was still a fair run and she could have more to offer for her top yard.

🔦 Spotlight: Won maiden hurdle at Wincanton (1m7f, soft) last March and placed in all four handicap hurdles since (2m4f/2m5f, soft/good to soft; unraced on good ground); top trainer's horses often make better chasers than hurdlers and this consistent 7yo is respected on his first run over fences.

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 6yo who could relish the step back up in trip; possible player
🔦 Spotlight: Point and novice hurdle winner who kept on for a creditable second at Exeter (2m3f, soft) in January on his second chase start; the drop back in trip looked against him when 10l second at Wincanton (1m7f, soft) last time; goes back up in distance today and this 🔍 unexposed 6yo could have a major part to play if handling the ground (unproven on good/good to soft).
