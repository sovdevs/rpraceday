🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Just beaten by Rebel Path over 6f here last time; both wins over 5f came on soft turf
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Lingfield winner (7f/6f) since December and ran well despite hanging right when beaten half a length by Rebel Path (clear of the third) over 6f here nine days ago; 2lb better off with that rival, but both wins over this trip came on soft turf, so he does have something to prove.
