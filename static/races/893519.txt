💬 Comment: Made all at Nottingham two weeks ago; this is a stronger race and he's 2lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins from seven starts for 🆕 new yard, making all at Nottingham (5f, good) two weeks ago; no obvious reason why he should not be thereabouts again, although this is a stronger race and he's 2lb higher.

🔦 Spotlight: Not the easiest to predict but he's back to his last winning turf mark and he ran well after three months off when close second of six at Leicester (5f, good to firm) three weeks ago; chance if on a going day.
Horse quote: 2023-10-20 at Redcar (6f): "Glendown has done it quite nicely, he travelled well and picked up and just did enough to win. He ran a great race at Chester and I don't know what went wrong last time [at Hamilton] - he just ran all right. He's come here and shown he's in good form - Duran Fentiman, rider"

He did everything right and showed he's a very good horse.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Often makes the frame but on a long losing run; others appeal more for win purposes
🔦 Spotlight: Often makes the frame but his losing run stretches back to June 2022; 5f on a sound surface is ideal and he reappears after five months on a career-low mark, but others still make a bit more appeal for win purposes.

💬 Comment: Below par since last summer's win but well handicapped and hood could have positive effect
🔦 Spotlight: Below par since winning at Ripon (5f, good) last summer but there have been some excuses, notably when repeatedly short of room on reappearance; others have more obvious claims but he's becoming well handicapped and the first-time hood could have a positive effect.
