🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid efforts on last two course runs; latest effort excusable; still feasibly weighted
🔦 Spotlight: Came from off the pace to win a 1m handicap here in December and was a good third off this mark two weeks later; wouldn't judge him too harshly on latest Newcastle effort and he should get a better pace to aim at back at 7f; considered.
