🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Finished behind Pickersgill at Naas, experience of second run can help her to reverse form
🔦 Spotlight: Cost 300,000gns as a yearling; apprentice-ridden and easy-to-back first time out over 6f at Naas; faded to finish seventh of 12, fourth of five in a group headed by third-placed Pickersgill; picked up further experience when runner-up over 5f at Dundalk in November; return to 6f should suit; fair prospects of reversing form with Pickersgill.

🔦 Spotlight: First two runs were over 7f; showed considerable improvement when dropped to this trip at Naas in October, taking third behind a Joseph O'Brien-trained favourite; again shaped well when second to a promising newcomer from the same source over C&D nine days later.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Failed to reach the first four at two but showed enough to suggest she can win races
🔦 Spotlight: Earned a handicap rating of 80 after three unplaced runs at two; possibly flattered by a mark that puts her 4lb ahead of the twice-placed Pickersgill; best run when fifth behind subsequent Listed winner Chantez over 7f at Leopardstown; beaten around 8l in sixth over this trip at Naas; first-time cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in maidens over C&D and over 5f at Tipperary last May; failed to match that form over 5f at Down Royal in June; not beaten far in fifth in a late-season 5f maiden at Navan; could get into the money if reproducing her early-season juvenile form.
