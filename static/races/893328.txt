🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 125-rated hurdler, good effort in second chase at Naas, gets weight from the boys, claims
🔦 Spotlight: 1-7 over hurdles and rated 125; much better on second chase start when a 1.5l second at Naas over 2m4f on soft (Dancingondaceiling 7.25l behind) and given a chase rating of 128; the drop back in trip shouldn't inconvenience her and she gets weight from the boys; claims.
Horse quote: 2022-12-26 at Limerick (16f): "Foxy Girl has a fair bit of scope. She jumps quickly and put her head down. It's early days yet but she had good placed form and is one to look forward to - Mike O'Connor, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Rated 135 after three chase starts; solid efforts in beginners' at Tipperary and Thurles; outclassed when beaten 24l in a Grade 1 novice at Limerick in between those runs; likes soft ground and has an obvious chance for top yard.
Horse quote: 2024-01-24 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Mirazur West is still learning. He settled a lot better today than he did at Leopardstown. He is well able to jump and is going the right way - Mark Walsh, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: 2-3 and rated 121 over hurdles; fell on chase debut and finished an 8.75l fourth of 15 in a Naas beginners' latest (2m4f, soft) when behind Foxy Girl; both his hurdles wins came at around 3m so not sure this drop back in trip will suit.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-7 over fences, has run well in defeat, trip too far latest, don't discount back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Winning hurdler is 0-7 over fences and rated 125; best effort in this sphere a 5.5l second of 14 in a beginners' at Ballinrobe (2m1f, yielding) last May; trip may have stretched him on latest at Clonmel; his experience is a plus and he's won on testing ground; not discounted dropped in trip.
Horse quote: 2022-12-28 at Limerick (16f): "Maidenstreetprince had a good run the last day and was getting a few pounds today. He was a bit free and there is room for improvement in his jumping. He stuck it out well. We'll see what the handicapper does - Charles Byrnes, trainer."

💬 Comment: Dual-purpose, 140s rated hurdler, not bred for chasing but has ability, needs rain to miss
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose sort; chase debutant; rated 141 over hurdles and not disgraced in the County Hurdle off 143 when beaten 5.25l on latest; not an obvious candidate for chasing on breeding but he clearly has plenty of ability; best form is on good-yielding so probably needs the rain to miss.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner over timber, decent first chase effort, ground versatile, has a chance
🔦 Spotlight: 2-13 over hurdles, including a win here, but out of form in that sphere since the turn of the year; well-beaten at Cheltenham and 16l behind Aspire Tower on his chase debut at Wexford just over two weeks ago; this is easier and he handles most ground; not without a chance.
Horse quote: 2024-05-01 at Punchestown (19.5f): "Harsh like a big field and I thought he won well. The hustle and bustle suited him, he travelled and jumped great - Joseph O'Brien, trainer"

Horse quote: 2025-02-23 at Naas (23f): "I was very unsure how Will The Wise was going to handle the ground. I thought he could weaken coming to the last but he dug deep. He's also in the Albert Bartlett but we'll have to see what the handicapper does as well - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."
