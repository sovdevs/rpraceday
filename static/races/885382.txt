💬 Comment: Ran well almost every time in handicap hurdles and 2nd over C&D last May in his only chase
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well almost every time in handicap hurdles and runner-up over C&D last May on his only chase start, despite needing to improve his jumping; overall improvement might be required on return to chasing but it may well be possible.

💬 Comment: Back to some form in 4th of 19 for handicap chase at Fairyhouse (3m2f, soft) two weeks ago
🔦 Spotlight: One of two declared by his Irish trainer for this meeting; first-time blinkers were added to tongue-tie when he shot back to some form in fourth of 19 for handicap chase at Fairyhouse (3m2f, soft) two weeks ago; could still do with brushing up his jumping but he looks of renewed interest, particularly given last season's better form over hurdles.

💬 Comment: Leicester win (extended 2m6f, soft) last time but it's not all been plain sailing
🔦 Spotlight: Had two wind operations last year; sent handicap chasing since and vastly more competitive on two of those three starts, winning at Leicester (extended 2m6f, soft; up 4lb today) on latest; that was encouraging but it's also not forgotten that he ran no race on penultimate start.

🔦 Spotlight: Made his handicap debut last March and is now 19lb lower, having been well held when he took minor honours on last three outings; probably stays 3m but arguably needs better than soft ground; tongue-tie and cheekpieces are now given a first go.

🔦 Spotlight: One of two declared by his Irish trainer for this meeting; first-time blinkers were added to tongue-tie when he shot back to some form in fourth of 19 for handicap chase at Fairyhouse (3m2f, soft) two weeks ago; could still do with brushing up his jumping but he looks of renewed interest, particularly given last season's better form over hurdles.

🔦 Spotlight: Cheekpieces have been installed this season, with a good second at Southwell (2m4f, good) on first occasion but she was not in quite the same form on soft ground on either start since; stamina to prove after one attempt at 3m (last March) and improvement is needed on this chase debut.
