💬 Comment: Needs things to go exactly to plan; second C&D win when beating Dash Gordon last week
🔦 Spotlight: A far better sprinter than his win record suggests as things must go exactly to plan but he is a dual C&D winner who didn't lack for enthusiasm when seeing off stablemate Dash Gordon last week; still far from a reliable betting proposition.
