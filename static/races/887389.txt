🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 back from break (after gelding operation); up another 6lb but more appealing than many
🔦 Spotlight: He has looked an improved performer since returning to action (✂️ gelded during his absence) this year, following an easy 8.6f maiden win at Wolverhampton with a front-running success in a handicap over the same C&D 17 days later; 6lb rise asks more of him but he could be up to the task.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won on Good Friday last year; repeat of that success likely to be the main aim; fair mark
🔦 Spotlight: Won the 1m handicap at Newcastle on Good Friday off 4lb lower; a repeat is likely to be the main focus this spring but he won at Chelmsford (7f) in December and he is still feasibly weighted on his 2024 best; stable also run Witch Hunter.

💬 Comment: Group 1 placed last year; capable off this mark but he'll need them to go fast early
🔦 Spotlight: No win since coming from off the pace to win a Group 2 at Newbury (7f, good to soft) in August 2023; had some fine form in defeat last year though, placed in the Lockinge and rounding off his season with a good third in the Balmoral Handicap (1m, soft) on Champions Day; stall 1 not ideal for a slow starter and he'll need to circle the field in the straight but he has the ability to play a starring role if they go hard early.
