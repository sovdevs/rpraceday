🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Relished return to timber this season; only narrowly denied in hat-trick bid latest
🔦 Spotlight: Has relished a return to hurdles this season and was only narrowly denied in his hat-trick bid at Gowran last time; mixed signals on the strength of that form and up another 6lb but he's in better form than most of these and warrants respect; 🆕 new yard.
