🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four wins in 2024, one over C&D; has share of weight but running well; bang there
🔦 Spotlight: Ended a long losing run last June and went on to add three more races, one over C&D; 5lb higher than for the latest of them but three tight finishes show he can add another in the right company; has more going for him than most.
Horse quote: 2019-09-29 at Curragh (5f): "Kondratiev Wave had plenty of pace we thought. He might prefer a little bit further but with the soft ground his stamina came into play. We've always liked him - Kieran Cotter, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f winner in Ireland in 2021; better known as a sprinter now; faded back at 7f in March
🔦 Spotlight: A 7f winner in Ireland four years ago but better known as a sprinter these days and he didn't find anything back over 7f at Newcastle two runs ago; has it to prove on course debut.
Horse quote: 2021-05-04 at Gowran Park (7f): "It was a good performance and Bellagio Man had to be brave. He had a terrible draw but it helped that the favourite got stuck in the stalls. Fair play to Colin and the horse as they took advantage of that. He's still a green horse and will improve from it. He was in front a long way from home and it was a fair performance. He wouldn't ideally like that ground, it went a bit slow, and we were a bit nervous before the race with the heavy showers yesterday and today. He's a good ground horse but because it was the first race we said we'd take our chance and we got away with it - Shane Lyons, assistant trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Losing run goes back to 2023 but he won four times that year, including over C&D, and his recent form over 7f elsewhere gives every indication he'll be involved this time as well.
Horse quote: 2023-10-24 at Wolverhampton (AW) (7f): "Triggered travelled through the race well and picked up good. We went very quick but he won well in the end - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest wins were four in 2023; in good form over 7f of late; can be involved again
🔦 Spotlight: Losing run goes back to 2023 but he won four times that year, including over C&D, and his recent form over 7f elsewhere gives every indication he'll be involved this time as well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all over C&D this month; couldn't lead next time;  pace-setting tactics possible here
🔦 Spotlight: Was having a rare run at 7f when seizing the initiative and holding on over C&D (first-time eyeshield) this month but he couldn't lead and dropped right out at Lingfield last week; 5lb higher than for the win but pace-setting again could work from draw near the rail.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two 6f wins on AW and turf in 2024; well beaten for 🆕 new yard; best watched on first 7f run
🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f wins on Kempton Polytrack and turf for Robert Cowell but he went off the boil on final starts for him and hasn't showed up in two runs for 🆕 new yard; best watched on first 7f run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All wins at sprint trips; out of sorts this year but mark is crashing; first 7f run
🔦 Spotlight: Has done his winning at sprint trips, including here, but nothing noteworthy since returning from a break this year and this first 7f run doesn't entice; still one to keep an eye on, though, as his mark heads south.
Horse quote: 2022-08-03 at Brighton (5.5f): "Antiphon is a legend of a horse, just so easy to train and he's run seven times for us since we bought him in February and he hasn't been out of the winner's circle. From where we were stood on the stands it looked like we'd been touched off, but he's so tough - Michael Keady, joint-trainer."
