🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Something to find but the better ground & longer trip may be positives; not ruled out e-w
🔦 Spotlight: Below par at Ayr (2m5f, soft) a fortnight ago and this handicapper has something to find now moving into a Listed race; however, the return to better ground could suit and she's hinted that today's step up in trip may prompt improvement; not ruled out each-way.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has much better strike-rate over fences but entitled to respect in view of her chase form
🔦 Spotlight: She's 2-17 over hurdles as opposed to 7-27 over fences and is unraced in this sphere since November 2023; however, won twice over fences this season (3m1f/2m4f, good/good to soft) and will be a major player if transferring that form back to hurdles.
