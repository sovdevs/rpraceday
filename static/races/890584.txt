🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bled last time but had previously shaped well when second; has had wind surgery
🔦 Spotlight: 1m3f winner on Flat in France; made much of running when second of nine at Exeter (2m, good) on hurdling debut last autumn, pulling clear with winner; pulled hard and bled at Wetherby five weeks later; now returns from five months off after a breathing operation, in a first-time tongue-strap and a re-fitted hood; risky but clearly talented.

💬 Comment: 0-9 in Ireland but more encouragement on debut for 🆕 new yard when second  at Newton Abbot
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; had nine goes over hurdles for Gavin Cromwell in Ireland, finishing placed just once and subsequently sold cheaply; more encouragement on debut for 🆕 new yard when second of five at Newton Abbot (2m5f, good) last Thursday, headed last after making running and jumping right; cheekpieces (worn once in Ireland) back on today; should be thereabouts.
