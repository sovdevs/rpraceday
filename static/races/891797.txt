💬 Comment: First and second over C&D in last two starts; better drawn than last time; major player
🔦 Spotlight: In good form since returning from 135 days off last month, finishing first (beating Ravenglass by a neck) and second over C&D in his last two starts; up another 2lb, but is much better drawn than last time and looks a major player.
