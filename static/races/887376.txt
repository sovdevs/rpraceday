🏇 Jockey: Billy Loughnane (Rank: 5.0) (9.0/ 46.0 runs) RTF: N/A (OVR%: 11%)
🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Did it easily over C&D on Saturday night and can make light of a 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Easily gained Chelmsford win number two under Billy Loughnane on Saturday night, her first attempt at 1m2f; this is a lower class of handicap and a 5lb penalty is unlikely to stop her if showing up in similar form.

💬 Comment: In good form this year and one of the more likely types in new blinkers (replacing visor)
🔦 Spotlight: Delivered on earlier promise when landing an 8.6f handicap at Wolverhampton last month and even better form when second under a 5lb penalty there (9.4f) 24 hours later; only fourth at Southwell (1m) since but still respected here in a change of headgear (first-time blinkers for visor).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten on recent return from long absence for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Two 1m wins on turf much earlier in his career; in reasonable form over hurdles for Alexandra Dunn in spring 2023 but well held on the Flat in April of that year and not seen again until down the field over 7f at Wolverhampton for new trainer Michael Wigham 16 days ago; can only watch.
