💬 Comment: Running well lately, but needs a good pace to aim at and may not find this run to suit
🔦 Spotlight: Five of his six AW wins have come at Wolverhampton and he only just failed to get up there (5f) on Monday, but his other success came over this C&D; however, he is totally reliant on getting a good pace to aim at and there must be a doubt as to whether he will get that in this small field.

🔦 Spotlight: Nothing in two starts for John Quinn on turf in September 2023, but after 17 months off and having been gelded he finished a close third of five on stable debut in a Wolverhampton novice (5f, Tapeta) last month; needs to step up again on handicap debut but could do so.

🔦 Spotlight: Five of his six AW wins have come at Wolverhampton and he only just failed to get up there (5f) on Monday, but his other success came over this C&D; however, he is totally reliant on getting a good pace to aim at and there must be a doubt as to whether he will get that in this small field.

💬 Comment: Running well lately, but needs a good pace to aim at and may not find this run to suit
🔦 Spotlight: Five of his six AW wins have come at Wolverhampton and he only just failed to get up there (5f) on Monday, but his other success came over this C&D; however, he is totally reliant on getting a good pace to aim at and there must be a doubt as to whether he will get that in this small field.
