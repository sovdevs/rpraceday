💬 Comment: Improved this year, fine effort behind 90 rated rival at Navan, bred to stay, claims
🔦 Spotlight: Mild promise sole start at two; much better in two runs this season and was conceding 5lb when getting to within 0.75l of the now 90 rated Mississippi River at Navan (1m, good); yet to race beyond 1m but is plenty of stamina in his pedigree; big chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Anjaal filly, 200-1 when slowly away and well beaten on debut, hard to fancy
🔦 Spotlight: Anjaal filly was slowly away and never involved when beating just one rival home on debut when a 200-1 shot at Ballinrobe (9.5f, good); hard to fancy after that effort.
