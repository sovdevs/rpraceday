🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Career-best win at the Curragh latest; form franked; 8lb higher but in flying form
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth in the Lincoln on return; produced a career-best when comfortably winning at the Curragh (1m, soft) last month off 90; Apercu (fourth) gave the form a nice boost when winning at Cork on Saturday; 8lb higher now but drop in trip is fine and will have the fitness edge over some of these.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Curragh (8f): "Indigo Five won well and is a tough mare. She's probably Listed class but we might take on another handicap before that. She's won on good and heavy so she's versatile. She stays well and I think should get a mile and a quarter - John Feane, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Bolted up at this course (1m, soft) on her debut 12 months ago; third behind now 106-rated Big Gossey at the Curragh in November; out of her depth in AW Listed at Chantilly when last seen in November; stable won three of the last four runnings of this race; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to convince she wants 7f, especially on ground this deep, but still warrants respect
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win came last April at Naas (6f, yielding); generally reliable filly who ran well on return when third over 6f at the Curragh last month; yet to convince she truly wants 7f, especially on ground this deep, but still warrants plenty of respect.
Horse quote: 2024-04-29 at Naas (6f): "Tai Tam Bay is small but very very tough. A couple of times last year she looked like winning but was just too hard on herself early on and got caught at the finish. We spent a lot of time over the winter trying to get that out of her. We said today we'd let her bowl along over the short six and not be fighting her. I think seven, even a mile, is what she wants in my book - Edward Harty, trainer, speaking to Racing TV"

💬 Comment: Four-time winner; seventh of 27 in Lincoln on stable debut last month; entitled to go well
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner and has placed at this track three times from four attempts; won twice last year, including an early-season handicap at Cork (7f, heavy); respectable seventh of 27 in the Lincoln on stable debut last month; entitled to go well.
Horse quote: 2021-12-10 at Dundalk (AW) (7f): "Indepenent Expert is a light little filly but the race conditions suited her. She was in well at the weights, so it's great she's a winner at two. It was a valuable race and the owner also has an incentive to buy another horse, getting a 10,000Euros voucher to buy a yearling at an Irish sale. That's it for this year, she ran well at Gowran on testing ground, so she could have a nice mark for turf handicaps early in the season - Andy Slattery, trainer."
