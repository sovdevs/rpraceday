💬 Comment: Failed to justify support on debut and finished well held twice more since; market useful
🔦 Spotlight: Sister to the useful Forceful Speed, who improved with time; perhaps this one will do the same, having failed to justify support on debut last summer and finished well held twice more since; it will be interesting to see how she goes in the market.
