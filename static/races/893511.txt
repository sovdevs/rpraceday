💬 Comment: Close second on handicap debut at Nottingham (1m, good); it looks like she will stay 1m2f
🔦 Spotlight: 9-1, improved markedly when keeping on to be a close second of eight on handicap debut at Nottingham (1m, good) 15 days ago; up 2lb but this filly is well related and it looks like she will stay 1m2f.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Thirsk (1m, good) last September on handicap debut; ran creditably in two of three subsequent starts, with the latest (1m, soft) and family both giving plenty of hope for 1m2f; improvement is needed but possible.

💬 Comment: 0-9; has threatened a win and she was second of five at Wolverhampton (AW) one month ago
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 for Peter Chapple-Hyam and 0-2 this year for current yard; has threatened a win, notably on two starts (1m2f/1m4f) last summer, and she was second of five from the front in handicap at Wolverhampton (9.4f, AW) one month ago, so she enters the equation.

💬 Comment: Reappears on a good mark but she was well held first time out in the last two seasons
🔦 Spotlight: Won back to back from off the pace over 1m2f at Ayr (good) and Redcar (soft) last May but had a mixed record afterwards; reappears today on a good mark but she was well held first time out in the last two seasons.
Horse quote: 2023-10-07 at Redcar (10f): "Shifter is going over hurdles, that's what she was bought for. I hope we might persuade them to stay a bit longer on the Flat now but she jumps like a bunny - Wilf Storey, trainer. She was gaining with every stride. You could almost step her up and go further. As soon as you pass horses on her, it lights her up - Paula Muir, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointing 2024; same owners but change of stable since she was last seen in September
🔦 Spotlight: Helped set the pace when winning at Hamilton (1m1f) and York (1m2f) in 2023 but her three runs in 2024 were disappointing; same owners but a change of stable since she was last seen in September.
