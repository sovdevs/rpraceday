🔦 Spotlight: Infrequent winner on AW (1-26); pulled hard when clipping heels but no excuse when seventh of 11 here (1m2f) last month.
Horse quote: 2024-08-13 at Lingfield (11.5f): "Looking back at his form Foinix is well capable of having a sudden change in fortunes. He feels like he's really enjoying his racing. At Brighton he didn't look like a classified horse and didn't do so again today. He can just be a little bit gassy but he gets into a beautiful rhythm. He's definitely worth a go at further trips, but keep him where he is for now because he's doing nothing wrong - Joe Leavy, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
