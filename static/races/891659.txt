🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Newcastle win in March is strong form for the grade; still well treated despite 3lb rise
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped well at York on his third 2yo start (6f, soft); fluffed his lines on his nursery debut in December but showed himself to be well handicapped when winning a strong race for the grade at Newcastle in March (5f); 3lb rise underestimates that form and he remains capable of better; has plenty of speed but should be fine at this trip.
