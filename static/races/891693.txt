🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Will need more than at Newton Abbot last time and he's bred to stay much further
🔦 Spotlight: Finished fifth in two starts for Tom Weston, getting closer the second time when 4l off the winner at Newton Abbot (good); likely that he needs to find something on that form (perhaps flattered off a steady pace) and he's bred to stay much further.

💬 Comment: Two forms of headgear fitted from the outset and yard is 0-12 in bumpers recent seasons
🔦 Spotlight: Second foal out of a 2m2f hurdle runner-up and sister to bumper winner Mozo; it's not overly encouraging to see two forms of headgear fitted from the outset and yard is 0-12 in bumpers recent seasons.
