💬 Comment: Left clear at Huntingdon but might have won anyway and he's on a roll; up 10lb
🔦 Spotlight: Has won all five completed starts for this yard but he went up 10lb for Huntingdon last time (2m7f, good) where he was left clear on the home bend; however, he might have won anyway and he's on a roll.
Horse quote: 2025-03-19 at Huntingdon (23.5f): "Camino Rocio likes to get on with things and he jumped well out front. He could even get further and this good ground is important to him - Sean Bowen, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Now 3-7 over fences after making all over 3m at Exeter three weeks ago (on good ground that's ideal); he was odds-on for a weak race there but the handicapper didn't overreact with just a 3lb rise.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Kempton (2m4f, good) in November despite a serious blunder and it was his first time on soft ground when tailed off at Wincanton; well-bred gelding who should stay this far and could easily bounce back provided it doesn't get too wet.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner in November and wind surgery could enable him to get back on track
🔦 Spotlight: Beat an in-form opponent over C&D (good to soft) in November but was in trouble a long way out when a remote fourth on his return visit; wind surgery could enable him to get back on track.
Horse quote: 2024-11-27 at Hereford (25f): "Face D'Music was very good today and we're very happy. He'd been schooling very well at home and jumped brilliantly today. It was a much-needed confidence booster for Shane [Quinlan, jockey]. It's horses for courses as he won over hurdles at Hereford in May too, even though he looks like he wants a more galloping track. He's only five and a few things went wrong earlier this season, but they're going right now - Katy Price, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 100-1 winner in December but hasn't built on that at all and now tries new headgear
🔦 Spotlight: 100-1 winner at Ffos Las in December (2m6f, heavy) when making his stable debut; hasn't built on that at all and tries new headgear here.
Horse quote: 2024-12-19 at Ffos Las (21.5f): "We put a few quid on Karuma Grey, not a lot. The bookmakers got the price wrong - he loves wet ground. I reckon he is a Saturday horse if we can get him right. Shane came back and said he could be a Welsh National horse for next year - Aled Evans, owner, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
