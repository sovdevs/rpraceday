🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Top rated, solid form in 6f maidens, didn't stay 1m latest, the one to beat back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Rated 84 after four starts; not beaten far twice over 6f, at Navan on debut last October and at the Curragh on his seasonal return in March; didn't quite get home over 1m at Bellewstown latest and now drops back in trip; yard 16-91 here in the last five seasons; the one to beat.

💬 Comment: Backed on debut over 6f and faded late, different ground and lacks a run, check market
🔦 Spotlight: Now ✂️ gelded son of Belardo was backed into 15-2 from 50-1 for his October Curragh debut (6f, yld-sft) and he showed speed before weakening out of it into fifth late on; different ground here and not sure this stiff track will suit; probably best watched after his break unless the market speaks in his favour.

🔦 Spotlight: Sent off at 9-1 on debut at Dundalk (7f) but didn't land a blow; the drop back in trip here should suit on that evidence and he's related to winners at this trip; however, he'll need to improve plenty for the first-time blinkers.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rated 70, struggled on soft last twice, better ground and track should suit, place shout
🔦 Spotlight: Rated 70; excellent effort on debut at Down Royal (7f, good) last June when an unconsidered 33-1 shot; has struggled both starts at 1m this term but testing ground may not have been to her liking; this stiff track should suit, as will the better ground; place chance for yard that does well here.

💬 Comment: Profitable filly, closely related to classy Marcel, nicely bred newcomer, check market
🔦 Spotlight: Profitable filly is a sixth foal; closely related to 7f/1m 2yo winner Marcel (inc Group 1 Racing Post Trophy; RPR 118), half-brother to 1m winner Just Brilliant (inc 2yo/AW; 86); dam unraced sister to smart sprinter Munjiz; nicely bred newcomer worth a 📊 market check, though stable form is a concern.
