🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has mixed record this season but ran well last time and is suited by this C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Has very mixed record this season but his second to I'm Too Tired over C&D (good to soft; visored) on Boxing Day was a good effort and he rebounded from a poor run with a recent third (just behind Zara's Universe) at Catterick (1m7f, good to soft; wore cheekpieces); must be considered.

🔦 Spotlight: Not at best on either appearance this year but now only 1lb higher than when beating Fearless Action to open chasing account in small-field C&D (good to soft) contest on Boxing Day; swaps usual cheekpieces for first-time cheekpieces today; obvious contender if back on song.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Keen-going front-runner; 0-4 in Britain after poor run last time but not written off yet
🔦 Spotlight: Keen-going front-runner who was a dual chase winner in France last spring; performed poorly on latest outing in December and is now 0-4 in Britain but his previous two runs were quite encouraging and the refitted hood may help him to settle better today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made bold bid when second a Kelso in October but two very poor runs followed
🔦 Spotlight: 0-21 under all codes; succumbed only in closing stages after bold bid to make all at Kelso (2m1f, good to soft) in October but looked badly out of sorts on next two outings (cheekpieces added last time) and returns from 102-break with quite a bit to prove.
