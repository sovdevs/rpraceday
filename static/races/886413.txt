🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Half-brother to seven winners, four of whom achieved an RPR of 98+; betting can guide
🔦 Spotlight: Tenth foal; half-brother to seven winners, notably Juliet Foxtrot (7f-10.5f 2yo/US 8.5f Grade 1; RPR 109), Tsar (1m including AW; 107), Cartago (1m 2yo; 99) and Juliet Sierra (6f 2yo including Group 3; 98); dam 7.5f-1m winner (including Listed; 106); ✂️ gelded prior to his debut and wears a hood; lots to like on pedigree and the betting should prove a good barometer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Modest RPR but quite a bit of promise in Lingfield debut 3rd; apprentice 2-2 for the yard
🔦 Spotlight: The form of her near-6l third of nine at Lingfield (7f) seven weeks ago can't be rated highly but there were positives to take from the run, finishing off her race well from a modest position; likely to stay further in time but she should be more streetwise today and Jack Dace, who is good value for his claim, is 2-2 for Amanda Perrett; could take a marked step forward.
