🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Slow starter; seemed well suited by 1m2f when bolting up at Lingfield last week; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Habitual slow starter; stepping up in distance seems to have allowed him to get away with those misdemeanours at the start as he ran well over 1m3f at Kempton in December and landed strong market support in emphatic fashion at Lingfield last week; well in under a penalty for that success and Simon Walker retains the ride; sure to be popular again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Conditions to suit and has a good amateur booked; ran poorly on turf 19 days ago though
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins for this yard, two of them coming over C&D; signs he retained ability over the winter but he ran poorly on turf 19 days ago when 1m4f on good to firm shouldn't have been an issue; has a good amateur booked but there are risks.
