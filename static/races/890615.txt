🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Novice but he's been favourite for this handicap debut and Townend takes the ride
🔦 Spotlight: Close second to Dancing City in Grade 1 Punchestown novice hurdle (3m, good to yielding) last May; while his form as a novice chaser has not matched that, defeat at 2-13 last time was over an inadequate 2m5f and he's basically made a satisfactory transition; work to do but, faced with this new, serious stamina test, this lightly raced 8yo has been favourite this week for today's handicap debut and the stable's top jockey Paul Townend takes the ride.
Horse quote: 2025-02-20 at Punchestown (22.5f): "High Class Hero did it nicely. The ground was quite testing as they had a lot of rain before racing. He's in the Brown Advisory and he would look like that type of an animal. We'll probably head that direction. Loughglynn will probably stay at home and we'll find something for him. Overall, I'm very happy with them - Willie Mullins, trainer."

💬 Comment: Three-time Grade 1 winner as a novice hurdler; reverses in Cheltenham and Aintree Grade 1s
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Grade 1 winner as a novice hurdler, including twice last spring, and he began his chasing career in promising style with two wins this winter; there have since been significant reverses when well beaten at Cheltenham and falling at Aintree, both in Grade 1s over about 3m, but he'd previously suggested a strength in stamina which gives this test some appeal.
Horse quote: 2025-03-12 at Cheltenham (24.5f): "Dancing City was travelling well until he made a mistake at the third-last - Willie Mullins, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won this last year off 4lb lower; big shout if his Aintree run has not taken it out of him
🔦 Spotlight: Delivered late to win this race on good ground last year by a neck, 26 days after his third in a heavy-ground Irish National; he shaped as if back to his best in the Grand National three weeks ago, travelling well to dispute the lead two out but ending up seventh as the 4m2f took its toll; this trip is presumably the ideal fit and, although 4lb higher than last year, a big run should be forthcoming if Aintree has not taken it out of him.
Horse quote: 2024-01-20 at Navan (24f): "Minella Cocooner jumped spectacular there and seemed a lot more settled than he was in his hurdling days. Paul was delighted with him - Patrick Mullins, assistant trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 1lb out of the handicap; chasing last five starts, winning first attempt and creditable results in the others; performed wonders to finish fourth in the 3m6f NH Chase at Cheltenham last time, given he'd been labouring badly out the back three out, but a much more zestful, fluent display would clearly be preferable and connections therefore reach for cheekpieces.

💬 Comment: Second in the Irish Gold Cup and excellent third in the Grand National; up another 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Second in the Irish Gold Cup at Leopardstown (3m, yielding) in February and an excellent third in the Grand National at Aintree (4m2f, good to soft) three weeks ago, rallying very gamely after a bad mistake at the final fence; going up another 5lb demands that he reaches even greater heights.
Horse quote: 2025-04-05 at Aintree (34.5f): "That was some spin. Grangeclare West jumped for fun and ran the race of his life. He did something a bit similar in the Gold Cup in Ireland, but repeated that here today with eleven stone eight on his back. Going out on the second circuit I knew he was going to run a big race. I gave him a breather and then he started winging fences down the back. I thought he was going to do the business but he just got into the bottom of the last and that cost him momentum - cost him second place - Brian Hayes, rider."

💬 Comment: Worth this second crack at a marathon trip but he's 10lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Took well to chasing on good/good to soft at Cheltenham initially this term, arriving late on the scene; he'd finished strongly over an extended 3m1f but did not get anywhere near to a challenging position when below-form fifth in the 3m6f NH Chase there on latest outing; worth another crack at a marathon trip but he's 10lb out of the handicap.
Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Cheltenham (25f): "We could maybe look at the National Hunt Chase now long-term. Today was the plan as we wanted to give Transmission a couple of runs around Cheltenham. His last run was good, he had a run under his belt and has course and distance form, so we tried to tick as many boxes as possible, and the ride was second to none - Neil Mulholland, trainer."

💬 Comment: Two 3m chase wins here; could have plenty more to give but he's 12lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Bled from the nose on penultimate start but has otherwise done well switched to chasing this term, notably for two 3m wins at this track (Goshen a close third last time); just a 7yo and a lightly raced one at that, whose style of victory last time (he travelled much the best) suggested he could have plenty more to give, but he's 15lb higher today, thanks largely to his position 12lb out of the handicap.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Sandown (24f): "Harry [Skelton] got off Hoe Joly Smoke immediately and said the Scottish National, but I just wouldn't want to go to Ayr and not run well, whereas we've got two weeks and we can come here to a track we know suits him. He's improving and everything about the bet365 will suit him. I like coming back to the scene of victories and obviously he likes this track. He's still a novice over hurdles, so next year we might have one run over hurdles, then find the nicest chase we can - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: This race last year was not one of his good efforts; neither was Grand National latest
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth in the 2023 Scottish National (4m, good); commendable efforts most starts since, for instance beaten a nose by Victtorino at Ascot (3m, good; 1lb higher today) in February, but this race last year was not one of them and neither was the Grand National three weeks ago.
Horse quote: 2024-02-17 at Ascot (24f): "Threeunderthrufive is not going to go to Cheltenham in three weeks and Max is quite keen on him running in the National. I've always had a reservation about his jumping but today it was as good as I've ever seen. He lost his way a bit last year and it never happened. I've tinkered with his wind a bit in the summer and he's ran three solid races this year and just got better and better - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6yo with time on his side; best form last time out when winning a 2m4f beginners chase
🔦 Spotlight: His sole start over 3m saw him pulled up, on heavy ground admittedly, but the furthest he's been otherwise was 2m5f and that too was a failure; 6yo with time on his side and his best form last time out, winning a 2m4f beginners chase at Clonmel, but big improvement is required and his suitability for this test requires plenty of guesswork.
Horse quote: 2025-03-27 at Clonmel (20f): "Lombron made me work for that. He made that mistake at the first fence down the back but there were some fence attendants on the track when we came round the bend and I'd say he had one eye on those orange jackets. He impressed me when he won first time over hurdles but he regressed after that. I hope he'll be a better chaser - Paul Townend, jockey, talking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4-5 over 3m at right-handed Ascot and finished strongly over 3m2f at Newbury in November
🔦 Spotlight: Poor Cheltenham record was extended at the Festival last time; 3m at right-handed Ascot, on the other hand, produced four wins (two on good ground) from five attempts and his strong finish in Newbury's big 3m2f handicap in November catches the eye with regard to today's new trip; his stable has had a long dry spell recently (it ended on Thursday) but he's a strong candidate otherwise.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Ascot (24f): "I thought Victtorino was beaten but that was great. The ground is loose but I don't think it's testing and there were still lots of horses there with three to jump. I thought we were going to get outsprinted but it was nice to see the first and second were up there the whole way around - Venetia Williams, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won his last three, smoothly on last two; 8lb out of handicap, on top of latest 7lb rise
🔦 Spotlight: Ran poorly in December on sole visit here; tongue-tie went on when he won all three starts since (Huntingdon, Warwick and Newbury) and, following wind surgery, he's done it pretty smoothly on last two occasions; however, he's not proven beyond an extended 2m7f (this is his first run much beyond 3m) and is now 8lb out of the handicap, on top of latest 7lb rise.
Horse quote: 2025-03-22 at Newbury (23.5f): "King's Threshold had the tongue-tie on for the first time at Huntingdon and it made a big difference, so it's stayed on and helps him. The other thing is he is growing up. He's massive and it's taken him a long time to reach maturity. He's definitely going the right way and he stayed that trip well today. I wouldn't be looking to go further yet and he likes goodish, but not quick, ground - Emma Lavelle, trainer."

💬 Comment: Rather a free-going sort but he's been staying on admirably at the finish of late at 2m4f
🔦 Spotlight: 2lb out of the handicap; fell in his first two chases but has got his act together since and placed over the extended 2m4f when racing prominently at Cheltenham on last two outings; ridden by Sean O'Keeffe throughout chase career; stamina is a big question, particularly after he attempted 2m7f twice as a hurdler, and he's rather a free-going sort, but a hood (tried once) returns and he's been staying on admirably at the finish of late.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "O'Moore Park has run a blinder. He jumped well and stuck at it really well. I would say going up in trip will suit him. I had a nice position everywhere. I was following the winner and he was just very good on the day - Sean O'Keeffe, rider."

💬 Comment: 9-1 when carried out in the recent Scottish National but 6lb out of the handicap this time
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win was in France on debut, so he's now 0-13 for Willie Mullins and 0-9 over fences; clearly best effort came in the Scottish National on soft ground last year when about 8l sixth, coming from well off the pace (2lb higher today); penultimate outing gave some renewed hope, before he was unluckily carried out in the latest Scottish National when cheekpieces were added; just 9-1 that day but he's 6lb out of the handicap this time.

💬 Comment: Favourite for Scottish National but didn't settle in front and subsided into 7th; hood now
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 8yo; jumping was a major issue on his first two starts over fences but some improvement when he won a 2m4f beginners chase at Naas seven weeks ago, rallying extremely well; favourite for the Scottish National (4m) a fortnight ago but he didn't settle in front and subsided into seventh; today's hood could help with that and he may still bring potential.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D second before his Wincanton 3m3f win; Eider flop and he's now 7lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Emerged in second for London National over C&D (soft) in December and won from the front in the Somerset National at Wincanton (3m3f, good to soft) in January; flop in the Eider at Newcastle in February, while good ground may be a problem today; position 7lb out of the handicap certainly is.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Wincanton (26.5f): "We're delighted with Collectors Item. Maybe something like the Eider could suit him, but there are plenty of options. Kev gave him a lovely ride with plenty of positivity, which he responds quite well to. His jumping was better towards the end and he didn't put in any short ones - AJ O'Neill, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: Fourth and second in the last two Scottish Nationals; 12lb out of the handicap today
🔦 Spotlight: 0-14 since bumper win in 2022; fourth and second in the last two Scottish Nationals, latterly off a reduced mark when wearing second-time cheekpieces two weeks ago; while that was a welcome return to form, position 12lb out of the handicap today demands so much more; 5lb claimer is called up.
Horse quote: 2025-04-12 at Ayr (32f): "Klarc Kent ran a great race. He'd been out of form all season, but that means nothing with Willie [Mullins, trainer]. I thought he'd win at the last and he actually quickened and I thought 'we're away', but in the last half-furlong I could see the orange colours coming. But I was relieved it was one of Willie's - Jonathan Burke, jockey."

💬 Comment: Did not spark in the Grand National and good ground would give him more to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Dictated the pace for a Uttoxeter win (3m, soft; 3lb higher today) in February with second-time cheekpieces (kept since) in a less demanding race than he's often appeared in; 13l fourth in the Welsh National (near 3m7f, soft) was respectable but he did not spark in the big one at Aintree three weeks ago and good ground would give him more to prove.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Uttoxeter (24f): "Nick Scholfield gave Monbeg Genius a lovely ride and it's great to see him get the job done. The National weights are out Tuesday, so we'll see what happens there, but hopefully he'll get a run. He's good with cut in the ground but ran a nice race at Newbury last season. We've been waiting for this day with him as the form at Cheltenham worked out well. It's great to see him get his head in front - AJ O'Neill, joint-trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-03-05 at Thurles (16f): "Chosen Witness is a fine big horse. He can be a bit ignorant at one or two hurdles but he has loads of scope and should jump a fence - Sean O'Keeffe, rider."

💬 Comment: 5lb out of handicap; stuck on over 3m lately as if next reinvention could be as a stayer
🔦 Spotlight: 5lb out of the handicap; 9yo whose career has contained plenty of surprises and performing so manfully in 3m handicap chases on good ground at Ascot and this track on his last two starts is arguably one of them; that's nowhere near his old hurdles form but he's been sticking on as if his next reinvention could be as a stayer.
Horse quote: 2023-02-26 at Fontwell (19f): "Goshen's always hung but there are just so limited opportunities for him. We know we have to go right-handed on soft ground but there are literally no races for him. We took a punt and it didn't work out again. I'd say that's the last time [going left-handed] - Jamie Moore, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runaway winner of the Eider but well beaten in Midlands National; 15lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: First foray beyond 3m saw him win the Eider at Newcastle (4m1f, good to soft) in February eased down by 16l; raised 10lb when nowhere near repeating the dose as favourite for the Midlands National (4m2f, good to soft) six weeks ago and he's now an additional 15lb out of the handicap.
Horse quote: 2025-02-22 at Newcastle (33.5f): "Everyone who's ridden Knockanore says he wants further. He's a bit of a rogue, he's won very easily today and he's our best work horse by a country mile but he doesn't quite show it on the track all the time. He's shown it today - Ryan Potter, trainer."
