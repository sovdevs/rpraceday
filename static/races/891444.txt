🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising in 2 runs on testing ground in France; tongue tied for yard debut; check market
🔦 Spotlight: Unextended to win a 1m newcomers' maiden at Compiegne last May (heavy; front two pulled a long way clear); ✂️ gelded afterwards; no match for a useful sort at Chantilly (1m, very soft) in October and sold out of Andre Fabre's stable for 18,000gns in October; faster ground/penalty to contend with on his stable debut and a tongue tie is now fitted; betting instructive.

🔦 Spotlight: Cost 150,000gns at the Breeze Ups last April; 14-1 for his Newcastle debut three weeks ago (7f; wore a hood) and kept on steadily for fifth, beaten over 11l at the finish; could take a big step forward with that run behind him and tackling an extra furlong; hood off today.
