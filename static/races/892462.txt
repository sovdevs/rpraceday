💬 Comment: H'cap debut, showed promise over C&D, didn't get home latest, may be suited by shorter
🔦 Spotlight: Handicap debutant is one of two runners for yard; glimmers of promise in maidens, his best two efforts coming over C&D, though he didn't see the trip out when ridden positively here on latest; his dam won over 6f and his half-sister was best at 6f-7f; may be seen to best effect over shorter trips than this.
