🔦 Spotlight: Won handicap hurdle at this track early last year; and signed off last season with a promising third in a beginners' chase debut; moderate form on his first two starts this term; slotted into handicap company effectively when second at Fairyhouse six weeks ago; steps up in a class with fair prospects off a light weight.
