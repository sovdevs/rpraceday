🔦 Spotlight: Showed a combination of greenness and ability on his debut, but despite again running green he won a novice over this C&D with plenty of authority in January; this is harder, but he remains 🚀 open to further improvement and being proven under the conditions must count for something.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unraced for Godolphin; this looks a hot race in which to make his debut
🔦 Spotlight: Pinatubo gelding; picked up from Godolphin for 4,000gns in October; half-brother to winners Silver Jubilee (6f/1m including UAE dirt/Qatar; RPR 91) and Specialisation (8.6f AW; 82); unraced dam closely related to Listed winners Ferdoos (1m4f; dam of 1m2f Group 1 winner Nezwaah) and Brusco (14.5f/1m7f); this looks a hot race in which to make his debut; stable also runs fellow newcomer Maury.
