🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Emphatic win on handicap debut here (1m4f) ten days ago; major player back down in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Found stacks of improvement upped to 1m4f on handicap debut when justifying favouritism with 4l win here on his recent return (first run since ✂️ gelded); now drops back in trip but he travelled smoothly last time and he's a major player under a penalty.

🔦 Spotlight: Well held in her three qualifying runs and finished last of eight on handicap debut here (7f) in January; sold out of Jamie Osborne's yard for 2,000gns since; still early days but she went in snatches after a slow start last time and others are preferred; hood removed.

🔦 Spotlight: Tailed off at big prices in three runs last year and last two were at this track (8.6f); this is more realistic on handicap debut but she still needs plenty of improvement after 132 days off; first-time visor.
