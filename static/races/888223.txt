🔦 Spotlight: Placed in a couple of 3m points last year and ran his best race over hurdles when fourth of 14 at Wincanton (2m, soft) last month; steps up in trip on his handicap debut and has to be of interest.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 6yo who is respected now back on better ground for his handicap debut.
🔦 Spotlight: Held his own against subsequent winners in his final bumper and then finished second on hurdle debut at Warwick (2m, good); hasn't built on that, though Newbury was too bad to be true and likely that he was unsuited by soft ground when midfield behind the promising Palladium at Huntingdon; respected on his handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden winner; last of six finishers on handicap debut last time but not written off.
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark when sporting a first-time tongue-tie in a Uttoxeter maiden in October; raced keenly when last of six finishers at Wetherby (2m4f, good to soft) on handicap debut in December with hood removed (left off again here); still has potential off this mark.
