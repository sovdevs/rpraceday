🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7 runs, has best form in this thanks to Newbury Listed win (7f, heavy; 14-1) final start
🔦 Spotlight: 1,000 Guineas entry; with seven runs, she's seen far more action than these rivals but she brings the best form thanks to her Listed win at Newbury (7f; 14-1) on final start last term; that augurs well for 1m but was registered on heavy ground; this is AW debut.

💬 Comment: Newcastle win (7f, Tapeta) on second start; similar form to most of these and potential
🔦 Spotlight: Second foal of a 1m and Listed 1m1f winner; starting 11-10 favourite on debut at Newmarket (7f, soft) last October was not reflected in any way in her performance, but she was nevertheless 5-6 for a novice at Newcastle (7f, Tapeta) one month later and came from off the pace to win in tidy fashion; similar form to most of these and, like them, brings potential.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11-8 favourite for C&D maiden (7 ran) in December and made virtually all, hugely on top
🔦 Spotlight: 100,000gns yearling by Oasis Dream out of once-raced half-sister to 1m4f Group 1 winner Kitesurf; 11-8 favourite for seven-runner maiden over C&D in December and made virtually all, hugely on top through the final 2f; faces much more daunting opposition but that was a striking debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Knuckled down well to finish well on top in 2 AW novice events at about 1m, including here
🔦 Spotlight: Late foal who is closely related to six winners, two of them very useful; knuckled down well to finish well on top in AW novice events at Kempton (1m) and Wolverhampton (8.6f; at 8-15) in the autumn; something to find on form (giving at least 3lb all round) but she's promising.

🔦 Spotlight: Late foal; 7-1 and 3-1 when showing fair form in 6f maidens at Newbury (good) and Yarmouth (good to firm) last summer; she's therefore the only maiden in this field, with work to do, but she should improve this term.
