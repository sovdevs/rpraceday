📝 Comment: 🔄 held up in rear, some headway when not fluent 3 out, not fluent 2 out, hung left and outpaced approaching last, no impression run-in (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey stated that having run keenly in his previous races, his instructions were to drop in early, get settled and then ride race as he found it; he then added that gelding again ran freely off a slow early pace particularly on final circuit when amongst and around runner; he further added he was pleased with way gelding was travelling and felt he was in a good position to challenge turning for home but after a couple of tentative jumps at 3rd and 2nd last flights where he lost ground, he felt he did not respond to his one use of the whip after 2nd last and thereafter had ridden hands and heels to finish achieving his best possible placing on a horse that he considered was only plugging to the line fairly; he further added that gelding needs a step up in trip but this may not occur until such time as he learns to relax in his races as he currently not finishing 2m trip off strongly due to racing exuberantly; trainer stated he was satisfied with ride and that it accorded with instructions given)
