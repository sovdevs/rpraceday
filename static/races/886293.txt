🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dug deep to for 2m win here last month and has good 5lb claimer enlisted today
🔦 Spotlight: Tends to race a bit too freely but battled gamely to open chasing account here (2m, heavy; front pair clear) last month, his fifth start over fences; will be fine over today's longer trip and his recent 5lb rise if offset by Callum Pritchard's very useful claim; good chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Course winner over hurdles last season (2m3f, heavy) and made quite promising chase debut in December; yet to build on that performance but was in contention before bad jumping error seemed to knock the stuffing out of him in the straight here a fortnight ago (first-time visor); no surprise if he gets his act together over fences soon.

🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced 7yo who comfortably won Wetherby novice hurdle (2m, soft) in December; just a respectable fourth of six on recent chase/handicap debut at Carlisle (2m, soft) but today's longer trip is likely to suit him and he probably still has potential.
