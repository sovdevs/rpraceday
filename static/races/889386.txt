🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three-time winner; failed to justify favouritism at Newbury but against useful opposition
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a half-sister to the yard's top-class hurdler Epatante; dual bumper winner in France and wasn't overly troubled to make a successful hurdle/stable debut at Kempton (2m, good); failed to justify favouritism at Newbury (soft) but that was against respected opposition; every chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Conceding 5lb to a really smart prospect when runner-up in the Grade 2 Adonis
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Flat winner who has raised his profile over hurdles, winning the Scottish Triumph at Musselburgh (good to soft) before finishing runner-up in the Grade 2 Adonis at Kempton; he probably faced mission impossible that day in conceding 5lb to a really smart prospect; hard to beat.
