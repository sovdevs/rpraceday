🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Chelmsford and looked unlucky in her follow-up bid at Wolverhampton; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark (fifth attempt) when finishing well to land a Chelmsford handicap (7f) last month and she looked unlucky in her follow-up bid at Wolverhampton 17 days ago; only 1lb higher than for that near miss and she's a 🔥 big player if she gets the breaks.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well-bred filly and she looks a possible 🚀 improver on handicap debut; needs a close look
🔦 Spotlight: Well held when down the field in her three qualifying runs (7f/6f) but it's still early days for this well-bred filly and it wouldn't be a surprise if she showed a lot more on this handicap debut; needs close look after a short break.

🔦 Spotlight: Reached the frame in handicaps (6f-1m) in last three runs but he tends to be sluggish in the early stages of his races and is still a maiden after eight starts; new headgear now goes on and he needs to find more back in trip.
