🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Posted a more encouraging effort in the added blinkers last time; needs to back that up.
🔦 Spotlight: 0-19 (Flat/hurdles); posted a promising effort on stable debut over 1m2f at Lingfield in January; failed to build on that in her next two starts but then shaped encouragingly in first-time blinkers (retained) over 1m at Chelmsford in March; needs to back that up now switching to turf.
