🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never misses the first three when completing; easiest task in a hunter chase to date.
🔦 Spotlight: Flattered by the proximity when beaten just over a length by Fairly Famous at Horseheath in December, but a record of 25 first-three finishes from as many career completions (seven wins) is hard to knock; easiest task so far in a hunter chase for this enthusiastic front-runner; visored.

💬 Comment: Showed little at Charm Park on recent return; likelier one for later on this spring.
🔦 Spotlight: Winner in May the past two years, including a weak Huntingdon hunter chase in 2024 (good to soft); recent return at Charm Park may therefore have been needed, though didn't show sufficient to interest here even so.

🔦 Spotlight: All out to land the odds in a three-runner Kingston Blount grassroots conditions event last month (3m, soft), breaking a near six-year losing run; limitations have been exposed in hunter chases either side of that, though has placed over this C&D once before.

🔦 Spotlight: Garthorpe conditions success between the flags last month (2m4f, good to soft) was his first win since taking a C&D event here in Easter 2023 (soft); pulled up in a deeper running of this race last term, albeit on about as sound a surface as likely awaits him again today.
