🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reliable sort, albeit race didn't pan out ideally over 6f last time; claims back at 5f
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in October and a reliable yardstick who wasn't seen to best effect in a race that didn't suit those held up over 6f here last time; likely to give it best shot back in trip.
