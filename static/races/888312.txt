🔦 Spotlight: Cheekpieces were fitted on last four starts, which included 2m handicap wins at Uttoxeter by 15l (on soft) and a comfortable 3l (on good to soft); creditable third on heavy at Lingfield last time; 🎖️ major contender if he can serve up the same on the forecast good ground here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 9lb higher, including 7lb penalty, than for Fakenham win last week but on the shortlist
🔦 Spotlight: Dual 1m2f Flat winner who was runner-up in two of her first four starts over hurdles, before going one better in handicap at Fakenham (2m, good to soft) last Friday; needed some riding to come from the rear to justify favouritism in six-runner race that day but she was firmly in charge from the home turn; 9lb higher today, including 7lb penalty, but on the shortlist.
