🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Might have won a substandard Sefton with a better jump at the last flight
🔦 Spotlight: Brings substandard Sefton form but might have won that Aintree prize with a better jump at the final flight and it was only his second attempt in this sphere; still of interest.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Aintree (20f): "Mister Meggit is an amazing horse in that he doesn't show you anything at home but thank God he lights up when he comes racing ? the last one we really had like that was Synchronised [the 2012 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner] who also showed you nothing at home. The way he is over hurdles we'll stick with that for the moment ? he might not need to go chasing! We'll get over today and see, today was the plan and now we could look at something like the Challow Hurdle - Jonjo O'nNeill, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came up well short in the Turners but seems likely to do better still
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily over 2m on debut for Willie Mullins; came up well short in the Turners (2m5f) but seems likely to do better still; dam's side provides optimism upped further in trip.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "It was a match from when we jumped off and I had the better of that before the turn in. Kiss Will lengthened well up the straight and showed a little bit more of a turn of foot than I thought he would. He could definitely be an exciting horse going forward - Paul Townend, jockey."

💬 Comment: Finished second/third in Graded races the last twice; solid chance
🔦 Spotlight: One of three runners for Willie Mullins; completed a hat-trick (bumpers/hurdle) last year; finished second/third in Graded races over 3m/2m4f the last twice; solid chance.
Horse quote: 2024-11-30 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Ballygunner Castle had to overcome plenty from very early. He got a good bump at the start and I nearly fell off him at the first. I had to ride him on then and I made him do plenty throughout the race. There was no hiding places and it was messy up the straight but he still pulled out again. It's the sign of a good one. He will relax better, I had him lit up to take on his hurdles early today because of what happened at the first. He'll be fine, he's learning on the job - Paul Townend, rider"

💬 Comment: Good sixth at huge odds in the Albert Bartlett; could go well again
🔦 Spotlight: Belied his huge odds with a good effort in the Albert Bartlett, eventually weakening into sixth place having held every chance turning for home; could go well again.
Horse quote: 2024-11-20 at Ffos Las (20f): "Jig's Forge is a very laid-back individual at home, hence the reason we thought we'd bob along and keep it simple. He was actually very keen. He jumped very well for one of ours first time out on heavy ground, and he did well to win considering he was fairly enthusiastic early doors. I'd mark that down as quite a taking performance from a nice novice going forward. He looked like he went through the ground nicely, but I don't think he's short of speed and two and a half [miles] is where we'll stay for the moment. We've got time at this time of year to find our way to the better races without going too quickly. We'll take in a novice under a penalty and see what comes next - Ben Pauling, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Failed to show his form in the Albert Bartlett most recently; steadily 📈 progressive otherwise and has gained two of his four hurdles wins in Scotland; major player on ratings.
Horse quote: 2024-10-26 at Cheltenham (24f): "Intense Approach's jumping had been an issue but you wouldn't think it. Harry [Cobden] gets on very well with him and once he gave him a little flick he picked up nicely. That opens up options over three miles and he'll be a nice chaser too. I won this with Bardenstown Lad and then went to the Albert Bartlett and finished third so we could look at something in the spring. He wouldn't want Irish winter ground and he'll have to have a break - John McConnell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Runner-up in a substandard Sefton; beaten in a handicap the time before
🔦 Spotlight: Finished 50-1 second in a substandard Sefton at Aintree this month and that looks Grade 1 form in name only; beaten in a handicap the time before; not entirely solid.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Aintree (24.5f): "Minella Rescue was a little unlucky last time. We came here thinking that if everything went well for us, he may be top six. We thought 100/1 was a bit embarrassing, so the owners helped themselves to a bit of that. He wants good ground. Now it's out in the open - everyone knows about him. He's got three weeks left as a novice, so it's very tempting to go in a 0-120 novice, but Sean [Bowen] said he had a hard race today, so if he's ok, we'll run him again, and if he isn't, he'll have to wait and run in a handicap. We've got a little race mapped out for him at Galway, at the festival. His jumping's a bit sloppy to go chasing so that might be a bit of a slow burner. He's got a big engine, and that normally counts for most things - Gary Hanmer, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive but concedes weight all round and steps up markedly in distance
🔦 Spotlight: Has done his winning at about 2m, most recently in Grade 2 at Haydock (soft); 📈 progressive but faces a stiffer task off top weight in this field and now goes a mile further.
Horse quote: 2025-01-18 at Haydock (15.5f): "We know Dedicated Hero is a nice horse but today was about finding out how nice he is, and he was very good. I was niggling at the end of the straight because he found the track a bit sharp but he stayed on all the way to the line. I just hope Ruby Walsh wasn't watching because I dropped my whip. The original plan was the Premier Hurdle at Kelso as he's won twice there and then maybe Aintree - we haven't really talked about Cheltenham - Ryan Mania, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rallying third in Grade 2 a Haydock last time; could well rate higher still
🔦 Spotlight: Justified favouritism in second rules attempt and was a rallying third in Grade 2 at Haydock (3m) since; something to find on the figures but could well rate higher still.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Listed winner last summer but this is a stronger race for the grade
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful mare; bagged Listed honours last summer but this is a stronger race for the grade and she has shown no further progress since, notwithstanding a recent win.
Horse quote: 2024-07-30 at Galway (16.5f): "We had to step Gale Mahler up in grade to see what we had and she was very impressive. We can now go home and start making proper plans. She doesn't mind that ground, she'll handle slow ground but she wouldn't want winter-heavy ground. She is very straightforward and genuine. She is a very good mare and we can target some of the big races in the autumn and next spring - Adrian Keatley, trainer."
