🔦 Spotlight: Very progressive over hurdles and landed the Fighting Fifth on reappearance; deeply impressive at Kempton (2m, good to soft; Grade 2) on the switch to fences, easily beating notable rival Ballyburn and recording a notably huge RPR for a chase debutant; exciting novice and still unbeaten; looks set to emulate Sprinter Sacre and Altior who both landed this prize for Nicky Henderson en route to the Arkle.

💬 Comment: Impressively defied top weight in Windsor handicap last time; one of the main contenders
🔦 Spotlight: Solid and progressive in handicaps this term, producing form figures of 2121; impressively defied top weight at Windsor (2m, soft) most recently, recording a bare figure that makes him one of the main contenders on these terms; highly respected.
