💬 Comment: Still unbeaten; deeply impressive at Kempton (chase debut) most recently; exciting novice
🔦 Spotlight: Very 📈 progressive over hurdles and landed the Fighting Fifth on reappearance; deeply impressive at Kempton (2m, good to soft; Grade 2) on the switch to fences, easily beating notable rival Ballyburn and recording a notably huge RPR for a chase debutant; exciting novice and still unbeaten; looks set to emulate Sprinter Sacre and Altior who both landed this prize for Nicky Henderson en route to the Arkle.

🏠 Owner: Mrs J Donnelly
💬 Comment: Still unbeaten; deeply impressive at Kempton (chase debut) most recently; exciting novice
🔦 Spotlight: Very 📈 progressive over hurdles and landed the Fighting Fifth on reappearance; deeply impressive at Kempton (2m, good to soft; Grade 2) on the switch to fences, easily beating notable rival Ballyburn and recording a notably huge RPR for a chase debutant; exciting novice and still unbeaten; looks set to emulate Sprinter Sacre and Altior who both landed this prize for Nicky Henderson en route to the Arkle.

🔦 Spotlight: Made all (unchallenged) in this race 12 months ago when only two of the four runners finished; faces stiffer opposition this time round and although consistent since, his level is known, whereas some of these rivals are still improving.
