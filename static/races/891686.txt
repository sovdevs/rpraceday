💬 Comment: Useful on the Flat and was runner-up on hurdle debut at Stratford last month; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Useful dual Flat winner (1m2f) for Andrew Balding; back from a break on hurdling/stable debut at Stratford (2m, good) last month but he rallied well to finish runner-up behind a 1-5 shot; that was a promising effort and he could have a good future in this sphere.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairly useful on Flat and he looks interesting now switched to hurdling for Dan Skelton
🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 on the Flat, but he finished runner-up in a Newcastle handicap (1m) and Southwell novice (7f) in final two runs for Ed Dunlop; now switches to jumps after five months off but he's a half-brother to a hurdle winner and needs a close look on first run for Dan Skelton; has been ✂️ gelded and tongue-tie is added.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1m2f Flat winner but he's not progressed over hurdles so far; needs to raise his game
🔦 Spotlight: Made his breakthrough on the Flat in minor handicap at Nottingham (1m2f, soft) in October; came from off the pace to finish third on hurdling/stable debut at Taunton (2m, good to soft) in December but he's not gone on from that in two runs since; still early days in this sphere but he needs improvement back in a maiden.
