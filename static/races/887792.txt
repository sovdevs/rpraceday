🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this race in 2022, made a bright start to the season at Gowran, leading chance
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Ashdale Bob by a head in this event three years ago; won a pair of Grade 3 races over fences two seasons ago; never at his best in four-race campaign last season; gave a reassuring display when keeping on for second behind the 📈 progressive Rockys Diamond at Gowran last month; could be hard to beat if building on that.
