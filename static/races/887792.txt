💬 Comment: Won this race in 2022, made a bright start to the season at Gowran, leading chance
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Ashdale Bob by a head in this event three years ago; won a pair of Grade 3 races over fences two seasons ago; never at his best in four-race campaign last season; gave a reassuring display when keeping on for second behind the 📈 progressive Rockys Diamond at Gowran last month; could be hard to beat if building on that.

💬 Comment: Much better known as a chaser, has been running in cross-country races, limited appeal
🔦 Spotlight: Won the 2022 Kerry National; only win in the interim was in a staying handicap on the Flat at Galway last year; last two outings have been in cross-country races; unlikely to feature on this rare hurdles venture.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran well in smart company the season before last, including when second to Blazing Khal in this event; needed his run at Punchestown after a year and a half off; showed that he retains considerably ability when winning a 2m4f Limerick conditions race as the outsider of five; could go close.
