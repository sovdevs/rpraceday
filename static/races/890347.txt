💬 Comment: 5lb lower than when winning over C&D last August; likely to find conditions similar
🔦 Spotlight: Ordinary form on the AW during the winter but he is 5lb lower than when winning over C&D (good to firm) last August and likely to find conditions similar; highly respected.
Horse quote: 2024-08-08 at Brighton (12f): "Lexington Knight can be a enigmatic character. It sometimes depends which side of bed he gets out of but once he decides it's a going day, it's on. His ears were flat back at the start of the race like he didn't want to know, but he's a street fighter like Mike Tyson - if he decides he wants to go ahead of another horse, like he did in the last few furlongs, he's determined not to get beaten. He's struck up a real rapport with Joe - they seem to understand each other. Maybe Joe goes down to his stable in the morning and knows which side of the bed Lexington Knight has got out off before he puts his silks on! We won this race two years ago with Fairmac in the stewards' room, so it's great to win it now comprehensively. The team at Richard's seem to have found the key to him and these sorts of horses are worth their weight in gold - Tim Palin, racing director for Middleham Park."
