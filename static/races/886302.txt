🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Progressing well; drew 6l clear when upped to an extended 2m4f at Huntingdon; up 9lb
🔦 Spotlight: Progressing well in this second season, winning two of his four handicaps and placed in the others; both wins were at Huntingdon, drawing 6l clear in 14-runner race last time when upped from 2m to an extended 2m4f; 9lb rise in a higher class demands better still but he's heading the right way.

💬 Comment: Won over about 2m1f in a maiden and Taunton handicap; shaped as if he'd stay further
🔦 Spotlight: Big 🚀 improver graduating from bumpers to hurdle races this term, on last two starts winning a maiden at Exeter (extended 2m, soft) and 14-runner handicap at Taunton (2m1f, soft); up 5lb but may have had more in hand than the winning margin suggests last time, shaping also as if he'd stay further.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a maiden here in 2023; also made all for 8l win at Market Rasen (good) in October and perhaps not being able to lead helps to explain lesser shows in his other two handicaps, with a heavy defeat in valuable race at Windsor (soft) on latest; unraced beyond the extended 2m1f of that Market Rasen win but looks bred to stay.
