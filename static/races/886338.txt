🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Now 3-3 over C&D; strong-finishing 3rd over 6f here latest; not weighted out of it
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of all three C&D starts, the most recent two in January, and value for a 4lb rise for the latest one; had no trouble with the drop to 6f here since, far from it as he was hard to restrain, and did good late work into third; unlikely to be weighted out of it back at 7f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came well clear at Lingfield (7f) latest; back up 7lb and lesser Tapeta form so far
🔦 Spotlight: Drew clear to win in fine style at Lingfield (7f) 24 days ago and going back up 7lb is less of a worry than the return to Tapeta as he's yet to win on the surface and hasn't run here since a sole attempt four years ago; clearly in prime form though so shortlisted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two C&D wins in 2023; slow start for yard but well treated now and promising 4th latest
🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins in 2023; made a slow start for this yard in October but he's well treated and the signs were better in January when coming from off the pace to take a late fourth (about 1m); of more interest now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Path hasn't been smooth in handicaps over further but looks worth another go at 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Justified short odds in 1m Lingfield novice in September; the path hasn't been smooth in handicaps but she ran well for a long way here (about 1m1f) two starts ago and 1m2f stretched her next time; looks worth another go at 7f but this is competitive.

💬 Comment: Multiple AW winner for different yards, latest in December; never involved over C&D since
🔦 Spotlight: Multiple AW winner for different yards, including at Lingfield (1m) in December for this one; however, he couldn't get into the action in first C&D run for two years on latest which leaves him with something to prove.

🔦 Spotlight: Won 7f Kempton novice for the Crisfords as 2yo; found some form again when a close third over 1m at Newcastle two starts ago before having a tough task next time; needs to show he still has what it takes at 7f.
