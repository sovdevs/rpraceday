🔦 Spotlight: Several minor honours and one very close call (1m2f here in 2023) but he remains a maiden after 25 races, 21 of which were on AW; latest start was over 9.4f and that's the shortest trip he's raced over, so 1m is unexplored; visor (tried once, tailed off) returns instead of usual cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Both wins were over 7f in 2023, latterly at this track; opposable on most 1m performances but she did go close over C&D last January and made some encouraging late headway when second favourite in a 7f classified here on latest outing; considered.
