🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Expensive point recruit, weakened first two Rules' starts, could do better on this ground
🔦 Spotlight: Won a good ground point-to-point at Dromahane and subsequently bought for 310,000 euros at Punchestown; has weakened late on in both starts in bumpers on yielding ground; might see out his race better on this sounder surface and he can't be discounted for his in-form stable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jukebox Jury mare, related to bumper winners, worth a 📊 market check on debut
🔦 Spotlight: Ninth foal; half-sister to winners Shanches (bumper) and Out Of Africa (point); dam placed bumper/2m hurdles, half-sister to winners Prominent Profile (useful bumper/2m2f-3m hurdle/chase) and Back Me Up (bumper/2m-2m4f hurdle); daughter of Jukebox Jury is worth a 📊 market check for a yard that had a 40-1 debutant finish third in a bumper at Fairyhouse in January.
