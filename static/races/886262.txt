🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful hurdler; fair start to chase career at Musselburgh 18 days ago; may do better
🔦 Spotlight: Useful handicap hurdler for Gary Moore in his prime; tailed off in Greatwood Hurdle at Cheltenham on stable debut in November  but made a reasonable start to his chase career when fifth of ten at Musselburgh (2m, good to soft) 18 days ago; entitled to come on for that outing and has spent most of his handicap career in much higher grades than this.
