💬 Comment: Improved run by run as a 2yo; step up in trip should suit now handicapping; 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Improved run by run as a 2yo, just failing against a promising sort at Newcastle in December (albeit had the benefit of experience) before winning at Wolverhampton 128 days ago (8.6f); stepping up in trip should prompt improvement and this isn't a strong race for the grade; leading claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked to find 1m too sharp here last month; bred for this trip and not fully exposed
🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each of his first three 2yo runs, getting off the mark at Thirsk in September (7f, good to soft); looked to find 1m an inadequate test here on his reappearance 17 days ago (first run since a gelding operation) and can do better over today's longer trip.
Horse quote: 2024-09-16 at Thirsk (7f): "Watching Stars is a rhythm horse, he'll stay. By the way he moves, he probably wouldn't want it too soft but he's been improving at home and he's learning on the job - Dougie Costello, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1m maiden win on AW in March; placed in two 1m2f handicaps since; ⬆️ up in class
🔦 Spotlight: Capitalised on a good opportunity at Lingfield on his seasonal return (1m, AW; ✂️ gelded after 2yo career); placed in both runs in 1m2f handicaps since and on a feasible mark; this represents a step ⬆️ up in class though.
Horse quote: 2025-03-05 at Lingfield (AW) (8f): "Lightening Mann will improve lots too. He's still got to iron out a few things, but we've always liked him, and after running at Doncaster in July last year we gelded him and gave him a break with this year in mind - Jack Channon, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-09-28 at Newmarket (7f): "Naina is well balanced and won a 20,000GBP seller on the July course so we knew she'd handle the track. She then went to Yarmouth and won again and loves this ground. She could well end up in a pattern race abroad - John Ryan, trainer."
