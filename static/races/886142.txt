🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Goes well in the mud; 3-3 over fences this season, with the last two wins coming over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Won final hurdle start last March and he's 3-3 over fences this season, with the last two wins coming over C&D on soft and the previous two were on heavy; up another 5lb and has had to work hard, but this lightly raced 6yo has been firmly on the upgrade.

💬 Comment: Beaten 30l on chase debut, over just 2m4f but he now needs to surge back to his best
🔦 Spotlight: Chance on hurdles form at this sort of trip on soft (unraced on heavy) but he's run in only the one chase, when 22-1 and beaten 30l at Warwick three weeks ago; that was over just 2m4f but he now needs to surge back to his best.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent hurdle results suggest he needs to find a bit extra and this is his chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: First-time cheekpieces (kept since) when winning easily at Wincanton (3m, heavy) last March; has run off much higher marks since and ran well when third on two of his three outings this term, all over about 3m on soft; they suggest he needs to find a bit extra and this is his chase debut.

💬 Comment: Goes well in the mud; 3-3 over fences this season, with the last two wins coming over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Won final hurdle start last March and he's 3-3 over fences this season, with the last two wins coming over C&D on soft and the previous two were on heavy; up another 5lb and has had to work hard, but this lightly raced 6yo has been firmly on the upgrade.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three backward steps this season but he's fine under these conditions if back on song
🔦 Spotlight: Disqualified winner last January and edged home in front over fences at Chepstow last April off 3lb higher; the last time he scored away from Chepstow was four years ago and he's taken three backward steps (two over fences; tried 3m7f last time) this season, but he's fine under these conditions if back on song.

💬 Comment: Used to be smart; way down the weights but this 11yo is hard to latch on to at the moment
🔦 Spotlight: Smart at his best but ended his time in Ireland looking a shadow of his former self and that has continued for 🆕 new yard; way down the weights but this 11yo is hard to latch on to at the moment.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent hurdle results suggest he needs to find a bit extra and this is his chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: First-time cheekpieces (kept since) when winning easily at Wincanton (3m, heavy) last March; has run off much higher marks since and ran well when third on two of his three outings this term, all over about 3m on soft; they suggest he needs to find a bit extra and this is his chase debut.

💬 Comment: Beaten 30l on chase debut, over just 2m4f but he now needs to surge back to his best
🔦 Spotlight: Chance on hurdles form at this sort of trip on soft (unraced on heavy) but he's run in only the one chase, when 22-1 and beaten 30l at Warwick three weeks ago; that was over just 2m4f but he now needs to surge back to his best.

🔦 Spotlight: No impact in first three runs switched to chasing but he was markedly better when coming from the rear for a C&D win (heavy) off reduced mark 11 days ago; back up 4lb but still 6lb below his peak hurdles mark; player.
