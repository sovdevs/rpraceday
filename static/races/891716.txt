🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Irish point, a course bumper (good) and 2m4f novice hurdle; handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who's since won a course bumper (good) and an Ayr novice hurdle (2m4f, soft), overturning the hot but below-par favourite (who ran a cracker in a Grade 1 since) on the latter occasion; versatile ground-wise and he's an interesting newcomer to handicaps.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never better than for 2m5f novice win (good) in October; excuse in November; off since
🔦 Spotlight: Hurdling for nearly three years and never better than in the autumn, when coming clear in 2m5f Kelso novice (good) in October; found out by the combination of 3m and the switch to Listed company when last seen in November but she can't be left out back in a handicap.
Horse quote: 2024-07-26 at Kilbeggan (19f): "Jumping Susie is learning how to win now. She is consistent and got a lovely ride. She jumps very well and I'm looking forward to her over fences - John McConnell, traine"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2024 was a washout but clear winner (2m4f) following wind op; up 12lb in stronger race
🔦 Spotlight: Flat ability in Ireland as 3yo (RPR 80) and won a juvenile hurdle that year; 2024 was a washout but she readily came clear at Sedgefield (2m4f, good; cheekpieces added) on second run for yard and first since wind surgery; up 12lb in a better race but it might not be beyond her.
Horse quote: 2023-11-16 at Sedgefield (17f): "Feach Amach had a promising run at Fontwell in August but things didn't go the way we hoped last time. However, she was fit and well today and Lorcan gave her a fantastic ride. The other horse jinked but I think she still would have got there - Paul Willis, owner."

🔦 Spotlight: Both hurdle wins at 2m (good to soft and soft) in November 2023; lightly raced with mixed results since but she can go well fresh and the pick of her form at about this trip gives her claims.
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Ayr (16f): "It's good to finally get a run into Little Miss Dante and it was a really nice performance. She wants slower ground and a bit further but she's a lovely mare and will hopefully carry on progressing. I hope she'll be out again in better company before too long as she's one we've always loved. She's definitely one to look forward to - Olly Murphy, trainer."

💬 Comment: Suited by 2m4f when winning at Musselburgh; pulled up (2m) since; this trip suits better
🔦 Spotlight: Suited by 2m4f at Musselburgh (good to soft) in February, when the cause looked lost but she kept on gamely to beat a subsequent winner, leading near the line; disappointing when pulled up over 2m next time, considering she'd run well over the trip in January; remains of interest back at 2m4f.
Horse quote: 2025-02-16 at Musselburgh (20f): "The second horse has went off at a good distance but, to be honest, I was in behind a few so I just rode a race. I used Danny [McMenamin] on the third as a tow and I hoped the horse in front would tie up and he did. She jumped really well and is genuine - Craig Nicol, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Hurdle winner in France; not looked well treated in Britain; switch from soft may suit
🔦 Spotlight: Sole hurdle win in France during 2023; has not looked well treated since trained in Britain and she found little at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in February; this first experience of good ground might improve matters.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest win last April; down the field latest; prefers good to soft/soft; now tongue tied
🔦 Spotlight: Most recent win was last April but she put up some good efforts at 2m1f-2m5f until soundly beaten returned to a handicap last month; perhaps other days as best form on good to soft/soft; now tongue tied.
Horse quote: 2024-04-05 at Musselburgh (20f): "We started Sunday Soldier off over this trip thinking she needed it and she wasn't seeing it out. But I think that was due to weakness. She's got stronger and done nothing but improve. David Killahena, joint-trainer."
