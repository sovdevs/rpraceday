🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sister to top-class Cracksman; entitled to improve and should appreciate the stiffer test
🔦 Spotlight: Sister to top-class Cracksman; ran below market expectations on her soft-ground debut last autumn; similarly, better was expected on her comeback when well off the front pair at Newbury (1m2f, good), but she's entitled to improve and should appreciate the stiffer test again.
