💬 Comment: Course winner; good effort at Newbury last time behind one who got loose on the lead
🔦 Spotlight: In a first-time hood when much too good for his two rivals over C&D last month and then ran well under a penalty at Newbury (2m7f) when unable to reel in an 🔍 unexposed winner who got loose on the lead; big shout off just 1lb higher.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3m3f winner earlier in season; on a competitive mark for trainer recognised in race title
🔦 Spotlight: Won over 3m3f earlier in the season and would prefer further ideally, but this is an easier race than Kempton's big February handicap over 3m he contested last time; on a competitive mark for trainer recognised in the race title.
Horse quote: 2022-11-11 at Cheltenham (20f): "I loved the way Unanswered Prayers jumped. He's a three-mile chaser in the making and might well need some headgear in time to keep his mind on the job. He'd have loved a bit of company and looked around a bit on the run-in - Chris Gordon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three chase runs; went close at Leicester but well beaten on either side of that
🔦 Spotlight: Effective at 2m1f-3m; won six times in the space of seven starts as a hurdler which scuppered his handicap mark; only had three runs over fences, going close at Leicester last month but well beaten on either side of that; others are safer.
Horse quote: 2024-10-30 at Newton Abbot (17f): "I'm delighted with Major Fortune and Catch Him Derry [his two winners]. They won a few races each last year. I thought they'd both need the run today and this was the first chance I've had to run them on some slower ground because it's been flooded down here the last few meetings. They were both very much suited by the ground, but hopefully they can continue to improve. It's early season form on a testing surface so I'm not sure what we'll do with them next, but they're going the right way - Dan Skelton, trainer."

💬 Comment: Just one run of note for this yard following a long absence; now tries cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Formerly with Willie Mullins; had four runs for this yard following a long absence, easily the best when beaten 5l over nearly 3m at Musselburgh in February (good to soft); looking hard to predict and now tries cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2022-09-05 at Galway (16.5f): "Hubrisko jumped well and loves that ground. He quickened well and quickened again up the hill which is a good sign - Paul Townend, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Respected on his second here in December; just one run since when off his game
🔦 Spotlight: 5-12 over hurdles; pulled up in his second chase three months ago but had previously pushed a solid yardstick close over 2m3f here (good to soft) in December and that form offers him a chance; never excelled at this sort of trip over hurdles but there's stamina in the pedigree.
Horse quote: 2023-04-21 at Ayr (20.5f): "That was a good performance, Hugos New Horse is an improving young horse and is very strong late on in a race. He's won on all sorts of ground and ran well in the EBF Final last time. He'd had a setback ten days before and he probably wasn't quite at his best and I thought he'd go very well again today. He's in tomorrow and I haven't totally ruled out running him, we'll see how he is - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Current wellbeing is a worry and Harry Skelton is on the yard's other one
🔦 Spotlight: Nothing good to take out of his last three races, though the last two were over 2m4f and his last win was at 3m3f (off 1lb lower last summer); has the form to take a hand but current wellbeing is a worry and Harry Skelton is on the yard's other one.
Horse quote: 2022-12-09 at Cheltenham (25.5f): "Hidden Heroics jumped nicely, although he was a little bit out to his right. I ran him at Aintree at the start of the season and we dropped him in and he ran like a hippo with a hernia. It was awful. We said we will make the running over fences now and he is 2-2 and hasn't come off the bridle twice. We will find some more novice handicaps. I'm not going to step up dramatically in grade at the moment but come the spring time we might look at something like a Scottish Grand National - Dan Skelton, trainer."
