🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in Wetherby bumper in February but seemingly overlooked by Sean Bowen here
🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame on Irish point debut and in both subsequent bumpers, more recently when second at Wetherby (soft) in February; should have a future over hurdles but seemingly overlooked by Sean Bowen.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not seen since going close at Doncaster in March 2023 but still an interesting contender
🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced since Listed bumper win in 2021 but went close over hurdles at Doncaster (2m, good) on latest outing in March 2023 and Ciaran Gethings might well have had the pick of yard's four runners.
Horse quote: 2021-03-13 at Sandown (16f): "Flirtatious Girl had improved at home but I felt the track here would suit her better than at Huntingdon as all she did was stay that day. I was slightly concerned the ground might be too soft for her but I don't think I've come across a mare as tough as her. We will get on and school her now before she goes out to grass. We won't be going to Aintree - Kim Bailey, trainer."
