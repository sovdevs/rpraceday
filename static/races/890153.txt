🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lots to find with Arizona Blaze but can be in the mix if that rival fails to run his race
🔦 Spotlight: Much-improved since switching to AW, winning a C&D maiden and a conditions race last autumn; has plenty to find with Arizona Blaze but should be in the mix if that rival fails to run his race.

💬 Comment: Needs her stablemate to run well below form to have a winning chance
🔦 Spotlight: Seems to be the yard's second-string; kept busy last year for former yard, winning once and running respectably in Group 3 company; not a bad handicap run for this yard last time but needs her stablemate to run well below form to have a winning chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Sixth foal; half-sister to 1m2f AW 2yo winner Eagles Dare (RPR 68); dam unraced half-sister to Listed winners Malakeh (German 1m) and Smokey Storm (6f 2yo); will need to be above average to take this on debut so is likely best watched.
