🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His third win at Fontwell ten days ago when 7lb lower; in form but unraced here
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time Flat winner and winning for a third time over hurdles when coming 5l clear at Fontwell (2m1f, good) on his second start after an absence; raised 7lb for that and, although particularly effective at Fontwell, he's unraced here.
Horse quote: 2022-03-12 at Lingfield (AW) (12f): "The step up in trip has helped He's A Latchico he hits a flat spot but stayed on well in the straight when I got a nice split - Rhys Clutterbuck, jockey."

💬 Comment: The handicapper doesn't appear to have taken any chances but he's an 🔍 unexposed 4yo
🔦 Spotlight: Showed ability in France; still very lightly raced; probably didn't have to improve on his Taunton third to make all in a C&D maiden (good) in which the favourite gave himself no chance; the handicapper doesn't appear to have taken any chances but he's an 🔍 unexposed 4yo with the weight allowance.

🔦 Spotlight: 9.4f AW winner; granted time after his fall at Uttoxeter in December and returned with a clearcut win at Hexham (2m, good to soft); handicapper hit back with a 7lb rise and this is a higher grade, but respected nonetheless.

🔦 Spotlight: Beaten about 11l in his one handicap, after which he was close up in a Southwell maiden (2m, good to soft); might be on a high mark unless improving for a wind operation.

🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner on Flat and over hurdles; won by a comfortable 3l at Warwick two runs back (2m, good) but rather typically ran below that level at Southwell latest; capable of running well off this mark but he's not one for maximum faith.
Horse quote: 2023-04-08 at Haydock (15.5f): "All credit for this goes to Josh (Moore), he was adamant we should come up here with Aggagio today. He gave me my instructions, to pop him out and be very positive on him, and it's worked - Caoilin Quinn, rider."
