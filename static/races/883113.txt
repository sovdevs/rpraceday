üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: 3-3 hurdling, with wide-margin wins in Grade 2 races here on last two; sets good standard
üî¶ Spotlight: Developed into a useful stayer on the Flat for James Fanshawe and has created an excellent impression in winning his three starts over hurdles; led after two out when he stormed 18l clear in a Grade 2 here in November (good) and made most to score by 10l in another Grade 2 here seven weeks ago (soft); very much sets the standard and it's a good one.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Won at Auteuil; major reputation preceded his highly promising win at Ascot on yard debut
üî¶ Spotlight: Green when 5l winner at Auteuil (2m2f, heavy) in October on sole French start; already backed into favouritism for this race when he made stable debut at Ascot (near 2m, good) eight weeks ago, looking edgy beforehand but professional in the race and produced late on to assert with plenty in hand from Mondo Man; that's not the best form but it was a performance of high promise.

üí¨ Comment: Unbeaten on Flat and in two Graded races as hurdler; travelled much the best in Gr1 latest
üî¶ Spotlight: Unbeaten in his two Flat starts (useful prospect at least) and two over hurdles; Grade 2 at Leopardstown (yielding) was hurdle debut, leading before the last and holding on by short head from Lady Vega Allen; hooded for Grade 1 there (soft) six weeks ago and travelled much the best to lead at the last, with Lady Vega Allen (third) again staying on; has the best form among the Irish, a more strongly run race may well suit and he leaves the strong impression of hidden reserves.

üí¨ Comment: Flat class; needs to settle; stronger pace in this should assist, as might the new hood
üî¶ Spotlight: Classy on Flat, finishing fifth in French Derby and fourth at Royal Ascot; left France for 520,000euros and, despite racing far too freely, he briefly asked a question of Lulamba on hurdling debut at Ascot (good); 5-6 at Kempton (good to soft) five weeks later when held up last but he again fought for his head and never quite got to grips with the front two; a more settled display should help him no end and a stronger pace in this race should assist that, as might the new hood.

üî¶ Spotlight: Three wins and a Listed second in four Flat races (up to 1m2f) in France; fetched 315,000euros in July and next seen when 10-11 in a 16-runner maiden at Naas (2m, soft to heavy) in January, in which he helped set the early pace and went on before final flight, despite looking green; should improve (particularly given Flat form) but the Naas form still leaves him with plenty to find.

üî¶ Spotlight: French Flat winner (1m2f, heavy) who won easily on his hurdle debut at Wetherby (2m, good to soft) in November; however, no match for the winner when second in Grade 2 at Chepstow (2m, soft) next time and disappointing from the front behind Gibbs Island at Haydock latest, so he's up against it.
