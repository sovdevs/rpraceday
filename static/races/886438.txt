🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Slowly away/soundly beaten on debut but this 125,000euros breezer could be a lot sharper
🔦 Spotlight: Slowly away and beaten nearly 8l when fourth of ten on last month's debut at Wolverhampton (8.6f, Tapeta); however, he was sent off the warm 11-8 favourite and this 125,000euros breeze-up buy could be a lot sharper today.

💬 Comment: 75,000gns yearling with a useful pedigree; not ruled out on debut
🔦 Spotlight: 75,000gns yearling; 12th foal; half-brother to six winners notably Endless Time (1m-1m6f including AW/Group 2), Red October (1m-1m4f including AW; RPR 95) and The Sky Is Blazing (1m AW; 94); this Ghaiyyath colt may need a longer trip in future but he's not ruled out on debut.

🔦 Spotlight: 4yo who was well beaten at 25-1 on debut at Sandown (1m2f, good to soft) last April and absent since; plenty to prove but this 100,000euros yearling has an attractive pedigree and could take a big step forward at some stage.
