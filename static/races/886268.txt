🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner; now 0-7 over hurdles but has gradually been getting closer in handicaps, finishing second of 17 at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) five weeks ago; that form has been franked and his 3lb rise is more than offset by Callum Pritchard's claim; considered.

💬 Comment: Potential 🚀 improver in handicap hurdle but not seen for 407 days; betting should guide
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time AW Flat winner in the first half of 2023 and he showed hurdle promise last winter before going missing after January; possible 🚀 improver now handicapping for the first time in this sphere but the betting is perhaps the best guide after over a year off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Long absence but placed off higher marks and his yard is in form; worth a betting check
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time Flat winner and also runner-up twice in 2m handicap hurdles in summer 2022; not seen since a below-par run in October of that year but returns with the stable in form and Sam Twiston-Davies takes the ride; worth a second look in the betting.
