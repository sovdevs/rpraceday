💬 Comment: Up 5lb for 5.5l win at Clonmel, drop back to 2m fine but previous course form a worry
🔦 Spotlight: 2-29 over hurdles, that second win coming by 5.5l off 95 at Clonmel (18.5f, good) two weeks ago; 5lb rise for that seems fair and the drop to 2m is fine but she hasn't produced her best in four previous runs at this venue.

💬 Comment: Placed here over 19.5f off 12lb higher last May, 2m may be too sharp, place claims
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner (rated 90) is 0-17 over hurdles; has run well at this venue before, including a 0.75l second off 109 over 19.5f last May; now rated 97 so well treated on that form but 2m might be a bit sharp for him on the evidence of his latest run at Cork (Who's In Midfield 0.5l behind); place claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed here over 19.5f off 12lb higher last May, 2m may be too sharp, place claims
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner (rated 90) is 0-17 over hurdles; has run well at this venue before, including a 0.75l second off 109 over 19.5f last May; now rated 97 so well treated on that form but 2m might be a bit sharp for him on the evidence of his latest run at Cork (Who's In Midfield 0.5l behind); place claims.
