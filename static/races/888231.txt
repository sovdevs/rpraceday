🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made winning stable debut at Southwell and second over fences at Bangor; plenty of appeal
🔦 Spotlight: Made a successful stable debut at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) last month (runner-up won next time); couldn't quite take advantage of his lower chase mark at Bangor nine days later and 6lb higher than at Southwell, but he still makes plenty of appeal back over hurdles.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointing on soft ground last time, but has won well on good ground the time before
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who comfortably made a successful handicap debut over hurdles at Fontwell (2m5f, good) in November; beaten a long way into third of six there (2m3f, soft; 6-4) the following month, but the likely good ground here may bring about a resurgence.

💬 Comment: Better when fifth at Doncaster 13 days ago; shaped as though he would appreciate further
🔦 Spotlight: Hooded all four starts; twice well held after going close on his Thurles debut (2m, good) in November, but showed more when fifth of 14 on his second start for this yard (handicap debut) at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) 13 days ago; shaped then as though he would appreciate further; interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner; shaped as though worth another go over this far last time
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't built on his Ludlow bumper success (good) in October 2023, but he didn't run badly when fourth of 11 at Lingfield (2m, heavy) last month (winner has gone in again since); shaped as though worth another go over this far and not dismissed.
