🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Highly 📈 progressive at 7f on Tapeta before return to sprinting didn't work out latest
🔦 Spotlight: The return to 6f didn't come off at Southwell last month (minus regular tongue-tie, now refitted) but he'd found his niche in 7f handicaps on Tapeta earlier, adding to two C&D wins with a cosy one at Southwell; should cope with 5lb rise if the sprint experiment hasn't unsettled him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of sorts but more promising at Kempton latest; all eight AW wins on that track
🔦 Spotlight: Out of sorts this winter but he's well treated now and his latest Kempton run was more promising; has done his AW winning, at 7f and 6f, on that track though and a winning revival is most likely to come back there.

🔦 Spotlight: Ended his latest campaign with heavy defeats, following a 1m2f classified win at Brighton in August; has no great fondness for the AW and he looks unlikely back from a break over an inadequate trip.
