🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner, second here last month, down in trip with hood and tongue-tie, good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Beat subsequent dual bumper scorer Seo Lin at Ballinrobe last May; made a bad mistake three out when fourth behind stablemate Kaid D'Authie in a 2m4f maiden at Leopardstown in December; better effort when second to subsequent Grade 3 winner Ballybow over an extended 2m2f here last time; shorter trip should be fine; hood and tongue-tie added.
