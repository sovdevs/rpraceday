🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back to form (well backed) when 2nd at Thirsk recently; 3lb higher but still a key player
🔦 Spotlight: It's been a long time since his last win but he retains ability and would have gone even closer at Thirsk nine days ago (7f, good; well backed) but for having to wait for a gap at a crucial stage; 3lb rise for that effort asks a tougher question but returning to a mile should be fine and he's one to take seriously.
Horse quote: 2022-06-25 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "Rhythm Master has been a bit of a rogue. We had to relieve him of his manhood, we tried the visor today and it made the world of difference - John Dance, owner."

🔦 Spotlight: Two AW wins (7f) in December; well beaten on first two handicap runs (1m, Tapeta) but beaten under one length into third at Doncaster three weeks ago (7f, good); 2lb higher mark to deal with today and still to prove he wants this far.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a dangerous mark and shaped as though in need of the run here two weeks ago; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Not prolific in recent years but 1m on fast ground holds no terrors and he's 2lb lower than for a good third in a big-field Class 2 handicap at York last October; looked as though the run would bring him on when fifth over C&D two weeks ago on his return to action; one for the shortlist.
Horse quote: 2022-04-06 at Nottingham (8.5f): "Barley probably needed the run at Doncaster, not from a fitness point of view but to wake him up as he's very laid-back. We got a really soft lead today and were able to dictate. He's a lovely-looking horse and has a good attitude. He'll stay further and be better in a better race, where I think he'd be able to show his full potential - Rob Hornby, jockey."

💬 Comment: Drops in trip for h'cap debut; beaten fav last twice; interesting to see if backers return
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo; started out in a bumper in October before going down narrowly at Newcastle (1m2f) on Flat debut a fortnight later; beaten favourite both runs since (1m4f and 1m2f); drops in trip for his handicap debut but he's an exuberant sort and could benefit from it; interesting to see if his backers return.

💬 Comment: Two 7f wins last summer; dangerous mark but it was a low-key return here two weeks ago
🔦 Spotlight: Won second time out last season before going on to win a handicap at the Galway festival (both 7f); stable has had a couple of winners in this race since 2016 but his reappearance effort two weeks ago will need leaving well behind.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No history of going well fresh and looks best watched on his return
🔦 Spotlight: Capable on his day but he's still 2lb higher than for his last success and he has no history of going well fresh.
Horse quote: 2023-07-25 at Musselburgh (7f): "The race didn't set up the way we thought as Joe (Fanning) got to the front and slowed up a bit but Yaaser did it well, he ran as straight as a gun-barrel up the straight. The last time here we probably played too early and we've learnt from that, the more you take him back the more he comes back on the bit. I think you could even play him later as he has a good turn of foot - Jim Goldie, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."
