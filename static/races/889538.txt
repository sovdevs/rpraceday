🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't progress in three 6f AW/turf starts for Rae Guest last year, but should do better
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't progress in three 6f maiden/novices for Rae Guest last year, but best run came on the AW first time up (finished one place behind a subsequent winner); fair chance she'll build on that now fresh again, back on the AW and handicapping at a lowly level.
