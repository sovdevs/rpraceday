🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-5 in bumpers, fine effort to land Grade 2 Aintree race after a winter break, big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of three of her five starts; Ballinrobe winner last May on second outing; fair fourth in a Listed bumper at Gowran in October; scored readily at Cheltenham in November and produced in fine shape to land Grade 2 mares' event at Aintree, ridden by Billy Lee on both occasions, a top amateur aboard now.
Horse quote: 2025-04-03 at Aintree (17f): "That was very good. I think Seo Linn will be a good filly on the Flat. There's a good staying programme for her there and we'll look at that. She seemed to be enjoying herself - we came here hoping she was ready to do her thing, and she was. She's grown up - she was a little bit fractious at Cheltenham, but she's learning and she's going and she's improving - Paddy Twomey, trainer."

💬 Comment: Only a nose behind Carrigmoornaspruce at Fairyhouse, strong chance if settling better
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point-to-point for Denis Murphy last season; subsequently bought for 150,000GBP; made all at Fairyhouse on bumper debut; well held in fifth behind stablemate Bambino Fever when ridden by Patrick Mullins in the Grade 2 event at DRF; too keen then, and much the same story when third behind Switch From Diesel and Carrigmoornaspruce at Fairyhouse.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has prospered since beaten by Amen Kate at Listowel, closely matched with Future Prospect
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 7 1/2l by Amen Kate on debut at Listowel last September; made amends at Naas the following month and backed that up at Leopardstown in December; confirmed a high standard of form when third behind Bambino Fever and Switch From Diesel at the DRF; beaten 6l by Switch From Diesel at Fairyhouse, with Future Prospect third and Amen Kate fourth.
Horse quote: 2024-12-29 at Leopardstown (16f): "Carrigmoornaspruce was unreal. It was kind of the same as Naas. We just said to the boys that we would let her gallop around at the back and come home as well as we can. We're planning on coming here for the mares' bumper at the Dublin Racing Festival. It worked out and she's a very talented filly - Declan Queally, trainer."
