💬 Comment: Ex-Karl Burke; raced ten times last year, notably winning 5f maiden and runner-up over 6f
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Karl Burke; raced ten times last year, notably winning 5f maiden and runner-up in 6f nursery (both on soft ground); 18-1 for intended reappearance/stable debut over 7f earlier this month when withdrawn for being unruly; probably needs rain, but unappealing even if so.
