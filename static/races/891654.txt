🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice in the frame in Listed company last year; market useful back from six months off
🔦 Spotlight: Highly tried after winning a Newcastle maiden (1m2f, AW) early last year, but twice made the frame in Listed company on turf/AW including at Lingfield (1m5f) in November; may do even better this year and market support on this return from six months off would be significant.

🔦 Spotlight: Versatile as regards trip, winning at Ayr (1m2f, good) last August and the Mallard at Doncaster (14.5f, good to soft) the following month; should be all the better for last month's Musselburgh return and makes the shortlist; stable runs three.
Horse quote: 2024-09-13 at Doncaster (14.5f): "I just had to get Faylaq relaxed and it's worked out well. He was travelling so well and he picked up nicely - Amy Waugh, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Record here reads 5431231311 and is 2-4 over C&D; very much one to consider
🔦 Spotlight: Not hard to forgive last month's Musselburgh return as she lost all chance at the start (reared and blindfold removed late), while she has a modest record fresh in any case; however, her record here (5431231311 and 2-4 over C&D) makes her very much one to consider.
Horse quote: 2023-07-05 at Musselburgh (12.5f): "Tafsir is a well-bred filly so it's good to get a win, but Paul's given her an absolute peach of a ride. He's gone down the brave man's route down the inside rail and has won quite comfortably in the end. She'll win again, especially with the assistance of Paul. He's top-class - Jim Goldie, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Handy sort who has gained all five wins on the AW including when completing a hat-trick over 1m4f in February, but has suffered heavy defeats off this mark the last twice; stable (also responsible for Knockbrex) won this last year and a visor replaces blinkers, but he has something to prove back on turf (0-4).

💬 Comment: 3-7 over C&D, his latest win coming from 2lb higher; softer ground may suit ideally
🔦 Spotlight: 3-7 over C&D, his latest win coming from 2lb higher (soft) just under a year ago; patchy form since and although he has won on good to firm, softer ground may suit ideally.
