🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flat record suggests he's worth another crack at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Most of his hurdles form is at 2m; had a good spell when first joining current yard but inconsistent since and appeared to be outstayed by the comfortable winner over C&D in October; that said, Flat record suggests he's worth another crack at this trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Suited by good ground; returned from a break to complete a quickfire October double in her first two handicap attempts; took two steps backwards in November but a resumption of progress looks possible on return from four-month layoff.

🔦 Spotlight: Scored over fences here last term but suffered heavy defeats returned to chasing the last twice; has inconsistent hurdles form this season and isn't a solid option; however, has possibilities off current mark if helped by the belated reapplication of headgear.
