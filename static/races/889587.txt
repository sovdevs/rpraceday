üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Maiden who is well treated on peak efforts; second run for üÜï new yard
üî¶ Spotlight: Still a maiden but is favourably handicapped on peak efforts (6f/7f) and this drop back in distance is a plus on second start for new trainer, who also runs Mariner; could go well.
