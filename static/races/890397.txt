🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won first two outings last summer and fifth in 1m Group 1 final 2yo start; leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of novices at Newbury (6.5f, good to firm) and Sandown (7f, good) on first two starts; beaten 7l when stepped up to 1m for the Group 1 Futurity at Doncaster (soft) in the autumn but still posted an improved RPR and it's likely he can do better again in 2025; 🔥 big player back at 7f.
Horse quote: 2024-06-13 at Newbury (6.5f): "I wanted a lead, but then got sandwiched and Anno Domini was turned sideways. It was his first time out so I didn't want to make the experience any worse for him. But at the moment I asked him to put himself into the race, he did it very easily. He just pricked his ears when he got to the front, but he's a very nice horse and it was a very nice performance. I think he'll go on to much better things and a mile will definitely be within his compass further down the line - William Buick, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful 2yo but his limitations were seemingly exposed in 7f Group races on his final three outings; bang there on form but suspicion at least the odd one will improve past him.
Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at Ascot (7f): "Tiger Mask did well. We thought he'd run a good race as the form of his last run is working out very well. He wasn't doing a lot in front, he was looking at the stand and pricking his ears a bit so I do think he'll improve again - Pierre-Louis Jamin, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Impressive in newcomers' race on the July Course here (7f, good) last summer, making all by 5l; pulled too hard when last of five in the Group 2 Champagne at Doncaster (7f, good again) five weeks later but returns as a colt with potential; entered in the 2,000 Guineas.
Horse quote: 2024-08-09 at Newmarket (July) (7f): "Righthere Rightnow's homework has been good and we were wanting to get him out at a nice track. He's done it nicely and is going to be a lovely horse next year. He'll probably benefit from a little easier ground but his class has got him through today. He's in the Champagne [at Doncaster] and in a few sales races and we'll see how he comes out of it but he's a very nice horse to look forward to for next season - Richard Spencer, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."
