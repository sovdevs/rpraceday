üî¶ Spotlight: 10yo who proved too strong for Libberty Hunter in this race on soft last year and looks to have been campaigned with this contest in mind again, keeping on for best of the rest behind Matata in a 2m Windsor handicap (soft) in January; 6lb higher than 12 months ago but still much respected.

üî¶ Spotlight: Failed to win over hurdles but won his first two chases (yielding/good) in the autumn; good second at Punchestown (2m, yielding) in December; softer ground and a switch to hold-up tactics provide possible excuses for a below-par run back at Punchestown last month; handicap chase debut.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Won Down Royal novice chase latest but his jumping doesn't look sharp enough for this test
üî¶ Spotlight: Useful hurdler who translated all that ability to this sphere at the fourth time of asking when edging ahead late on in 2m Down Royal rated novice (good to yielding) seven weeks ago; his fencing was still novicey on occasions at Down Royal so whether his jumping stands up to this environment remains to be seen.

üí¨ Comment: Has progressed again this term, shaping well when second at Doncaster latest
üî¶ Spotlight: Good second on reappearance at Haydock (2m, soft) and easily went one better at Newbury (2m, good to soft) seven days later; below-par fourth of five back at Newbury next time but quickly back to form when second (Nells Son third) at Doncaster (2m, good) last time; the move he made from the back to the front before being worn down towards the finish at Doncaster suggests he's still going the right way; considered.

üî¶ Spotlight: Well handicapped on his best form for Dan Skelton, including fourth in this race two years ago, but has returned from a long absence for a üÜï new yard this season and finished well beaten on all three starts; this 10yo needs to stage a big revival.
