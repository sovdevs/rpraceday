🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive in Leopardstown Grade 1 event that regularly throws up winners at this meeting
🔦 Spotlight: Not without flaws, having shown signs of being an edgy/fizzy sort who could potentially boil over in this highly bustling arena, but he now wears a first-time hood which may prove beneficial; otherwise an exciting prospect who maintained his unbeaten record with an impressive display, despite taking a good hold, at Leopardstown (2m, soft) in a Grade 1 event that regularly throws up Cheltenham Festival winners; that latest performance, which also featured a better round of jumping than on hurdles debut, launched him into favouritism for this race; much respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Represents last year's winning yard and is a promising sort who comes here fresh
🔦 Spotlight: Represents last year's winning stable and is a promising sort who comes here fresh, having been absent since his Christmas performance at Leopardstown (2m, yielding; second rules attempt) where he made all to beat William Munny by 7l in a maiden hurdle and added to his point win; seems set for a tighter encounter with that opponent, who took a big step forward last month, but brings lots of potential and good credentials; one for the shortlist.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Registered an effortless Listed win at Punchestown last month; peaking at the right time
🔦 Spotlight: Respectable third in sole Grade 1 attempt (final start in bumpers); opened his hurdles account with an effortless Listed novice win at Punchestown (2m, soft; went clear on the bridle) last month when ridden by Sean Flanagan for the first time and settling better than previously in this sphere; now goes in first-time hood as an extra measure, which allies with the likely strong pace; peaking at the right time and looks set for an interesting rematch with Workahead, who beat him at Leopardstown in December; owner-trainer landed this prize two years ago with a horse ridden by Michael O'Sullivan, who very sadly lost his life recently and is honoured in the race title today; a fitting success is conceivable, with further improvement likely.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second to Sir Gino in sole French run; 2-2 this season and could well rate higher still
🔦 Spotlight: Highly notable form (clear second behind Sir Gino) in sole French outing; lack of experience counted against him in last year's Triumph Hurdle on debut for Willie Mullins; 2-2 this season, winning Tipperary maiden by 62l then overcoming a lack of fluency in Grade 2 at Punchestown (2m1f, soft) where he quickened best off the steady pace and scored by 3l; could well rate higher still, especially given the potential retained from his debut effort; 🔥 big player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked good last time; related to a dual Cheltenham Festival winner for his yard
🔦 Spotlight: Made all and easily drew well clear in the closing stages at Punchestown (2m, heavy; second run for Willie Mullins) six weeks ago, proving suited by the drop back in trip and adding to his French bumper win; suitably bred, being out of a half-sister to his yard's dual Cheltenham Festival scorer Sir Des Champs, and brings potential; interesting.

🔦 Spotlight: One of six runners for Willie Mullins; finished second in sole French start, then went one better at Clonmel (2m1f, soft) where the field lacked strength in depth but he justified short odds in comfortable fashion; now goes into much deeper waters but is highly 🔍 unexposed.
