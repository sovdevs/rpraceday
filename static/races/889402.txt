🔦 Spotlight: Disappointed when last of three at Wincanton (3m, good) on Monday but looked very well suited by the step up in trip when close/clear second to a next-time-out winner over that C&D (soft) in February and may yet build upon that performance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: May not be straightforward; switches to a handicap after going very close in a maiden
🔦 Spotlight: Looked promising in bumpers in the autumn (including on good ground) and has made the frame on both hurdling starts, more recently when very close second at Lingfield (2m3f, heavy) last month; may not be straightforward but she moves into handicaps with potential and her pedigree offers significant hope that this new trip will suit.
