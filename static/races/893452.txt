🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gowran winner was sent off only 12-1 for the Triumph Hurdle where jumping let him down
🔦 Spotlight: Useful 97-rated miler on Flat with Richard Hannon; won 16-runner maiden at Gowran Park (2m, soft) on hurdling debut in February, beating fair yardstick Kool One who is rated 120 now; was sent off only 12-1 for the Triumph Hurdle where jumping let him down and he was pulled up before the last; no surprise at all if he bounces back in this company.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Gowran Park (16f): "Blue Lemon did a lot right and there's plenty of improvement to come. He took his blow and ran on again. It's a different discipline to what he's used to but he took to it really well. I thought he could be very free coming from running over a mile but he did it very well. He saw out the trip well, which was an unknown. He will be a good dual purpose horse because with that attitude, you'll be able to mix it with him - Paul Townend, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrowly beaten by former French winner Kurasso Blue at Limerick and that is useful form
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth over hurdles in France last spring and off the mark on Irish debut at Punchestown in November; beaten 10l in Leopardstown Grade 2 at Christmas; narrowly beaten by former French winner Kurasso Blue at Limerick last month and that is probably useful form; now rated 129.
Horse quote: 2024-11-23 at Punchestown (16.5f): "Its Bilbo ran a nice race in France in the spring and he's a fine horse. He won't be in a mad rush with him. He was a bit green but he was able to get stuck in at the end - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all in fillies' maiden on hurdling debut at Limerick (good), beating 109-rated rival
🔦 Spotlight: 1m4f winner at modest level on final Flat start at three; back from six months off when making all in fillies' maiden on hurdling debut at Limerick (good), beating 109-rated rival by two lengths; likeable but good bit more needed to contend in this company.

💬 Comment: Third in Ballinrobe maiden last time; headgear back on but doesn't seem that 📈 progressive
🔦 Spotlight: Useful Flat winner in France; ran respectably in first three hurdle outings during the winter, was 2l behind Ephesus when sent off favourite at Naas in February; pulled up in the Fred Winter Hurdle at Cheltenham wearing cheekpieces; one-paced third in Ballinrobe maiden last time; headgear back on here but doesn't seem that 📈 progressive.
