🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful Flat handicapper; recent Wetherby third (2m, good) his best effort yet over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Proved himself a useful Flat handicapper, winning from a BHA mark of 93 at Haydock (2m) in May 2023; seems to be making progress over hurdles, his recent Wetherby third (2m maiden, good; post wind surgery) his best effort yet; merits respect upped-in-trip for the McCain/Hughes partnership.
Horse quote: 2023-05-27 at Haydock (16f): "I knew Solent Gateway quite well because I've ridden against him a few times and I just did what I was told by the boss. I got an easy lead. I cantered round in front, he was a relaxed horse and he was very push-button - Hollie Doyle, rider."
