🔦 Spotlight: Narrowly won a Kempton novice (1m; made all) in August and secured a 7f win there on his return last month, getting up late on in his third handicap (runner-up has won subsequently); pedigree suggests this trip will unlock more and he should make his presence felt up 3lb under Ryan Moore.

🔦 Spotlight: Steadily 📈 progressive in three qualifying runs last term, culminating in fifth of 11 at Sandown (1m, good) in September, around 3l behind one who now has a mark of 90 and Tuesday's Feilden winner Almeric; ✂️ gelded and tongue tied for this reappearance and AW/handicap debut; drawn wide but he's bred to get this trip and that last run makes him of firm interest.
