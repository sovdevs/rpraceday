🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Listed second at Taunton last time when the drop back to 2m appeared to be a negative
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 in bumpers and won her first two hurdle starts towards end of last year (2m5f/2m3f, good/soft); lost unbeaten record when second in Listed mares' novice at Taunton (2m, good to soft) but the drop back in trip appeared to be against her; stable has won two of the last four runnings and she could play a leading role now back up in trip.

💬 Comment: Made it 2-2 over hurdles with Listed win at Haydock; major player under 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Carries a 5lb penalty having won a Listed mares' novice at Haydock (2m3f, heavy) in December but she did that in good style to make it 2-2 over hurdles, and she could have plenty more to offer for her top yard.

💬 Comment: Soundly beaten in Listed bumper then won easily on hurdle debut; yard won this last year
🔦 Spotlight: Point and bumper winner who was soundly beaten in a Listed bumper at Cheltenham in November then won easily on last month's hurdle debut at Ayr (2m, soft); something to prove now back up in grade but it remains to be see where her limitations lie over hurdles and her yard won this last year.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten in Listed bumper then won easily on hurdle debut; yard won this last year
🔦 Spotlight: Point and bumper winner who was soundly beaten in a Listed bumper at Cheltenham in November then won easily on last month's hurdle debut at Ayr (2m, soft); something to prove now back up in grade but it remains to be see where her limitations lie over hurdles and her yard won this last year.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Listed bumper runner-up who could relish the step up in trip on hurdle debut
🔦 Spotlight: Thrown into a tough race for her hurdle debut but she's from a top Irish yard and showed lots of promise in bumpers, winning at Punchestown (2m, good) in October before a creditable Listed second at Navan (2m, yielding); this half-sister to 2m4f/3m1f Grade 1 chase winner Spillane's Tower could relish the step up in trip and she's firmly in calculations.

💬 Comment: Easily won at 2-9 at Ffos Las; not discounted but others have more substance to their form
🔦 Spotlight: Two-time bumper winner who kept on for a fair second on hurdle debut at Ffos Las (2m4f, soft) then easily justified odds of 2-9 there (2m, heavy); this likeable prospect isn't discounted but others have more substance to their form and she could do with hurdling with greater fluency.

💬 Comment: Listed second at Taunton last time when the drop back to 2m appeared to be a negative
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 in bumpers and won her first two hurdle starts towards end of last year (2m5f/2m3f, good/soft); lost unbeaten record when second in Listed mares' novice at Taunton (2m, good to soft) but the drop back in trip appeared to be against her; stable has won two of the last four runnings and she could play a leading role now back up in trip.

💬 Comment: Made it 2-2 over hurdles with Listed win at Haydock; major player under 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Carries a 5lb penalty having won a Listed mares' novice at Haydock (2m3f, heavy) in December but she did that in good style to make it 2-2 over hurdles, and she could have plenty more to offer for her top yard.
