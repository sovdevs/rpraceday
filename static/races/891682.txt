💬 Comment: 0-11 but he he has form figures of 3322 in handicaps; 🔥 big player eased in grade
🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 but he's finished runner-up eight times and has form figures of 3322 in handicaps; made some mistakes when beaten 15l at Haydock (2m3f, good) last time but that was behind an 🚀 improver and this looks a good opportunity on this drop back in grade.

💬 Comment: Triple hurdle winner who has claims on her best form last year; needs close look on return
🔦 Spotlight: Three hurdle wins in 2023, with latest off 2lb higher at Ludlow (2m5f, good); well held in final two runs during a light campaign last year but she was runner-up at Worcester last August and that was right up there with her best form; needs close look back from 199 days off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has struggled over fences this season and needs a major revival back over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point in 2022 and maiden hurdle in 2023, but he's struggled in chase handicaps at up to 2m5f this season; still 🔍 unexposed over hurdles but he needs a major revival back in this sphere; blinkers removed and cheekpieces return.
Horse quote: 2023-10-30 at Huntingdon (19.5f): "It's a shame Doc McCoy didn't win his bumper, but he has always been a proper jumper. He is an embryonic chaser as he won a point-to-point at Great Trethew. He bowled along in front when he won his point-to-point so we thought we would let him bowl along and make it a test. We could aim him at the EBF Final at Sandown in March. That  is probably his kind of race as it suits proper staying chasers. That will probably be his target - Jamie Snowden, trainer."
