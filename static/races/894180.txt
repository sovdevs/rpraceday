💬 Comment: 575,000euros yearling; bred to be useful and makes his debut at a modest level
🔦 Spotlight: 575,000euros yearling; seventh foal; closely related to 1m/9.5f 2yo winner Next Factor (including AW; RPR 90), half-brother to winners Lady Galore (5f Listed/5.5f 2yo; 96), Tikitiki (7f AW 2yo; 93) and Aiza (Moroccan 6.5f/9.5f); dam US 1m AW/dirt winner; makes his debut at a modest level and he's of obvious interest on paper.
