🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-3 over fences inc' Gr 2 novice and the pick of Walsh; interesting but needs improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Fell on chase debut but 2-3 since including a Grade 2 novice at Thurles in January; interesting that she's the pick of Walsh but doesn't look particularly well treated so will need to improve.
Horse quote: 2025-01-19 at Thurles (21f): "Nara is still forward-going and keen and jumped a bit better today although made a few novicey mistakes. Hopefully we can iron those out of her but she was good - Mark Walsh, rider"

💬 Comment: Improving over fences this season and only up 8lb for a facile Cheltenham success latest
🔦 Spotlight: Improving over fences this season and off the mark in a mares' novice handicap at Cheltenham 15 days ago; only 8lb higher for that facile 10l success and looks like a major player again.
Horse quote: 2024-02-24 at Fairyhouse (16f): "I'm delighted with that. Theatre Native ran very keen there all the way and when she learns to settle, obviously that will help her again. It was lovely to see her still finish out the race as well. She did a lovely piece of work about ten days ago, so that gave us some encouragement. I think the key is to try and get her to settle more. She's got an engine and I'm delighted she's done that - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

💬 Comment: In good form either side of the Festival and fascinating contender with Bowen booked
🔦 Spotlight: Won competitive handicap on Cheltenham trials day; pulled up at the Festival but bounced back with a respectable fourth in a Limited Grade 2 Handicap since; fascinating contender with Bowen booked.
Horse quote: 2025-01-25 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Moon D'Orange is a three-miler and couldn't go with them early on but it just shows what horses can do when you give them a chance early and don't hassle them. He'd have won well if it wasn't for the mistake at the last. Three or four strides before the fence he pricked his ears and I thought if I send him now he's going to do something stupid. He did something stupid anyway but I stayed on. I suppose it's instinct but he was tough - Sean Bowen, trainer."

💬 Comment: 0-6 over fences; not totally out of it on ability but others have stronger credentials
🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over fences; brought down at the Festival but has been running well in defeat in beginners' company this season; however, probably doesn't hold any secrets from the assessor.
Horse quote: 2023-11-18 at Navan (16f): "What's Up Darling is a speed horse but I thought Dee Capo was unlucky. Jack said he tried to run out down the far side. He gave away a lot of lengths, but we had first and second so we can't complain - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 1-15 over fences; chased home his stablemate The King Of Prs in Fairyhouse Grade 3 in January but hasn't kicked on twice since; this is tough.
Horse quote: 2024-10-25 at Cheltenham (16f): "I'm delighted, Path d'Oroux was banging on the door so many times last season and didn't win but got a lot of experience. It was a messy race, they went very slow and then turned into a sprint but he came out of it well. He's probably not good enough to mix it with the Grade 1 novices but at the same time he's experienced. In the early season in against some he may just have the upper hand. This was the plan for a while - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't build on mares' beginners' win last time and may want it softer
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark over fences in a mares' beginners' at Fairyhouse but didn't really build on that when a beaten favourite in Listed handicap company since; best form on softer ground than this.
Horse quote: 2023-04-13 at Aintree (17f): "Zenta was travelling great and winged the last and I landed in front, so I sent her on. I couldn't really peg her back, but I know in future to hold on to her. She's still very green and still learning in front of a big crowd today, so I know a bit more about her now - Mark Walsh, rider."

Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Leopardstown (16f): ""I chose No Flies On Him as a three-year-old at the Derby sales when JP very kindly let me pick one out and he sent him for his education with Derek O'Connor, who did a fantastic job with him. He has a wonderful pedigree and he looks like a very promising horse. I've had a lot of swans over the last few years who have turned out as geese but I think this fella might stay a swan! He will have to be entered in Grade 1s after this and hopefully he might get there - Edward O'Grady, trainer."

💬 Comment: 2nd in a novice here in February but disappointing fav' at Ayr last month
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a novice here in February but was a disappointing favourite at Ayr last month; mark may be stiff enough for now.
Horse quote: 2024-01-27 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Western Diego was good and did it well. He's a keen-going sort and he would have improved plenty for his first run. Brian said he was still gnawing at him there, but he did it well. He won a 2m3f bumper so he was always going to stay but, if he just helps himself, he'll stay better. He did settle better today with the run under his belt. He's going the right direction anyway - David Casey, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Off the mark at Navan in March; another solid effort since and return to shorter may help
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at Navan in March and posted another creditable effort over extended 2m7f since; return to 2m4f no problem and one to consider.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Navan (20.5f): "Prince Palace had never won anything until now but he had been coming along nicely. He had a few lovely runs and it worked out today. We only get the odd big one these days. I didn't even look at this race when it was on in Naas because it was coming too soon, but we said we'd take our chance when it was moved, given he seemed to be going very well two and a half furlongs out here the last day over three miles - Pat Fahey, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-03-10 at Thurles (16.5f): "Sir Argus is still very green and changed his legs and was leaning left and right and I think there is more improvement in him. He has a fantastic staying pedigree and will be better when he gets a trip - Patrick Mullins, rider."
