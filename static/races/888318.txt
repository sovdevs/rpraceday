🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairly useful juvenile hurdler; Grade 2 runner-up; respected back down in class
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful juvenile hurdler who scored easily at Wetherby then ran well in Grade 2 contest at Chepstow; underperformed in the Victor Ludorum at Haydock since but this is a drop back in class and also markedly easier than the Triumph Hurdle he was withdrawn from (due to the ground) last week; respected, assuming conditions are okay.

🔦 Spotlight: Three Flat wins in France; both hurdles starts for Keiran Burke, finishing second over C&D (behind useful sort who has progressed since) then beaten when falling at Kempton where he wore a hood (now removed); interesting, given that he has a strong piece of Ludlow form.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in 2m maiden hurdles at Market Rasen and Southwell but didn't live up to market expectations in Huntingdon handicap; chance of opening his account partly depends on how well he responds to tongue-tie (replaces the hood worn in all starts).
