💬 Comment: Lightly raced and fast-improving 5yo who comes here after two emphatic wins at Fakenham
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced and fast-improving 5yo who comes here after two emphatic wins at Fakenham (both 2m4f, good to soft); contests a deeper race today but latest 4lb rise does not look excessive; must be considered.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Fakenham (20f): "Busy Being Busy has been very tricky at home as he's very keen, but it worked out well today. I think the fierce pace around this track helped him - Stuart Edmunds, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful Flat stayer; ready 2m1f novice hurdle winner; up in trip for handcap hurdle debut
🔦 Spotlight: Useful Flat stayer who did not need to improve to justify skinny odds in Sedgefield novice (2m1f, good) on latest hurdling start in November; ran as though something was amiss on AW in February but remains 🔍 unexposed over hurdles and ought to be suited by the step up in trip on this handicap debut.
Horse quote: 2024-11-26 at Sedgefield (17f): "Mr Escobar wouldn't have been good enough to win a maiden hurdle in Ireland, so Patrick and Willie thought they might as well come here and try to win a maiden. He's a bit quirky. He didn't jump round one day at Killarney, he ran out before the [first] hurdle, so that's in the back of your mind going down to the first. I just thought the best of the ground was out wide, but it didn't matter and he would have still won anyway. It was nice to get it done. The track suited him, it kept him interested, and I was delighted with the way he jumped - Brian Hayes, rider, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runs this track very well and has slipped to a workable mark; can make presence felt
🔦 Spotlight: Gained two of his five hurdle wins at this track and was second in Sussex Champion Hurdle here (2m, good) just over a year ago; returned from seven-month break with encouraging third at Bangor (2m3f, good; form working out well) in March and has slipped to a workable mark; can make presence felt.
Horse quote: 2024-03-04 at Plumpton (16f): "Mr Freedom is a pleasure to have. People ask me what trip he wants and I don't know. What ground does he want? I don't know either. Cheekpieces on or off? It could be either. It doesn't matter what you do, he always gives his best. It makes him really hard to place, because we don't have parameters to stick to. You're just spoiled for choice, so we try and pick winnable races. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we don't, but he hasn't done anything wrong this season - Sheena West, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back from break with some below-par runs but now well handicapped on early-season form
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in early part of season and was subsequently placed off mark 8lb higher than today's in Summer Hurdle at Market Rasen (2m, good); well below that form since returning from break in February (four runs) but sports refitted cheekpieces today and a sudden revival would not surprise.
