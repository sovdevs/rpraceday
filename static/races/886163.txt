🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Multiple winner on slow ground; lost a shoe when favourite latest; not ruled out.
🔦 Spotlight: Was in super form last winter, winning four from five starts at one stage, from 2m4f-3m1f on slow ground; handicapper appears to have taken his measure, though he did start favourite at Bangor latest, when losing a shoe; drops 2lb and not ruled out.

💬 Comment: Below par in two chase starts; has dropped 8lb and no surprise if he is able to show more.
🔦 Spotlight: 2m4f hurdle winner (heavy); well treated on his best hurdles form; was perhaps too free on his chase debut at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy) last December, before being pulled up at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) latest; has dropped 8lb over those two starts and no surprise if he is able to show more.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Creditable third here (2m4f) last December on his only recent outing and is not ruled out.
🔦 Spotlight: 2m6f hurdle winner (good) but has only made it to the track once since that success in May 2022; creditable third here (2m4f, soft) last December, on that only recent outing and not ruled out if backing that up.

💬 Comment: Below par in two chase starts; has dropped 8lb and no surprise if he is able to show more.
🔦 Spotlight: 2m4f hurdle winner (heavy); well treated on his best hurdles form; was perhaps too free on his chase debut at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy) last December, before being pulled up at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) latest; has dropped 8lb over those two starts and no surprise if he is able to show more.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Creditable third here (2m4f) last December on his only recent outing and is not ruled out.
🔦 Spotlight: 2m6f hurdle winner (good) but has only made it to the track once since that success in May 2022; creditable third here (2m4f, soft) last December, on that only recent outing and not ruled out if backing that up.

💬 Comment: C&D winner; handy mark but has a bit to prove now; visored for first time.
🔦 Spotlight: Sole chase win came over C&D (soft) last winter, when 2lb higher; inconsistent since; handy mark going back up in trip from two recent 2m4f starts but has something to prove; visored for first time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below par in two chase starts; has dropped 8lb and no surprise if he is able to show more.
🔦 Spotlight: 2m4f hurdle winner (heavy); well treated on his best hurdles form; was perhaps too free on his chase debut at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy) last December, before being pulled up at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) latest; has dropped 8lb over those two starts and no surprise if he is able to show more.
