💬 Comment: Flat winner but 0-8 hurdling; still commands a second look for ultra-shrewd Irish yard
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time Flat winner; 0-8 over hurdles but having only his third race for Charles Byrnes and better was expected of him when last seen in October (2m2f, good) as he went off favourite; would be of strong interest should his backers return.
