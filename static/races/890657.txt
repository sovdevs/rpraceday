🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some good 5f form here & she's been shaping as though this step back up in trip will suit
🔦 Spotlight: Won 5f nursery here in December and kept on for third over 5f here four weeks ago; below par over C&D in December on sole previous attempt at 6f but she's been shaping as though today's trip will suit; respected.
