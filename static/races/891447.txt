🔦 Spotlight: Placed twice as a 2yo, notably when third in a 0-65 at Thirsk last September (6f, good to soft; cheekpieces first time); improved effort when finishing off well for second at Pontefract last week (6f, good; Sanbona back in fourth); solid contender.

💬 Comment: Best effort so far when 4th dropped to 6f last week; races off 5lb lower today; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't progress as a 2yo and he was well beaten on his reappearance here two weeks ago (1m, good); dropped back to 6f and tried in a visor at Pontefract last week and he showed good speed, having most of the field off the bridle over 2f out; tired in the closing stages, eventually finishing fourth, but it suggested sprinting was his forte and he is able to race off 5lb lower today; solid claims.

🔦 Spotlight: Didn't live up to market expectation in three AW novice/maiden runs in February and March but did show some ability; makes her handicap debut at a low level and with a visor added; one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Showed little on her first four starts but much more to take from last week's Pontefract fifth (6f, good; fillies' novice), racing wide but only losing third late on; likely she'll be getting a hike up the weights for that and she's open to further progress; not ruled out.
