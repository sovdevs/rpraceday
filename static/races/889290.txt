💬 Comment: Evens favourite when narrowly denied by a Ralph Beckett newcomer at Kempton
🔦 Spotlight: Evens favourite when narrowly denied by a Ralph Beckett newcomer at Kempton last November (1m) and the third has won since; half-brother to a 1m4f winner in France so going further this afternoon should help, as might the application of a hood; stable runs two.
