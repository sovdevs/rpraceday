💬 Comment: Disappointing when favourite at Warwick but she could bounce back after wind surgery
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £130,000 after finishing second in Irish point last February; eyecatching third on bumper/stable debut at Aintree (good) in the autumn but was a well-held third when favourite at Warwick (soft) in February; bit to prove after another break but she's had wind surgery and could bounce back with a big run back on quicker ground; tongue-tie added.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner who was runner-up on comeback at Plumpton and sets standard on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Won her sole Irish point (3m, good) in March 2023; back from long absence at Plumpton (2m1f, good) 15 days ago but she was well backed and gave it a good shot from the front before finishing second of nine; sets the standard on that form and she's strongly respected.

🔦 Spotlight: Slipped up in her first Irish point but she won the second one last April and was bought for £70,000 the following month; out of a half-sister to bumper/smart hurdle winner Alpha Ridge and she needs a close look now switched to rules on her comeback; tongue-tie on.
