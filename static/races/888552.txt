🔦 Spotlight: Seven-race maiden; tends to be sluggish in early stages of his races but finished well for fourth over 6f two starts ago and didn't get the best of runs when keeping-on third over 7f last time; well worth another crack at 1m and could be dangerous if all goes to plan.

🔦 Spotlight: Yet to be placed after six starts but caught the eye when running on well from the rear for fifth at Wolverhampton (8.6f) a fortnight ago and remains 🔍 unexposed over this sort of trip; worth a 📊 market check.
