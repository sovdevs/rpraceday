🔦 Spotlight: Has four wins (1m2f/2m) on his CV but last two were on AW in January 2023; has tumbled down the weights but he's been beaten 6l or more in last seven runs and is untried at this trip; down the list.
Horse quote: 2023-01-22 at Newcastle (AW) (16.5f): "We didn't go that quick and it can't turn into a sprint with Quercus Robur, he needs everything to go smooth. The drop back in trip didn't suit him last time. Back up to two miles today was ideal. He's a bit quirky, going down to the start he was a bit reluctant but you just have to kid him into races a little bit - Kevin Stott, jockey."
