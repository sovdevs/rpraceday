🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced with absences but Chepstow 3rd (2m4f, soft) in October gives him good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Bred to stay at least this far, brother to smart Springwell Bay; third in a bumper here (heavy) on debut in January 2023; has had two long breaks since and only two more races but his third of 14 to subsequently high-class The New Lion (on his hurdle debut) in maiden at Chepstow (2m4f, soft) in October gives him a good chance today and he should have potential.

🔦 Spotlight: Useful pedigree; won Bangor bumper last April; something amiss on hurdles debut but, after wind surgery, he's improving now and took second of 12 to an impressive odds-on shot in a maiden at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) three weeks ago; one of the top two on form and shapes as if he'll stay.
