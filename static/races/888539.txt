🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returns from break having had wind surgery and he's respected for his top yard
🔦 Spotlight: Last spring's wins came over 2m4f/2m3f on good ground and he needs to prove he's fully effective on good to soft going; however, he wasn't running badly in the autumn when last seen and the subsequent wind operation may have been a help to him; respected for top yard.

💬 Comment: Shaped pretty well on comeback from long absence, even though he was pulled up; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up just over two months ago when back from a long absence and needs to prove how much ability he retains; however, he shaped pretty well for a fair way on that latest start and he was a highly 📈 progressive novice chaser in the 2022-23 campaign; no surprise if he has a big say today.
