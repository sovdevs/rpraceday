🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise in a good race on debut; tough task at Goodwood when last seen; sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Showed some promise when fifth of eight in a 6f novice at Salisbury on his debut last June (useful form); slowly away on that occasion and again when never in the hunt in a 6f maiden at Glorious Goodwood the following month; has an eight-month absence to overcome but he's bred to stay and that debut effort is the best form on offer.
