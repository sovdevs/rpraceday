💬 Comment: Won at Fontwell last month and the form has been boosted; up 7lb but still a major player
🔦 Spotlight: 1m6f soft-ground Flat winner on his final start for Hugo Palmer and justifed market support when making it tenth-time lucky for this yard over hurdles at Fontwell (2m6f, good) last month (second and sixth won next time); up 7lb but still a major player.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-13 under rules but ran with credit when in the frame off this mark on good ground at Taunton (2m3f) and Wincanton (2m4f; first-time visor) last month; wouldn't need to find much more in order to figure with a tongue-tie added.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in a bumper and in three of his six starts over hurdles; should be all the better for his return from a year off when a remote fourth of seven finishers at Taunton (2m3f, heavy) in February and this trip may prove ideal; respected in first-time cheekpieces.
