💬 Comment: Lightly raced 4yo who is 📈 progressive and has won twice over C&D; firmly in calculations
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who won four times last August-October, including twice over C&D (good to firm/heavy); reappeared with close third in the Spring Mile at Doncaster (1m, good to soft) four weeks ago and this drop back to 7f may well be the right move for the time being; firmly in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive at Royal Ascot last year; inconsistent since; could go well having been ✂️ gelded
🔦 Spotlight: Bolted up over over C&D (soft) last May and did likewise in the Buckingham Palace Handicap at Royal Ascot (7f, good to firm) next time; inconsistent in Group and Listed races subsequently but makes his reappearance having been ✂️ gelded and he's a major player if at the top of his game.
Horse quote: 2024-06-20 at Ascot (7f): "English Oak is clearly a classy sort, he travelled superbly through the race. We had a massive advantage on the stands' side, even after going a furlong or so we were a long way ahead of the others. He's very speedy. He's got a high cruising speed, he does feel pretty fast. When I let him go there he quickened up pretty smartly. It will be interesting to see what the guys want to do - James Doyle, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: All six races on good/good to firm; off the mark at Newmarket (1m) last May on second handicap start before fine second in the Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot (1m); absent since but this 🔍 unexposed 4yo retains potential and could prove to be better than his current mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Thirsk (7f, good to firm) last May and close second over this C&D (good to soft) in September on last turf start; three 7f wins from his four AW starts since; needs to transfer that improvement back to grass but this thriving 5yo is entitled to respect.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 last year and it was an in-and-out campaign; soundly beaten on reappearance at Musselburgh two weeks ago but he may have needed the run; on a dangerous mark on last season's best efforts and is 2-3 here; not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2024-08-17 at Ripon (6f): "I was cheering for them both because they both deserved it. Ramazan really deserves one as he just got beat at Ascot earlier in the season. Ramazan must be a tough horse, over six or seven furlongs he always runs his heart out and he's probably Listed class - Robin O'Ryan, trainer's assistant."

🔦 Spotlight: Last July's C&D win (soft) was the first leg of a hat-trick (the other wins came on good ground); fair performance in big-field handicap at Leopardstown last September when last seen (found to be lame) and this 4yo could have more to offer this term; possible contender.
Horse quote: 2024-08-30 at Thirsk (7f): "All credit to Cerulean Bay, he had it all to do from that draw,. We were drawn the widest and he's off 96 now, he's high enough but he's got the right attitude. If something comes to him, he keeps going and he likes it here. There's no stopping him at the minute, he's having a great season - Danny Tudhope, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All races on slow ground and inconsistent last year, but still managed two wins
🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent last year (tailed off when last seen) and he's done all his racing on slow ground; however, he's very talented on his day, as when winning at Thirsk last June and at Doncaster last September; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2024-09-15 at Doncaster (7f): "I wasn't expecting ground like that and Telemark likes it. He's always been a horse with some talent but things haven't always dropped right for him and that ground enabled him to be seen at his best. He's done it well. The key to him is to get a little bit of cover, try to get him to switch off and then he can finish his race nicely. If you watch his last run at Goodwood he put up a pretty solid effort and this hasn't come as a big surprise - but a nice one - Simon Crisford, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His last three wins have come at York and he reappears minus the usual visor
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well at York on last season's return and won there in July; however, good runs were in the minority last term and his last three wins have come at York; makes reappearance minus usual visor; others preferred.
Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at York (8f): "Blue For You seems to like this track. We've tried him at Ascot a few times and it's never worked, but he's bounced back from a terrible run down there. It's horses for courses. He normally shows his best here. We'll do the same thing and go to Goodwood and then come back for the mile race here at the Ebor meeting - David O'Meara, trainer."

💬 Comment: On a competitive mark but last seven wins have come on slow ground at Goodwood or Epsom
🔦 Spotlight: 2yo C&D winner in 2020 and he's on a competitive mark on last year's best form; likely to improve for recent reappearance run (did so last year to finish close fourth in this race on soft going) but his last seven wins have come on slow ground at Goodwood or Epsom and he may be one for another day.
Horse quote: 2023-08-26 at Goodwood (7f): "Rhoscolyn lost his mojo a bit, but he likes Goodwood and likes that ground - Dominic McFadden, part-owner."
