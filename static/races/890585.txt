🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improving 7yo who's had three wins and three seconds from his six starts this season
🔦 Spotlight: Improving 7yo who's had three wins and three seconds from his six starts this season; last four outings were under 7lb-claiming amateur Toby McCain-Mitchell; put in his place last time but the winner scored almost as comfortably in a much better race at Cheltenham this week and the third has been runner-up; trip and ground fine; plenty to like.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won smoothly on soft in this race last year; 2nd on good over 3m5f/3m4f on last two starts
🔦 Spotlight: Won smoothly on soft ground in this race last year (7lb higher today); handicapper has had the call since but seconds at Warwick (3m5f, good) and Haydock (3m4f, good) on last two outings showed that he should have a big say in this very small field.
Horse quote: 2024-03-30 at Haydock (25.5f): "Duke Of Deception has been a different horse this year. He was really inconsistent last season for whatever reason but he seems to travel and jump a lot better. He handles the soft ground and he's going the right way - Oliver Greenall, joint trainer."

💬 Comment: Won at Ffos Las (3m, soft) in November; rallying to challenge when he fell at Southwell
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 7yo, seen in clearly his most favourable light when off the mark in handicap chase at Ffos Las (3m, soft; 40-1) in November; well below form eight days later (good to firm) but he was rallying to challenge when falling two out at Southwell (3m2f, good to soft) last month; possibilities.

💬 Comment: Finally off the mark in January; first time since 2021 that's he's not had his tongue tied
🔦 Spotlight: 13 seconds tell a story but he did get off the mark at the 27th attempt, at Uttoxeter (3m2f, good to soft) in January; pulled up next time (3m6f, heavy) and well beaten latest (3m, good) but he's well capable of being bang there on a good day; first time since 2021 that's he's not had his tongue tied.
