🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reacted well to blinkers when off mark over C&D last week; should go well under a penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Reacted well to a change of headgear (first-time blinkers for cheekpieces) when off the mark in a C&D handicap last Friday, drawing away late on; a 5lb penalty won't prevent him making a bold bid if the blinkers work as well a second time.

🔦 Spotlight: Bounced back from a couple of lesser efforts to land a first success in Britain in 9.4f Wolverhampton handicap 12 days ago; nicely on top by the finish there, suggesting this slightly longer trip may suit him even better; raised 4lb but Ryan Kavanagh takes off 5lb this time; leading claims.
