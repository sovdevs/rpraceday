💬 Comment: Weak handicap form lately and not suited by the race conditions against the Mullins pair
🔦 Spotlight: 2-18 over fences; over two years since her chase wins were achieved back-to-back at Punchestown (2m7f) and Fairyhouse (2m5f); best 2024 performances were also over further, second in a valuable Punchestown handicap, same placing in a Listed mares' race at Clonmel; weak handicap form lately and not suited by the race conditions here.

💬 Comment: Weak handicap form lately and not suited by the race conditions against the Mullins pair
🔦 Spotlight: 2-18 over fences; over two years since her chase wins were achieved back-to-back at Punchestown (2m7f) and Fairyhouse (2m5f); best 2024 performances were also over further, second in a valuable Punchestown handicap, same placing in a Listed mares' race at Clonmel; weak handicap form lately and not suited by the race conditions here.

💬 Comment: Inconsistent and more effective over further but won this last year, good chance of repeat
🔦 Spotlight: 5-12 over fences; inconsistent but in top form when making all to trounce Limerick Lace in a Grade 3 contest over 2m5f at Fairyhouse on New Year's Day, making amends for an odds-on failure at Clonmel; finished around 6l behind Dinoblue (gave 2lb) in last season's Grade 2 mares' event at Cheltenham; has done most of her racing over further but won this last year.
