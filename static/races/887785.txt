💬 Comment: Inconsistent and more effective over further but won this last year, good chance of repeat
🔦 Spotlight: 5-12 over fences; inconsistent but in top form when making all to trounce Limerick Lace in a Grade 3 contest over 2m5f at Fairyhouse on New Year's Day, making amends for an odds-on failure at Clonmel; finished around 6l behind Dinoblue (gave 2lb) in last season's Grade 2 mares' event at Cheltenham; has done most of her racing over further but won this last year.
