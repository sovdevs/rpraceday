🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hold-up horse; Jamie Spencer a notable booking and could threaten if getting the breaks
🔦 Spotlight: Drawn wide but he's a hold-up performer who won over C&D last month and might have followed up with a clearer run at Wolverhampton; Jamie Spencer a notable booking and could threaten if getting the breaks.
Horse quote: 2020-10-06 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "Sir Maxi has been doing everything lovely at home, he does tend to be a small bit keen and he was kind of hanging out around the bends because he's trying to pull too hard and go too quick for himself. As soon as they turned in I just needed him to switch onto that right lead and as soon as he did he quickened away nicely. All he's done this year is only a bonus for what he could be next year, we've always looked at him as being a three-year-old - Rossa Ryan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing favourite in a seller last time but that was only four days after finishing close up in an 8.6f handicap at Wolverhampton; defied a 1lb higher mark over this trip at Kempton in January; new headgear today.
Horse quote: 2025-01-22 at Kempton (AW) (7f): "Forever Proud doesn't do an awful lot when she hits the front but if something rallied I always thought she'd go again. It was a very different scenario tonight, she's been running over an extended mile at Wolverhampton - that suits her very well - and I had slight reservations about 7f round here, but she's in such a good vein of form at the moment and all credit to James [Owen, trainer] and the team, they'e got her spot on - Hector Crouch, jockey, talking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Won his novice over C&D and added a 7f handicap at Wolverhampton in October; his last couple of runs have been underwhelming but he's on a perfectly good mark if bouncing back.
Horse quote: 2022-08-16 at Chelmsford (AW) (7f): "It all happened a bit too quickly for Zu Run on his debut at Salisbury over the six furlongs. He missed the break and got unbalanced at times but I felt that he hit the line well enough for an extra furlong to help him and that's exactly what happened here. He showed a good attitude to the line and it's nice that he's taken a good step forward from that first experience - David Probert, jockey."

💬 Comment: Dual winner for Charles Hills who has hurtled down the weights for good reason
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner for Charles Hills who has hurtled down the weights for good reason; returns from his third wind operation inside 12 momths.
Horse quote: 2023-04-20 at Newmarket (7f): "I think that was the ride of the meeting. Harry Magnus was drawn one at Goodwood first time out and he jumped right away from the field and he was then in no man's land. Seven furlongs suits him well but he has got a bit of speed. We could drop him back in trip as he might get quicker. He has been a bit green learning his job and he is not fully there yet - Charles Hills, trainer."
