🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart 2yo; ready win over C&D this month (after a break); not sure to back it up
🔦 Spotlight: Smart 2yo; hasn't had a clear run at things since but he returned from 292 days off to win a C&D handicap in good style early this month (hooded for the first time); while he was strong at the finish there, the race did look to fall apart a bit and it remains to be seen if he can back it up; a 6lb rise won't be beyond him if he does.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Effective over C&D but he's been struggling in Dubai this year; dangerous mark though
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 here but he has finished second on three occasions; less consistent than normal in 2024 but form such as his Ayr Gold Cup second (off 9lb higher) confirmed a chunk of ability remained; three heavy defeats in Dubai this year leave him with plenty to prove but he's dropped 7lb on his travels and he's likely to bounce back at some point; widest stall not ideal for a prominent racer in a race with other pace on.
