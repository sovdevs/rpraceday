💬 Comment: Ran well in defeat in both chases; 🔥 big player if today's faster ground suits
🔦 Spotlight: Placed on handicap hurdle debut at Uttoxeter (2m7f, good to soft) last May and returned from break with two clear seconds in slow-ground Leicester chases (2m6f/2m4f) this winter; 🔥 big player if coping with the quicker conditions.

🔦 Spotlight: 🔍 unexposed 7yo who showed promise in Irish points last year and was placed in a 2m novice hurdle last month (good ground); ran very poorly when returned to 2m4f for next outing, though, and it's hard to know what to expect from her on this chase/handicap debut.
