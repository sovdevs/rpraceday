🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over C&D last month and he went close over 1m here last time; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Four good runs from five starts (all here) since he returned to action in December, including a C&D win last month and a close call over 1m last time; up another 2lb but he still looks feasibly treated and is open to more progress; key player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four AW wins over 7f and he could be dangerous dropped back in trip and grade
🔦 Spotlight: All four wins over 7f on AW and latest was at Kempton last August; been a bit up and down since then but he went close at Kempton on his penultimate run and ran respectably when returned to 1m there last time; now only 2lb higher than for last win and has possibilities back in trip.
