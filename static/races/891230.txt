🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shaped like 2m may suit when beaten a neck over 1m4f here; good run over timber latest
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped like further may suit when beaten a neck over 1m4f here in December; beaten favourite in her subsequent outing but ran with credit over timber last week and has untapped potential at this sort of trip in this sphere; respected with Keane on.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 on the Flat but has shown ability and would have been unsuited by the drop in trip here two weeks ago; workable mark if he can build on that and probably has more to offer at this sort of distance.
