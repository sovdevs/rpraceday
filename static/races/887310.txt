🔦 Spotlight: Fair third on debut in Irish mares' maiden point (3m, good) last May and changed hands for £78,000 later that month; her dam was a useful 2m4f/3m1f hurdle/chase winner for the yard and she could have a bright future under rules; no surprise if she's in the mix on bumper debut.

🔦 Spotlight: It's very early days for this £50,000 gelding who is in good hands and from the family of Azertyuiop, and he returns from wind surgery wearing a first-time tongue-tie; however, he was tailed off on his debut at Hexham (2m, soft; 10-1) in October and a transformation is needed.
