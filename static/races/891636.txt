🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third over C&D on debut when her inexperience was evident off the bridle; can do better
🔦 Spotlight: Ran a strange race over C&D on her debut 19 days ago (good to soft), showing bright speed early but losing her position 2f out and then running very green; kept on again late and she could prove a different proposition with the run behind her.
