🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11-time winner and last success was at Hamilton 15 days ago; respected up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: 11-time winner and her last success was from the front at Hamilton (5f, good to firm) 15 days ago; that was at odds-on in a small field but she still looks feasibly treated off 5lb higher and could make another bold bid back up in grade.
Horse quote: 2024-01-27 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "She's a really game mare. I thought Hurt You Never might need the run but she showed she's in great form. Early on I thought I'd gone a bit quick but she just kept powering through - Mia Nicholls, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Generally reliable mare and she didn't get much luck at Beverley last time; dangerous
🔦 Spotlight: Generally reliable mare who was a close second at Doncaster (5f, good to firm) last month and she didn't get much luck in similar conditions at Beverley last Tuesday; was beaten less than 2l in that race and she's an interesting contender.
Horse quote: 2024-08-15 at Beverley (5f): "Opal Storm likes the place but she just needs a bit of luck in running - Brian Rothwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two wins last season but he doesn't have a great record when fresh and this is competitive
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile ground-wise and he won twice over 5f at Pontefract last year, including in his final run last season; probably still has some room to manoeuvre off this 5lb higher mark but he doesn't have a great record when fresh and this is competitive on his return.
Horse quote: 2020-10-16 at Haydock (5f): "I bagged the rail and Holbache was pretty tough as that ground is hard work. The gelding operation will be the making of him. He's challenging his toughness in the right direction and is on the right track now - Tom Marquand, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled in both runs for 🆕 new yard this spring and needs a major revival back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Ended last season with a comfortable win at Sandown (5f, good) but he's struggled in two runs for 🆕 new yard this spring; now only 2lb higher than for his last success but he needs a major revival on this drop back in trip.
Horse quote: 2023-07-29 at York (5f): "It's very different. By the time you get to the winning line here, in a chase you'd just be getting your position, but that was fantastic. I thought Soul Seeker had a good each-way chance because he'd won it before, he looked well handicapped on his old form and David had him spot on. I was on a very experienced, streetwise horse. He's a lovely ride and he did everything for me. The other horse put it up to him and he had to put his head down and battle and he did that. He's very genuine - Micheal Nolan, jockey."
