üí¨ Comment: Easily best turf form was C&D; career best on AW 17 days ago; cheekpieces are enlisted
üî¶ Spotlight: Close third over C&D (good to soft) last September was easily his best form on turf; 3lb higher today, so he needs to improve on that performance but he's never been better than when beaten a neck on AW 17 days ago (having been ‚úÇÔ∏è gelded); always tongue tied and now has cheekpieces as well; considered.

üî¶ Spotlight: Won last summer on all of his first four starts once stepped up to 1m2f, on a range of ground; off two months before losing that proud record in October over C&D but he ran creditably to go down by just 3l; it's possible he can resume his progress this term and the market can give clues.
