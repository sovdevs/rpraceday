🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ungenerous mark judged on 7f-1m efforts to date, but should fare better upped in trip.
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent form level across this winter's keeping-on efforts (7f-1m), and may yet prove capable of transcending an ungenerous-looking mark, considering the Group 1/Grade 3-winning prowess at 1m4f in the family.

🔦 Spotlight: Expected improvement for 1m4f duly came on this month's Wolverhampton handicap debut second of four; mark unchanged and a stronger gallop may help, should one materialise (first off the bridle last time).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D 0-60 winner latest; more needed, but escaped with just a 1lb rise; cheekpieces added.
🔦 Spotlight: Step up from 7f and sufficient cover inspired a personal best when taking a C&D 0-60 latest; has left Gary Brown since, and another set of likely improvers for 1m4f awaits in a higher banded race, but chance nonetheless off only 1lb higher; cheekpieces added.

💬 Comment: Mark looks about right on peak form to date; out of a 1m4f-plus winner; appealing.
🔦 Spotlight: Mark looks right next to the RPR for October's Bath 1m2f third (heavy); less effective over the same trip on Polytrack subsequently, but he may well come into his own over 1m4f, the shortest his dam won over.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returning tongue-tie and gelding operation may inspire better; 1m4f asks a new question.
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to build on December's Wolverhampton debut fifth (8.6f), though the return of that day's tongue-tie and a gelding operation may inspire better; 1m4f asks a new question, but initial mark doesn't look unrealistic.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In rear on every start last term (7f-1m); may improve for longer trip; mark is no gift.
🔦 Spotlight: Hard to assess solely on basis of three turf/Polytrack efforts last summer and autumn (7f-1m), when never out of rear; winning mainland European 1m4f form in pedigree offers hope, but no chance taken with mark.
