🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Comes here in good form but not sure to reverse latest placings with Combustion
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark when making all at Southwell (5f) last month; similar form when chasing home Combustion at Chelmsford (6f) ten days later; 5lb better off today but it might not be enough.
