💬 Comment: Won well over C&D in December but blew out back here last month; has something to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Looked a nice prospect when winning a novice on his return from six months off over C&D in December, but blew out completely under a penalty back here last month (no explanation offered); a player if returning to the form of his win, but he does have something to prove on handicap debut.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 last year after winning his sole start here (7f) as a 2yo, but having dropped in the weights he ran well when third of ten at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) in December; down another 1lb and could play a part if taking another step forward.
