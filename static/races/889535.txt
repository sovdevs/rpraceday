🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked to show ability on soft turf last year but form isn't robust; off since September
🔦 Spotlight: Looked to show fair ability when sixth in 6f soft-ground Newbury maiden in September on second start, but there was a bunched finish so it may be unreliable form and he has been off since; dam won on the AW.

🔦 Spotlight: By a good sire but there's less appeal on the dam's side of her pedigree; hard to know what to expect on debut, but she's the sole ride on the card for a jockey who has been firing in the winners in the UAE (26 and counting this term) and who'll be having his first mount in Britain this year.
