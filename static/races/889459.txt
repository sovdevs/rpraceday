🔦 Spotlight: Won this from the front (soft; acts well on good) 12 months ago but, although he started the winter with two respectable efforts, his form since Christmas leaves much to be desired; back on that last winning mark and market support would suggest there have been green shoots evident at home since last seen in February.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good 2m win in October; drying ground will suit; highish mark for this competitive a race
🔦 Spotlight: Can lead; his one run here was a very respectable show until falling at the last in Grade 1 novice chase at the 2023 meeting; gained a useful win at Cheltenham (2m, good) in October and drying ground will suit but he needs to show he's well enough treated for this competitive a race.
