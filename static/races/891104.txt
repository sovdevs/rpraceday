🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shock 2m winner here latest, up 7lb and up in trip, chance if repeats that last run
🔦 Spotlight: Shock 66-1 winner on heavy ground off 72 here last month over 2m; up 7lb and steps up in trip; trainer said a more positive ride brought about the improvement; a repeat of that would likely be enough to take this, though the ground will be a bit livelier here; chance.
