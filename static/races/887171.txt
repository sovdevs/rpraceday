🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stayed on well over 2m3f to make winning handicap debut two weeks ago; up 4lb; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in bumpers; slow start over hurdles but the switch to handicap company and a step up to an extended 2m3f saw him run out a ready winner at Wetherby two weeks ago; looked a stayer on that occasion and there could be more to come over this trip; strong contender up 4lb.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner in December 2020; absent for 1,471 days prior to her return in December, showing some promise but beaten 22l or more in each of her four starts; last week's Southwell second was a fair effort but more will be needed to take this.
