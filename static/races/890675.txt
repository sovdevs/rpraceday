💬 Comment: In great form on the AW since Boxing Day (21411113); respected under his 7lb claimer
🔦 Spotlight: In great form on the AW since Boxing Day (21411113); dangerous to think the handicapper has his measure after a third of eight at Southwell (16.5f, Tapeta) three weeks ago; especially with Alfie Redman taking off a handy 7lb; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-01-30 at Southwell (AW) (16.5f): "I thought Sean was further back than ideal and I was panicking a little bit but once Further Measure came up the straight he just kept finding. He's been unlucky in some races when they haven't gone a pace so today was pleasing. He's entered at Wolverhampton on Monday but we'll see how he comes out of this, he's eight now and he's been a great servant for us. We originally bought him for the apprentices to ride and he's at a stage where he's enjoying life so we're all delighted - Mike Murphy, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Running consistently well on the AW in recent months; well worth another go over this far
🔦 Spotlight: Running consistently well on the AW in recent months with wins over 1m4f here and at Wolverhampton (Tapeta); only just beaten back here (1m5f) this month (splitting Dance Time and Poncho) and looks well worth another go over this far; stable also runs The Craftymaster.

💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner; capable of playing a part off this mark if somewhere near his best
🔦 Spotlight: Won seven times on the AW between December 2023 and March last year, including twice over C&D; recent form rather patchy but capable of playing a part off this mark if somewhere near his best.
Horse quote: 2024-03-05 at Southwell (AW) (16.5f): "The Craftymaster has been a revelation. He used to be slow, but stayed. Now, when that was going to turn into a sprint, I was thinking you can't go wide as you'll never win, so just wait and see if you outstay them. He's put them to bed in half a furlong with his injection of speed. He's learning and getting better at everything he does. This was the first test of his mettle, a full field with horses who have been in very good form and he's up to it. I don't feel I'm at the bottom of him yet - I feel if something came at him he'd go again -  William Carson, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
