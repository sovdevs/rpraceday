🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three nursery wins last year, including C&D; running well in defeat this year; e-w shout
🔦 Spotlight: Won three Class 6 nurseries last year, including C&D, and she's run some good races this time around too; beaten half a length into third (of four) over C&D three weeks ago, ending up quite wide given the small field; each-way shout.

🔦 Spotlight: Two wins in 5f AW handicaps, the latest in March (off 2lb lower) after a three-month break; not so good on turf at Catterick six weeks ago but returning to AW should help.

🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from ten starts as a 2yo, namely a 5.7f heavy-ground nursery at Bath in October; held her form afterwards and could yet prove better than this mark; betting to guide now starting out for Tony Carroll (same owner).
