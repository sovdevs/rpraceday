🔦 Spotlight: Sole juvenile win came over 1m at Haydock in August; good fourth in Listed race next time and might have been unsuited by soft ground when well held in Group 2 Royal Lodge at Newmarket final start; may still have untapped potential and must be considered on AW debut/reappearance.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-3 last term but he showed plenty of promise, finishing fourth in 6f Group 3 on debut and arguably unlucky not to win 1m maiden at Naas on final start; well up to winning races this season and he's a rare British raider for his in-form Irish stable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bath scorer last term; faces stiff task on the ratings and would be a surprise winner
🔦 Spotlight: Won a sprint maiden at Bath last term and finished the campaign with a good fourth in 7f York novice; will probably stay 1m but he faces a stiff task on the ratings and would be a surprise winner on his reappearance.
