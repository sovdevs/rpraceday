🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ended last season with a four-timer; watch the market on return from seven months off
🔦 Spotlight: Improved plenty as she went up in trip last year, rattling off a four-timer over 1m2f-11.5f, including a win here (1m3f); returns from seven months off and is now 28lb higher than when the sequence began, but there is no telling how much she still has left; market revealing.

💬 Comment: Won at Kempton and Ascot last autumn; off seven months; market useful on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive in three novices last year, winning at Kempton (1m4f, Polytrack) in September and under a penalty at Ascot (1m4f, soft) the following month; makes her handicap debut after seven months off and, like many of these, the market should indicate what is expected.

🔦 Spotlight: Record in handicaps last year read 5122221; beaten a neck by Overture at Yarmouth (11.5f, good to firm) in September, but a rise for her subsequent Nottingham success (1m6f, heavy) means she is 1lb worse off; handles Tapeta and still considered, especially if market is positive after 200 days off.

🔦 Spotlight: Bolted up by 8l in an uncompetitive Ripon novice (1m4f, soft) last September but her form doesn't match up to a few of these; she does hold a fitness advantage, though, having finished a creditable fourth of nine in a Thirsk handicap (1m4f, good) 15 days ago; two of her siblings and her dam won on the AW.
