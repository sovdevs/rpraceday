🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Class act back in the day and did win his penultimate start in points
🔦 Spotlight: Class act back in the day and took care of the odds-on favourite in his penultimate point; was a remote second when refusing late on in his last, though the winner was the still-useful Allmankind; dropping back to 2m4f should be favourable.
