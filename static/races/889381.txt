🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner who makes hurdle debut in a race lacking depth; firmly in calculations
🔦 Spotlight: Won the second of his three bumpers (all 2m on good) and runner-up in the other two (2m, good); makes hurdle debut in a race lacking depth and he's a major player if fully tuned up on first run since last September.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to shine under rules but this point runner-up is in top hands and capable of better
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten on hurdle debut at Ascot (2m5f, good to soft; albeit a warm race) and unseated mid-race at Hereford (2m3f, good) three weeks ago; however, the drop in trip could suit this headstrong point runner-up, who is in top hands (yard also runs Katana) and should appreciate this left-handed track; chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner; well beaten on hurdle debut but wind op since and not written off
🔦 Spotlight: Easily made all in Catterick bumper (1m7f, good) in November on second start; the strength of that form is questionable and he was well beaten on hurdle debut at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft) in January, but he's had wind surgery since and is not written off.
