🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual-purpose, sound effort over this trip latest, the market should reveal expectations
🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard; dual-purpose mare is 1-15 on turf on the Flat; sound effort on latest when a 2.5l third of 10 over this trip at Gowran on testing ground; handles a sounder surface but ran poorly on her only previous visit to this track (10.5f, soft); the market should reveal expectations.
Horse quote: 2024-09-23 at Sedgefield (17f): "Dumb Love is rated 60-odd on the Flat and runs over a mile and a quarter, so I knew she'd have the pace. A good friend of mine works for Ger, so he told me all about her. He said 'don't be hanging around, drive her on from the top of the hill' and he was right - Brian Hughes, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Winning hurdler is 0-13 on turf on the Flat but she did show signs of life when fourth of 10 on bottomless ground at Gowran (13.5f) on latest; down 2lb for that and she handles better ground; not one for maximum faith but she'd have a chance on a going day.
Horse quote: 2024-01-01 at Tramore (17f): "When in doubt, call Flanagan! He gave Bynx a masterclass of a ride and got the fractions spot on in that ground - Martin Hassett, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Winning hurdler is 0-6 on the Flat; arrives here on the back of a confidence boosting victory over timber at Clonmel (2m1f, gd-yld); her Flat form is pretty poor, however, and she ran poorly here over 10.5f last May; others preferred.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose sort is a 0-7 on turf on the Flat; won a 2m4f handicap hurdle on yielding at Fairyhouse in December; well beaten favourite on latest Flat start on the AW in January and has been off since; more needed and may need this run.
Horse quote: 2024-11-12 at Fairyhouse (20.5f): "Portarlington didn't really come down the hill on quick ground at Limerick but he was suited by today. We might go at Navan on Sunday, it's only 2m but it's a stiff track - Ian Donoghue, trainer."

💬 Comment: Runner up twice at around this trip last season, worth a 📊 market check on return
🔦 Spotlight: Seventeen race maiden is 0-15 on turf; twice a runner up last season at around this trip at Navan and Down Royal, both on good ground; off since heavy defeat on yielding back at Navan in October; not fully discounted and worth a 📊 market check on return for yard that does well here.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; two-time Flat turf winner but no success since winning off 59 at Ballinrobe in 2022; 5lb lower now but ran just once on the level last season at Ballinrobe in June and he's been off the track since; can only be watched.
Horse quote: 2018-10-22 at Pontefract (12f): "Beer With The Boys jumped well and travelled nicely through the race. He stayed on well in the home straight and won quite cosily - Andrea Atzeni, jockey."
