🔦 Spotlight: Bought for 1,000,000gns as a yearling, though cost 100,000gns when changing hands last May; off the mark at second attempt when winning a 1m novice at Southwell in November (second and third have both won since); down in trip but a contender back on turf.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won 7f AW maiden on debut and decent second in a 7f Redcar maiden latest; should go well
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning debut in a 7f maiden at Newcastle in March and sound run on turf debut when runner-up in a Redcar novice last time (7f, good to firm); should go well again.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "We thought a fair bit of Camino Del Ray last year but we never ran him - he's a big horse and took him a while to come to hand. Today was an educational day, they've kicked a long way out and my lad just stays all day. He showed plenty of greenness but it all came good towards the end and he'll improve plenty from that - Ryan Sexton, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
