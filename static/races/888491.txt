🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 13-2 for debut here 15 days ago where he overcame evident inexperience to win easily
🔦 Spotlight: 13-2 fourth favourite for his debut here (1m) 15 days ago where his chance looked slim 2f out, only for the penny to drop in the final furlong and he eventually ran out an easy winner (runner-up, who was conceding 6lb, beat Warrant Holder beforehand); bred to stay this trip well and he should be more clued up this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Palpably green on his debut here (1m) six weeks ago and did well to finish second in the end, beaten a head behind one who has since chased home Rahiebb (who received 6lb); bred to relish the longer trip and he's open to plenty of improvement; good chance.
