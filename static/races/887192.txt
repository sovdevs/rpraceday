🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11l win at Lingfield last week; tough to beat under penalty if repeating that form
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who returned to his very best with 11l win at Lingfield (2m7f, soft) last Thursday; needs to prove that level of performance was no one-off, but he'll be tough to beat under a 7lb penalty if repeating the form.

🔦 Spotlight: Won over hurdles at Fontwell (2m5f, good) last May and encouraging fourth of 14 on chase debut at Taunton (2m7f, good to soft) last month, when making a bad mistake three out; also effective on soft ground; 🔍 unexposed over staying trips and can be in the mix if minimising the blunders.

💬 Comment: Won with these cheekpieces back on at Hereford and remains well treated back up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: With these cheekpieces back on he got off the mark over fences at the 14th attempt at Hereford (3m1f, good to soft) a fortnight ago; back up 5lb he remains well treated on form as recent as last spring (including on soft ground) and he could play another leading role.
