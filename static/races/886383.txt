🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in two 7f events on Polytrack this winter; sets clear standard; 6f should be fine
🔦 Spotlight: In need of the experience on his 2yo debut last summer (7f, good to firm); two promising efforts on AW this winter, finishing second at Lingfield and Kempton (both 7f); sets a clear standard for his rivals to aim at and looks pacy enough to be fully effective at 6f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No match for an easy winner over C&D last month but it was more promising than his debut
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten in one 2yo start but he was strong in the market prior to his reappearance over C&D two weeks ago and offered more, albeit put in his place by the easy winner; may do better again but such progress is a must.
