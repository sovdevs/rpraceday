🔦 Spotlight: 14,000gns yearling by Dandy Man; first foal; dam runner-up over 6f at two (RPR 68) out of 1m-1m2f winning half-sister to 5f Group 3 winner Dolled Up; made a good start when second over C&D (good to firm) 18 days ago, despite looking in need of the experience; the clear form pick of the two to have run and he sets a solid standard to aim at.
