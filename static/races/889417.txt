💬 Comment: Worth considering now reverting to hurdles back on a winnable mark for his in-form stable.
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner over hurdles, all at around this distance on good ground; gained a first chase win in September but has not had things go to plan since and was last seen pulling up at Kelso in October; has gone well back from a break in the past and he's worth considering now back on a winnable mark for his in-form stable.
