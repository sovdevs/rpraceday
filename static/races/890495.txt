🔦 Spotlight: Won four times earlier in the season (2m5f/2m4f, good/good to soft) and, following a below-par spell, he was an encouraging fifth at Newbury (2m4f, good) recently; could build on that latest effort and top trainer has won four of the last seven runnings of this race; firmly in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only third at Kelso when bidding for hat-trick but this 🔍 unexposed 7yo remains of interest
🔦 Spotlight: Made all at Kempton (2m4f, good) in December on second chase start and followed up at Warwick (2m4f, good to soft); only third of five at Kelso (2m5f, good to soft) since but that was still a fair run and this 🔍 unexposed 7yo remains of interest, especially with the Warwick form reading well.
Horse quote: 2025-01-20 at Warwick (20f): "I'd say we got racing a little bit down the back. Leader In The Park's jumping was fantastic and we were always landing on the front foot. I managed to fill him up turning for home and I thought Nico [De Boinville, on Southoftheborder] might have kept me company, but he dropped off. He was in front a long way out on his own, he was probably a little bit tired but he was having a good look around more than anything. It took a while for everything to click but he's growing in confidence. If something came upsides coming down to the last I think he'd have found more. He's still novicey and it was only his third run over fences so there's certainly improvement to come. He deserves a crack at a big one - Ben Jones, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4-4 over fences before Uttoxeter flop, but this C&D winner could still be well treated
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 4-4 over fences in convincing fashion at Kelso (2m5f, good to soft) on March 1; beaten before stamina may have been an issue at Uttoxeter (3m, good to soft) four weeks ago and needs to bounce back, but perhaps that run came too soon; this C&D winner could still be well handicapped.
Horse quote: 2025-02-11 at Ayr (20.5f): "Going an extra half mile in trip really put Walk On Quest back into his comfort zone. He'd won twice over two miles and he just looked like an out-and-out stayer every time he won - Alan Doyle, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2024-07-20 at Market Rasen (21.5f): "Sure Touch is a remarkable little horse. I absolutely couldn't have imagined this at all. He was running around in novice hurdles two summers ago and has just progressed, progressed and progressed. I was always very confident to be honest, considering he went off at 14-1.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good second in the Grand Sefton last November when last seen, and has won when fresh
🔦 Spotlight: Some good runs in defeat last May-November, finishing second in the Grand Sefton at Aintree (2m5f, good to soft) when last seen; also effective on good ground; lacks a recent outing but has won when fresh in the past and he'll be a major player if resuming where he left off.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Aintree (21f): "The Topham Chase in the spring and this race again next year would be Vintage Fizz's targets if he gets his ground again. The Becher Chase would be too far for him so he'll have his holiday now and come back in the spring - Jedd O'Keeffe, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointing the last twice but good third in this 12 months ago and not written off
🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing the last twice and has to leave those runs miles behind; however, he won at Haydock (2m, soft) in January and was a good third in this last year (soft); also effective on good/good to soft; not written off.
Horse quote: 2025-01-18 at Haydock (16.5f): "Prairie Wolf has gone over a shorter trip because of the ground. He was running a strong race at Carlisle , it was just one of those racing errors. I'd like to think he can go and win a couple more this season and the two-and-a-half mile handicap at the Cheltenham Festival would be the aim - Joel Parkinson, joint-trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Wetherby (19.5f): "Densworth is a very nice horse. He blew up at Aintree and today he's done it nicely in the end. He got  in a bit tight at the second-last but he knew what he was doing with his feet - Callum Pritchard, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has back-class and his sights are lowered, but he's been pulled up the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Promising start to chasing career in late 2022, and returned from long absence with fair sixth over hurdles this winter; yard won this last year and he has his sights lowered after tackling the Kim Muir last month, but he's now been pulled up over fences the last twice and has something to prove.
Horse quote: 2022-10-28 at Wetherby (24f): "We just wanted a clear round and we didn't want Gelino Bello to be in front. The ideal thing would have been for Press Your Luck giving us a lead. It was always going to be a sprint and I could read Harry's mind, he didn't want to go and fire him at the last and put him on the floor.  The most important thing was to jump round, it's been so hard to do much schooling on grass at home, that's probably the first time he's jumped fences on grass. The first run is always a bit of experience and that was perfect. He'll keep improving and he'll probably go to Newbury next and then go to Kempton, right handed might suit him. He'll improve tons in a better race. He's a proper staying chaser, when they go a good gallop in a good race it will suit him a lot better- Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two chase wins last term & he's below his last winning mark, but has struggled this season
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice last season (2m1f/2m2f, good to soft) and he's dropped below his last winning mark; this 7yo represents Nicky Henderson and has plenty of time to get his career back on track but he's struggled this season, most recently back over hurdles in first-time blinkers; cheekpieces now go on.
Horse quote: 2024-03-16 at Kempton (18f): "Persian Time didn't want a cut at his fences at Cheltenham last time, but was much happier today. Nico said he tanked to the start and down to the first and you could tell he was a different horse after three fences today than last time. He's a nice horse who is going the right way. There'll be plenty more for him this season and I know the owners like Ayr's Scottish National meeting, where he ran well in a novice hurdle last year - Nicky Henderson, trainer"
