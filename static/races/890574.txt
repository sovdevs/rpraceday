🔦 Spotlight: Winning for a fourth time at this track when staying on best over this trip a month ago; has another 5lb to deal with but looks sure to put up another bold show.
Horse quote: 2025-03-23 at Carlisle (20f): "Hello Judge is is a lovely big, strong horse. He ran over three miles last time here but he's a two-and-a-half miler. It's a nice prize and this is the first time we've won one of the finals. We declared him for Hexham on Tuesday, thinking the ground here would be too quick - he'll not go there now! - Ian Hamilton, owner and trainer's husband."

💬 Comment: Has gone up 5lb for winning at Hexham and this has the look of a better race
🔦 Spotlight: Visored first-time when digging deep to win at Hexham (2m4f, good to soft) last month but this is a higher grade race and he's gone up 5lb.
Horse quote: 2023-03-25 at Kelso (26f): "Jet Legs had no weight on his back and a good 5lb claimer. He's a nice horse for the future. He's a laid-back character, a good traveller through the race. His owners have been very patient, you'll see the best of him as a staying chaser; Martin Todhunter, trainer."
