üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Highly üìà progressive sort, an emphatic winner at Cheltenham, big chance if handling ground
üî¶ Spotlight: Has made an excellent transition to chasing, with handicap wins at Aintree (good) and Cheltenham (extended 3m1f, good to soft); kept ticking over with a hurdles run before landing the revamped National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham; won on testing ground as a hurdler, but at a fairly modest level; might not be ideally suited by this going.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (30f): "Haiti Couleurs is such a tough horse. He wouldn't be overly speedy, he'll just gallop all day long. His jumping is so quick and accurate - Rebecca Curtis, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: Not far off Haiti Couleurs when falling at second-last at Cheltenham, suitable trip/ground
üî¶ Spotlight: 2023 point winner; won a 3m Grade 2 novice hurdle on heavy at Haydock last season; shaped promisingly on fourth chase start, when not far off today's rival Kinturk Kalanisi and subsequent Scottish National winner Captain Cody at Navan; around two lengths off Haiti Couleurs when falling at the second-last at Cheltenham; a leading contender.
Horse quote: 2024-02-17 at Haydock (24.5f): "It's a big thing to Now Is The Hour as he really enjoys this type of ground. I've got into a nice rhythm and he's come home well. He's a nice prospect - Sean Flanagan, jockey."

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Possibly in front too long when touched off by Daily Present in the Kim Muir, good chance
üî¶ Spotlight: Chase debut win in three-runner novice at Carlisle (2m4f, good to soft) in October; then campaigned in Graded races prior to handicap debut in the Kim Muir; travelled powerfully to lead nearing two out, perhaps much sooner than Derek O'Connor would have liked; lost out to Daily Present then but can be rated a strong contender.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (26f): "You're always disappointed not to win but Johnnywho ran very well. He pulled two shoes off, which might not have helped, but that's the way it goes - Jonjo O'Neill, joint-trainer."

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Grade 2 winner at Limerick in December, has confirmed a high standard in smart company
üî¶ Spotlight: Dominant winner of a 2m6f Grade 2 mares' novice at Limerick at Christmas; a month later finished a clear second behind Dancing City in 3m1f Grade 3 at Naas; another solid run behind the useful Spindleberry here last time; riding plans imply a high rank in stable estimation.
Horse quote: 2024-12-27 at Limerick (22.5f): "Bioluminescence's jumping is unbelievable. She's a big mare with a huge jump to match ? it's her forte. A trip on soft ground is her ideal. I rode her in her point-to-point and she was flawless that day, too. Gavin [Cromwell] has trained her exceptionally well, winning a Grade 3 over hurdles and now a Grade 2 over fences. It's a fair step to go into a Grade 2 first time over fences. She's a ferocious galloper, stayer and jumper and because she's so big, there's a little bit left there - Derek O'Connor, rider"

üí¨ Comment: Beat Johnnywho narrowly in the Kim Muir, could be in the mix again with help of 5lb claim.
üî¶ Spotlight: Pulled up in this last year after finishing fifth in the Kim Muir; improved form this season, third in the Porterstown here on reappearance; same placing over a shorter trip at Punchestown; found plenty on the run-in to beat Johnnywho in the Kim Muir, the pair drawing clear of Sa Majeste; could be in the mix again with the help of Aidan Kelly's claim.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (26f): "Daily Present is a stayer, but he was too free in the race last year. The ride that chap gave him was great as he never left the inside. He just had to try and keep on filling him. He was brilliant on him. I definitely thought Johnnywho was coming back, but I knew my lad would stay, however when I saw Derek (O'Connor) rallying I thought we were done. In fairness to this lad the last race he won at Down Royal he looked like he was going to be fourth, but he stayed on as if he wanted four miles. We are just so delighted. That was the lad's first ride in England. He is a super rider that is loaded with talent, and what a pair of hands he has. I just thought he was super on him - Paul Nolan, trainer."

üî¶ Spotlight: Most recent of four chase wins when scoring by 10l over an extended 3m3f on soft at Cheltenham in November 2023; ran creditably when second in 3m Listed mares' chase on heavy at Exeter in February; game display when best of the Irish in third behind Myretown in the Ultima at Cheltenham; helps to give her trainer a strong hand.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (25f): "Malina Girl has been a great little mare. She is quite small, but she is very game and always tries very hard. She stumbled at the second and almost came down. It took her quite a while to get her confidence back, but she stayed on really well. It is not completely confirmed, but she might just go to stud now. She has been a brilliant mare and that might be the plan now - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-11-23 at Thurles (23f): "Will Do is better the further he goes and that ground is probably as good as he wants it - Jack Kennedy, rider."

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: üìà progressive last season, flopped at Punchestown before Naas win in first-time cheekpieces
üî¶ Spotlight: Won three of his last four starts last season, culminating in a valuable novice handicap win at Navan; ran respectably without the benefit of a run when fifth in the Thyestes, weakening after a bad mistake two out; flopped when favourite for National Trial at Punchestown; redeemed himself with Leinster National win in first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-03-23 at Navan (23.5f): "I was delighted with Bushmans Pass. It was a good battle. I love a good battle when I win it, but I wouldn't like to be second in a battle like that! If the ground was soft at Punchestown there is a 3m6f race and he'd definitely go there. We're delighted with that. He's coming along, the handicapper wasn't easy on him early on - Oliver McKiernan, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: Twice placed in the Grand National, second in this last year, faces tough task at 13
üî¶ Spotlight: Twice placed in the Grand National; most recent win was in a Grade 2 chase at Navan two seasons ago; took time to find his form last season before being produced in fighting shape to finish a gallant second to Intense Raffles in this; could peak again now after two prep runs but no horse of his age has won this since Overshadow in 1953.
Horse quote: 2023-03-20 at Navan (20.5f): "Any Second Now did it nicely and didn't do any more than he had to. Denis was very happy with him. He popped away nicely, got under the last a bit, but when he grabbed hold of him after the last he quickened up well - Ted Walsh, trainer"

üî¶ Spotlight: Won last season's Grand National Trial at Haydock (3m4f, heavy) and creditable third of 18 behind Stuzzikini in the Troytown at Navan (3m, yielding) in November; prominent when unseating at the 14th in this year's Haydock's Grand National Trial; dropped away from two out in the National Hunt Chase; first-time blinkered.
Horse quote: 2024-02-17 at Haydock (28.5f): "I'm delighted with that. Yeah Man deserves that after a couple of defeats at Ascot. We weren't sure about the ground, but he got through it well. I'd say we'll go for the Irish National now. He wouldn't have got into it off his current mark but he will get in now - that's the target. I think we'll skip Cheltenham - he may have an entry in the Kim Muir but I'd say he's most likely to go for the Irish National - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: Only chase win was in a beginners' event in 2022, fair third to Bushmans Pass at Naas
üî¶ Spotlight: Only chase win was in a beginners' event at Punchestown in 2022; best handicap form represented by second placing in 27-runner Paddy Power at Leopardstown last season; disappointed when 7-1 chance in same event this season; much better when third to Bushmans Pass in the Leinster National.
Horse quote: 2022-05-29 at Punchestown (24f): "We only decided after Panda Boy ran here at the Festival to go chasing with him. I always felt he was a good-ground horse. His action always suggested to me that he wanted decent ground and chasing is his game. We may give him a little break now - Martin Brassil, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-11-25 at Punchestown (24f): "Favori De Champdou came on from the last day and we knew he had, but I thought that would be tougher. Jack said he stayed very well and jumped brilliant. It was a hot enough race and he's a nice horse - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-01-11 at Clonmel (16.5f): "Quai De Bourbon is a good jumper but the hurdles are a bit small for him. It turned into a bit of a staying race on the testing ground. He is going to be a stayer - Paul Townend, rider."

üí¨ Comment: Unseated rider at 15th when 8-1 for the Kim Muir, renews rivalry with the first three
üî¶ Spotlight: 2-6 over hurdles, rated 137; has reached the same mark over fences despite failing to win in five attempts; fair effort when third over 2m6f at Punchestown in February; among the leading fancies (8-1) for the Kim Muir, made a bad mistake at the 15th and unseated rider; renews rivalry with the first three home.
Horse quote: 2023-09-30 at Gowran Park (20f): "Mint Boy had a couple of good runs in bumpers last year. He was probably just a big, weak horse at Fairyhouse. It was a good performance and he got the hang of it jumping wise. He'll be a nice horse in time - Keith Donoghue, jockey."

Horse quote: 2022-04-18 at Fairyhouse (29f): "Our plan was to jump Lord Lariat out, but I was a bit concerned about getting the trip. We wanted to utilise his jumping as he is a good jumper. Paddy said he got plenty of breathers into him and it all worked out well - Dermot McLoughlin, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: Long-priced winner on stable debut, maintained revival in form with Ulster National win
üî¶ Spotlight: Beaten a short head in 2023 Thyestes; started last season brightly with Troytown fourth but pulled up in three big handicaps afterwards; surprise winner on debut for üÜï new yard in 2m4f Navan handicap hurdle early last month; maintained his revival with victory over Final Order in the 3m5f Ulster National; 8lb penalty makes this difficult.
Horse quote: 2025-03-30 at Downpatrick (28.5f): "Coming out of the back I wanted to nick a few lengths because Dunboyne kind of slowed up down the hill, he didn't like going down the hills. It's a great race to win, I had a double this day last year - James Smith, jockey, speaking to Racing TV"

üî¶ Spotlight: Began his chasing career brightly with a defeat of Sa Majeste at Galway last October and ran well in small-field Graded races; disappointing on handicap debut at Leopardstown (2m5f, yielding) in February; needs to jump better than when beaten 20l in seventh in the Ultima at Cheltenham.
Horse quote: 2024-02-15 at Clonmel (24f): "Search For Glory did it well in the end, he just didn't enjoy being in front. He probably showed more gears than he every showed there - Jack Kennedy, rider"

üí¨ Comment: Has run only three times over fences, won over 2m4f at Gowran, possible stamina issues
üî¶ Spotlight: Smart novice hurdler two seasons ago; has run only three times over fences and probably needed his first run back after a long absence; won over 2m4f at Gowran before outstayed behind Fun Fun Fun in 3m Grade 3 at Limerick; possible stamina issues.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Gowran Park (20f): "We had hoped Harry Des Ongrais would run well. He ran well at Fairyhouse and two miles is probably a bit sharp so the step up in trip suited him. He saw it out well and Rachael said he jumps brilliant. You have to have three runs for a handicap so we'll have to see - Henry De Bromhead, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: No further success since winning the 2023 Kerry National, makes little appeal
üî¶ Spotlight: No further success since winning the 2023 Kerry National; pulled up in his repeat bid last September; best run this season when third off his lower hurdles mark at Punchestown in November; makes little appeal.
Horse quote: 2023-09-20 at Listowel (24f): "Ricky gave him a fantastic ride. He was always in a good position, knowing that Desertmore House would not quicken for you in a hurry but stays very well. His jumping is very sound for a novice and it couldn't have gone any better. He's a lovely horse. He was bought originally by John Reddington for him to ride in bumpers, and John had a couple of great spins on him. But I always felt he would be at his best when he started going further and jumping fences. The Grand National might well end up being the long-term aim for him, we would have to start thinking about those sorts of races. I ran him in this for the experience, hoping he'd run well. He's passed a couple of tests out there today - Martin Brassil, trainer."

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: 0-6 over fences, lacks a recent run and faces a massive task in a race of this standard
üî¶ Spotlight: Two wins over hurdles; 0-6 over fences, runner-up three times, best effort when going very close in the Galway Blazers last August; lacks a recent run and faces a massive task in a race of this standard.
Horse quote: 2023-06-17 at Downpatrick (17.5f): "Moonovercloon is a tricky horse. He didn't want to go today. James gave him a good ride because he never travelled for him. He has ability though - Matthew Smith, trainer."
