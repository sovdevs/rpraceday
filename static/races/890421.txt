🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Consistent last year and a bold show is likely if she's ready to roll after six months off
🔦 Spotlight: Largely consistent record last year, including a win at Beverley (extended 1m, good to firm) in August; ended her season with creditable in-frame efforts over 1m on soft ground at Redcar and Newmarket; bold show likely if ready to roll after six months off.
Horse quote: 2024-08-31 at Beverley (8.5f): "Zapphire is not winning out of turn. She's not entirely straightforward but she has a decent level of ability. I popped her in a fillies' handicap in a fortnight at Leopardstown and that might be interesting. She loves soft ground so if it rained over there we'd be even happier - Steve Brown, trainer's husband and assistant."

🔦 Spotlight: Well below par on final two starts but recorded two good placed efforts over 1m2f at York (good/good to soft) off 3lb higher at the start of last summer, including on reappearance; good shout if resuming in similar form.

💬 Comment: Won in blinkers in Ireland last year but ended 2024 out of form; blinkers off for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at Cork (1m, yielding) last October in first-time blinkers, added to regular tongue-tie,  but the effect of the headgear had worn off by the end of the year; resumes for 🆕 new yard, minus the blinkers; the betting is perhaps the best guide to expectations.

🔦 Spotlight: Did well for Katie Scott last year, winning handicaps at Carlisle (1m, soft) and Hamilton (1m1f, good to soft) in September; sound return to action when fifth of 12 on AW at Southwell (1m) 15 days ago and should be spot on for this.
