🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bettered poor handicap debut when third at Taunton this month; visor may aid more progress
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up over 2m5f here on last month's handicap debut but fared much better when keeping-on third at Taunton (2m3f, good); a fortnight ago; made his jockey work very hard on that recent outing but is a 🔥 big player if the first-time visor helps to keep him motivated.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed twice off higher marks last spring and might have needed recent return run
🔦 Spotlight: Made low-key return from 260-day absence at Taunton (2m3f, good; behind Mach Ten) a fortnight ago and is now 0-8 over hurdles but was placed off higher marks in two 2m handicaps (both on good) last spring and has good claims here if judged on those exploits.

🔦 Spotlight: Won over fences in 2023 but is 0-17 over hurdles; returned from six-month break with two good efforts on soft ground this winter (2m2f chase/2m hurdle) but his hurdle run here (1m7f, good to soft) 18 days ago was disappointing and he has become rather frustrating.

🔦 Spotlight: Not seen over hurdles since respectable fourth on handicap debut at Newton Abbot (2m1f, good) last August but she won a 2m AW race on Boxing Day and, with her Flat stamina in mind, she's of interest over a new trip.
