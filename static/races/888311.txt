🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only beaten 6l on recent handicap debut and dropping back in trip could be beneficial
🔦 Spotlight: Winning pointer who started out under rules with positive runs and got back on track when a 6l third on his recent handicap debut at Doncaster (2m5f, good); raced freely that day so dropping back in trip might be a good thing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointing since winning his novice but this handicap looks easier than his first
🔦 Spotlight: Made successful return in a winnable 2m novice at Plumpton (good to soft; first-time hood) and essentially disappointing since, including on his handicap debut last time at Kempton (2m5f, good to soft); this should be easier and he remains lightly raced.
