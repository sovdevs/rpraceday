🔦 Spotlight: Had a straightforward task in weak novice event at Newcastle (1m, AW) when last seen but scored by a very wide margin, taking form figures to 221; bred to rate higher still and take well to Ascot, being half-brother to Palace Pier whose Group 1 haul featured two wins here; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent AW form is respectable; however, still seeking first win on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time AW winner whose recent form suggests his turn is near; however, he's 0-8 on turf and returns to this sphere off a difficult mark; not the percentage call.
Horse quote: 2023-09-09 at Kempton (AW) (7f): "Brasil Power was drawn 13 and George Boughey left it up to me. It was only in the stalls that I decided to drop him in and I'm surprised how quickly he got to the front. He's obviously a horse with ability and he likes the AW. It was a good performance - Callum Shepherd, jockey."

💬 Comment: Successful in last year's Golden Mile; has possibilities in this lower grade
🔦 Spotlight: Registered sole win for current yard in last year's Golden Mile at Glorious Goodwood; placed in the Cambridgeshire; possibilities in this lower grade with Lincoln reappearance under his belt.
Horse quote: 2024-09-28 at Newmarket (9f): "As I said before the race, Toimy Son is in the form of his life. It was not ideal today with the ground becoming a bit tacky, and he is probably better at a mile, but he's run another stormer. He's in the Balmoral Handicap on Champions Day and that's where we'll go with him - David Menuisier, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-08-26 at Newmarket (July) (8f): "Yantarni was entitled to win like that on his previous form. He had a break after his all-weather campaign and has since been gelded. William said he thought this trip was as far as he wants to go just now - Alex Merriam, assistant trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-06-07 at Newbury (6.5f): "Pat (Dobbs) was confident about the trip for Son, although the ground was an unknown. Royal Ascot is a standing joke when you have a horse run well leading up to it and we'll discuss it. Either way we've got a nice horse - Julie Wood, owner."
