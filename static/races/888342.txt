🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came home strongly over 2m4f here on chase debut and predictably goes further now
🔦 Spotlight: Won his sole hurdle start in France; well beaten in two handicaps for this yard but turned things around big time on his recent chase debut here (2m4f, soft) where he came home strongly after getting outpaced; only up 4lb and today's stiffer stamina test looks sure to suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Only his second run over fences when pulling clear at Hereford (3m1f, good to soft) and conditions looked slower than the official good to soft when fourth at Wincanton, though he wasn't beaten at all far; remains of interest.

🔦 Spotlight: Would have found soft ground against him when returning from a break at Taunton and he's only 1lb higher than for last May's win on good at Stratford (2m6f); must have a shout with Sean Bowen back aboard, having triumphed the last time they teamed up.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A 5lb rise for last time (2m3f) seems fair and 2m6f will be within range
🔦 Spotlight: Twice runner-up earlier in the season and came good with a decisive win at Exeter (2m3f, good to soft), having previously looked a non-stayer over 3m1f; a 5lb rise for last time seems fair and 2m6f will be within range.
