🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise in maiden hurdles and was going to have a big say before a fall on h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in a couple of his maiden hurdle starts and looked likely to have a big say in the finish before a late fall on handicap debut at Fairyhouse earlier this month; went off 6-4 for that contest and looks like a 🔥 big player from the same mark; wears first-time hood.
