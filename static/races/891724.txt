🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Outclassed last time; bumper/maiden winner with clear form claims at this level
🔦 Spotlight: 100-1 for the Grade 2 Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham and performed accordingly; has won a bumper and a 2m3f maiden at Punchestown (both in the mud) and has clear form claims at this level.
Horse quote: 2025-01-13 at Punchestown (19.5f): "Magic McColgan just got progressively worse in hanging and jumping left. They went a good gallop and she appreciated the step up in trip and slow ground. She is a fine mare and has a good jump in her - Paul Townend, rider."
