🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: British form is moving back in right direction; 2nd at Southwell (2m; evens) latest outing
🔦 Spotlight: Second on Irish debut last February makes it pretty surprising that he's now 0-8; however, his British form has been moving back in that direction and he was second at Southwell (2m, good to soft; evens) on latest outing; serious contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran out twice; confirmed plenty of ability next time; 2m7f didn't work out on latest start
🔦 Spotlight: Ran out two from home in consecutive races late last year; confirmed he has plenty of ability when third at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) in January, covered up as he made his way from rear, and raced too freely when upped to 2m7f for handicap debut at Ascot (good) six weeks ago; there's a big rethink on trip today and he is one of the top three on ratings.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 overall but second on a variety of ground at Fontwell (2m3f), Fakenham (2m) and Sandown (2m4f) in three consecutive starts this winter; flop in first-time cheekpieces here (extended 2m5f) last time is the big worry but he has a huge shout on those earlier performances.

💬 Comment: Hurdle debut was satisfactory; disappointed next time; none of his form looks good enough
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in three of his Irish points and minor honours in all three bumpers; while hurdling debut at Lingfield (2m, heavy) in January was satisfactory, he disappointed there (2m3f, soft) next time and none of his form makes him a leading contender today.
