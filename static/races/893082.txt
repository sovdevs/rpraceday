🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fell on return from layoff at Gowran, may have needed latest, chance if handles track
🔦 Spotlight: Two-time chase winner is 1-14 over timber; fell four out on return from a long layoff at Gowran (2m, soft); may have needed latest when weakening late at Limerick (2m3f, good); rated 23lb higher over fences but his best form is going right-handed; chance if he handles the track.
Horse quote: 2023-06-17 at Downpatrick (19.5f): "Bal Kauto is a lovely, sharp horse and jumps like a cat. We'll see how he comes out of it, he's in again at Wexford on Tuesday - Declan Queally, trainer."
