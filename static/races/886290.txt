💬 Comment: Impressed on chase debut in Ireland but disappointed on stable debut; tricky to weigh up
🔦 Spotlight: 🔍 unexposed 7yo who created a very good impression when winning easily on chasing debut for Willie Mullins at Navan (2m4f, heavy) in December 2023; struggled to get competitive in valuable Windsor conditions chase (2m6f) when reappearing for new stable last month and is tricky to weigh up at present but will find this race easier and may be aided by the new tongue-tie.

🔦 Spotlight: Produced excellent front-running performance in 15-runner handicap at Aintree festival (2m, soft) last April but has lacked the same sparkle this season, and his recent Kempton run was particularly disappointing; held up in rear in last two races; interesting to see whether connections opt to revert to front-running tactics here.
