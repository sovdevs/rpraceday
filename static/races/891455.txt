🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Speedy 2yo who returns having been ✂️ gelded and could go well on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Showed good pace when close fifth of 20 in sales race at York (6f, good to firm) last August and didn't run badly in 5f Listed race at Ayr next time; returns having been ✂️ gelded and he could go well on handicap debut.
Horse quote: 2024-06-29 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "We thought the world of Against The Wind into the spring. I was very confident he'd go and win at York first time as he was so professional at home but he got beat. First run you can always forgive with a little bit of greenness but he then got beaten again on his second start. I felt just dropping back to five [furlongs] and taking a lead would suit and he showed his quality today - Kevin Ryan, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won in first-time visor last month; disappointing since; could bounce back now blinkered
🔦 Spotlight: Easily made all in a first-time visor on handicap debut at Chelmsford (5f, AW) last month; failed to back that up when 10lb higher at Wolverhampton (5f, AW) last time but he now goes in blinkers and it will be no surprise if he bounces back with a bold show on his first turf start.

🔦 Spotlight: Won C&D novice (good to firm) last August for Stuart Williams; fair efforts at Wolverhampton (5f/6f, AW) this year on first two stable and handicap starts; she needs something extra today but the drop back in trip could be a plus (pulled hard last time) and she's not ruled out.
