🔦 Spotlight: Made his breakthrough at Redcar (6f, good to firm) last week, winning by 2l; carries a 5lb penalty today, under which he ran well when runner-up here (6f, good to firm) yesterday; he may be okay now back up in trip and could be involved.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Season's best form last week; yet to be confirmed what she's fully capable of on turf.
🔦 Spotlight: Last week's Wolverhampton second (7f) rates a season's best form effort; remains 5lb below her one winning mark, and it's a case of how much ability she can translate to turf (one inconclusive run thus far).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Near-3l seventh here latest doesn't tell whole story; course win number four may be near.
🔦 Spotlight: This month's near-3l seventh over 6f represented only the second time in 11 handicap starts at Brighton that she's failed to make at least the first four (has won three), but she hit the line strongly after zero luck in the run; 3lb below her last winning mark and her turn may be near.
Horse quote: 2024-08-09 at Brighton (6f): "I was a bit worried about the ground this morning because I was here yesterday when we had all that rain. Bear To Dream hadn't run for a while so I was worried about her getting caught out on that tacky ground, but she was obviously fitter than I thought she was. She's very straightforward. She does plenty at home and Kaiya's [Fraser] has given her a great ride. That's his first winner for us and we've been using him for a bit. He has a real nice way of riding - Michael Attwater, trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing"

🔦 Spotlight: August 2022 C&D win is one of three on his cv granted a sharp 7f on fast ground, but rather mixed returns on his visits here since; on a good mark, however, and this race is much easier than the 0-72 of his recent return.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still a largely untried quantity on turf but most recent Tapeta efforts don't inspire.
🔦 Spotlight: It remains to be seen what he is capable of on turf after just two novice events and a heavy-ground 1m handicap, all in 2023 (well held in each); trail has gone cold since an okay winter on Tapeta, however.
