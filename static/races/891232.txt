🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's mid-distance form makes her the one to beat if coping with drop in trip
🔦 Spotlight: A 375,000gns yearling; Lope De Vega filly holds the best form credentials on last season's turf form over middle-distances on various types of ground, best effort on final start when positively ridden second at the Curragh (1m4f); similar tactics likely here now dropped in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid enough maiden handicapper in Britain last year; new headgear combination tried
🔦 Spotlight: Generally consistent last term for Jane Chapple-Hyam, making frame in handicaps at Goodwood and Epsom at around this trip; ran badly in first-time cheekpieces final start at Newmarket; bought for 68,000gns at Newmarket December Sales and new headgear combination tried on yard/AW debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent comeback second augurs well but more likely needed to go one better
🔦 Spotlight: Made a promising debut over almost 1m2f at Gowran last summer but was well below that level twice after; back to similar level of form on last month's return here, forcing much of pace when beaten 0.5l in an admittedly weak maiden over 7f (Winsome third); step up in trip could suit here but this looks a stronger maiden.
