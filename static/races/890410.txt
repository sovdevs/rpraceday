Horse quote: 2023-10-28 at Doncaster (5f): "Aberama Gold seems to enjoy those conditions and we're lucky to have got him really. He ended up in Goodwood on this sort of ground, he won at York before that on better ground, but these are his sort of conditions by the looks of it. I don't know if we'll run him again this year. I'm not sure he's up to Listed class. He's a very good sprint handicapper and he's had a great year. I can't imagine he's going into next year well handicapped, but on these conditions, if you handle them it's probably worth a stone. We'll probably look for valuable sprint handicaps on bottomless ground - David O'Meara, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: Out of form when last seen October, but won 15-runner Class 4 Thirsk handicap last spring
üî¶ Spotlight: Out of form when last seen in October, but won 15-runner Class 4 Thirsk handicap last spring, and stable is among the winners; has run creditably in the last two runnings of the Great St Wilfrid over C&D; goes on most ground.
Horse quote: 2023-09-23 at Ayr (6f): "It means a lot because there was a lot of money on Wobwobwob. I don't know who they were but I'm glad they backed a winner. It's a great race to win and the Gold Cup is on my bucket list, so hopefully this lad is heading in that direction. He loves this type of ground and a fast pace to aim at, and he's won over seven so stays the six furlongs really well. Hopefully he's one for the Gold next year. They went very hard but that suited him and he had something to aim at - Adrian Keatley, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-10-21 at Doncaster (6f): "Dakota Gold loved the ground. He got headed and he fought back and he's still got that enthusiasm for it. He's tremendous. He's not as good as he was, you don't expect them to be, but he can still race to a good level.

üî¶ Spotlight: Had only five starts, winning twice (6f, soft/good to firm) including Class 4 Nottingham handicap last summer; off since August but both the wins came first up for the season; could progress again.
Horse quote: 2023-10-20 at Redcar (6f): "Valentine Catcher showed enough at home but first-time-out in those conditions, you'd think it wouldn't be ideal. He was a bit slow away and a bit green but he travelled nicely and got there quite easily. There's obviously plenty of potential there and I was quite impressed - David Allan, jockey."

Horse quote: 2023-07-12 at Lingfield (6f): "The Good Biscuit has backed up quite well. He was fresh and well on Monday morning so we thought this looked like a race we could win. He's got a good constitution so it was a straightforward decision after he ate up. One of his main rivals was taken out, but he still did it well. He went unsold so we brought him home, and he's probably had to run to about the same as he did last time, but when we go into nurseries it'll be tougher - Jack Channon, trainer."
