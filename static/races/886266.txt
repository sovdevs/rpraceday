🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Just a length ahead of Sea Presenting last time and this mare was better positioned
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner; now 0-6 over hurdles but three times a runner-up, latterly at Ludlow (2m5f) when just ahead of Sea Presenting; did get a more forward ride than the latter and she's no certainty to confirm those placings; still respected.
