🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 since the tongue-tie went on with both wins coming at Lingfield (1m/7f); 3lb wrong under a penalty for his win eight days ago, but at least as big a concern is stall 15.
Horse quote: 2024-07-09 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "Mister Mojito is still improving. I was a little disappointed with him last time at Newmarket, I don't think the ground was an issue, I just think he ended up getting behind the wrong horse and tactically we got it wrong. He came out of the race really well and I would have been a little bit disappointed if he wasn't involved today. He doesn't like soft ground but other than that he's not let us down - Terry Kent, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
