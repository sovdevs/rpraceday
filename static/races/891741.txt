🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Record of 1311 for 🆕 new yard; has a workable mark judged on best Flat form; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Absent since Plumpton novice win (2m4f) in November when taking record for 🆕 new yard to 1311; has a workable mark judged on best Flat form (useful) and warrants respect.
Horse quote: 2022-10-26 at Nottingham (14f): "Prince Imperial has had a light campaign, he's tough and wins on the all-weather so we'll keep him going through the winter. There'll be six runners in those two-mile races after Christmas so it makes sense to target them - Richard Hughes, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close in belatedly reapplied blinkers at Ludlow last time; difficult to dismiss
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who has inconsistent form this term but went close in belatedly reapplied blinkers at Ludlow (2m5f) most recently and is difficult to dismiss on the back of that effort.
Horse quote: 2024-01-05 at Ludlow (20f): "As Ballybegg has got older he's got a bit better and his own way of jumping fences. It's great to win another with him. The ground's sticky, hard work, but he's won well on it. He's a horse with ability which makes it easier - Richard Patrick, jockey."
