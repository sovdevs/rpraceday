🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-8 on turf, in decent form at Dundalk in recent months, racefit, chance if handles track
🔦 Spotlight: Twenty one race maiden is 0-8 on turf; has gone close at Dundalk a couple of times this year and was only beaten 2l there on latest last month over 5f; 6f is fine and she is racefit from the AW; chance if she handles this track.

💬 Comment: Maiden 0-2 on turf, has C&D form, lacks a recent run, best watched on stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Six-race maiden is 0-2 on turf; ran well on last two starts for Eoghan O'Neill a year ago, including over 6f at this venue (good); course form is always a plus here but she lacks a run and is probably best watched on stable debut.

Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Sligo (5.5f): "Gegenpressing loves these summer tracks and all four of his wins have come right-handed. I thought he got there too soon but he held on and, with a bit of luck, he might pick up another one or two off the marks he'll be off - Patrick Harty, joint trainer."

💬 Comment: Clear promise on h'cap debut latest at Bellewstown, stiffer test should suit, chance
🔦 Spotlight: Four-race maiden is 0-2 on turf; didn't cut much ice in maidens but clear promise on handicap debut at Bellewstown (5f, good) last month in a first-time tongue-tie (retained); this stiffer track will suit on that evidence; claims.

Horse quote: 2023-06-16 at Cork (7f): "Chica Power travelled well, picked up when Billy wanted to and was straightforward enough - Pat Martin, trainer."

💬 Comment: Last win off 5lb higher, promise on comeback on AW, strip fitter now, shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: 1-23 on turf, her sole win coming at Down Royal (5f, good) in July 2023; she is 5lb lower here and her comeback run at Dundalk (5f) wasn't devoid of promise (didn't get a clear run); should strip fitter for that and the step up in trip here is not a worry; shortlisted.

💬 Comment: 0-5 on turf, pulled up in a maiden hurdle latest, new headgear combo needs to transform
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 on turf; best effort came when a 4.25l third of 7 in a Tipperary maiden for her former yard on her second start (5f, soft); hasn't repeated that since and was pulled up in a Clonmel maiden hurdle when last seen in March; new headgear combination needs to have a dramatic effect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five wins at 1m, 5lb below last turf win, out of form, tongue-tie and blinkers on; reserve
🔦 Spotlight: Third reserve; 4-35 on the AW and 1-13 on turf; all five wins have come over 1m; is 5lb below last turf win at Leopardstown (1m, good) but has been out of form in four runs this year; best watched down in trip in first-time tongue-tie and blinkers.
Horse quote: 2023-11-03 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Feature This likes it up here. I was trying to get her to stay further but that's probably her trip. There was not much pace which probably suited her. She battled well and will probably keep going up here for the winter - Paul Flynn, trainer"
