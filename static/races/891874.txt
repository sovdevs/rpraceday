🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Prolific C&D winner, including latest, but has never followed up; hugely respected.
🔦 Spotlight: Has gained seven of his eight career wins over this C&D, including last time out; up 2lb for that and he's yet to successfully follow up any of his previous successes; nonetheless, he's hugely respected.

💬 Comment: 0-12; two creditable C&D efforts recently; visor back on and drops 1lb; could go close.
🔦 Spotlight: 0-12 but has produced two creditable C&D efforts in context on his last two starts; the better of those was in a first-time visor and that is now back on again, so that allied to a 1lb drop could help him to go close.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f and 8.5f Tapeta winner; below par last two starts; competitive mark but is unreliable.
🔦 Spotlight: 7f and 8.5f Tapeta winner; below par on his final start of last year and on his return at Wolverhampton; capable of being competitive from this mark but is not the most reliable.
Horse quote: 2022-03-12 at Wolverhampton (AW) (7f): "Meng Tian has improved a lot physically from two to three and Mr Woods was quite happy with him. The vibes were positive and he did well as he had a tricky old trip to come from the back. The leaders ran off the bend, which took us quite wide, so he's done well, but I was always confident and I don't see why he can't build on this - James Doyle, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f winner; down the field in two runs since latest wind surgery; hard to see him winning.
🔦 Spotlight: 7f winner on Polytrack and turf; has had several instances of wind surgery and has been down the field in two starts since the latest of those; steps up in trip, which should be fine but it takes a leap of faith to see him winning based on recent form.
Horse quote: 2023-04-20 at Newmarket (7f): "I think that was the ride of the meeting. Harry Magnus was drawn one at Goodwood first time out and he jumped right away from the field and he was then in no man's land. Seven furlongs suits him well but he has got a bit of speed. We could drop him back in trip as he might get quicker. He has been a bit green learning his job and he is not fully there yet - Charles Hills, trainer."
