🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reeled in Whosmaydaddy at Carlisle this month; player if in right mood again here
🔦 Spotlight: No longer the force of old but capitalised upon some help from the handicapper at Carlisle (3m, good) this month, keeping on well to reel in Whosmydaddy; can cope with recent 2lb nudge if in the right mood again.
Horse quote: 2022-03-07 at Leopardstown (21.5f): "Super Citizen loves this place and the race suited him, it obviously suited him last year and suited him this year. He's not a horse that usually pulls out a lot and I'd rather have seen him two lengths clear at the last. He's honest, jumps well and stays - Eugene O'Sullivan, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 6yo who was placed in Irish points in early 2024 and ended last year with two good-ground hurdle wins (2m/2m3f); not seen to same effect on heavy ground in January but is back on a sound surface for this chasing debut and looks a good prospect for fences; cheekpieces on.

🔦 Spotlight: Rewarded market support when battling well to win on chase/handicap debut at Doncaster (3m2f, good) in February; safely held twice since but was found to be coughing on first occasion and his latest run came in a competitive series final; may still have potential and can be given another chance.
