🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-7 on the Flat with Richard Hannon but showed a good level of form (rated 97) in competitive handicaps last year on easy ground; fast ground against him final start; ✂️ gelded since and obvious appeal here on hurdles debut for top yard.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising Naas debut run puts him in the mix; needs to settle better though
🔦 Spotlight: Landed a 1m6f handicap off a mark of 58 on his last start at Navan in October and outran his 28-1 odds on hurdles debut at Naas last month, seeing it out well considering he was plenty keen in front; Triumph Hurdle entry seems optimistic but has a future in this discipline.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Okay Leopardstown debut at Christmas when backed; likely more to come now in tongue-tie
🔦 Spotlight: Showed ability on the Flat in France for former yard; picked up for 62,000Euros at Arqana in July and ran well for long way on hurdles debut (backed) at Leopardstown over Christmas before understandably tiring; tongue-tie now fitted and improvement likely.
