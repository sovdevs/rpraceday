💬 Comment: 3-3 for current yard (all 6f on Tapeta) and has to be respected now back on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 3-3 for this yard (all over 6f on Tapeta) when scoring at Southwell last month; last season's turf performances left something to be desired but he's a five-time winner on grass who has to be respected.

🔦 Spotlight: Made handicap debut last May and enjoyed a 📈 progressive campaign with three wins, over 7f here (good to firm) in June and twice over 5f at Pontefract (soft) in October; this 4yo could still have more to offer and is capable of playing a leading role if fully tuned up on his reappearance.

Horse quote: 2024-06-08 at Catterick (7f): "Patontheback had a lovely run round. I thought if he doesn't win today he's never going to as everything went perfect for him.

💬 Comment: A return to form is needed but getting back on turf could help; on a handy mark
🔦 Spotlight: Twice had issues in the stalls in the winter and soundly beaten at Newcastle in February when last seen; however, the return to turf could help (provided the forecast fast ground isn't a problem) and she's on a handy mark on last season's best performances; not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2022-05-20 at Haydock (7f): "Inanna is a very nice filly. It was a nice fair track and we decided to send her up there because she had time to organiser herself. She could drop back, she is pretty versatile, but they didn't go much of a gallop. We like her at home and we will see how she comes out of the race. We have a nice bunch of horses, we have kept the numbers down, but hopefully the two-year-olds will be nice - Sean Woods, trainer."
