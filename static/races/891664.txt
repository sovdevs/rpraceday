🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First run after being ✂️ gelded when a closing third off this mark at Redcar (1m2f)
🔦 Spotlight: Only had seven races and went close in a 1m2f novice on fast ground; ✂️ gelded ahead of reappearance at Redcar (1m2f, good) where he finished a closing third; should be bang there off the same mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Will like the ground and still on a useful mark, but lacking a run perhaps not ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Chepstow (7f) and Windsor (1m, first-time cheekpieces) in September and it wasn't his first blip on soft ground when tailed off in his hat-trick bid; remains on a handy mark but lacking a recent run perhaps not ideal.
