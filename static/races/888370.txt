🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconsistent this season but was placed 16 days ago and remains on a good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Has a rather mixed record this season and is not sure to be suited by today's drop back in trip but kept on for third at Ayr (2m4f, soft) this month and remains on a good mark; rain will aid his cause; one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over hurdles/on the Flat since joining Brian Ellison in the autumn; arrested decline with close third in recent Catterick claimer (1m7f, good) but the value of that form is open to question and the forecast rain here is not in her favour.

💬 Comment: 0-6 over hurdles; not yet fully exposed but needs to learn to settle better
🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over hurdles and fortunate to inherit a modest third after some final-flight chaos on handicap debut at Sedgefield (2m1f, good) in November; not yet fully exposed in this sphere but needs to learn to settle better and the forecast rain is unlikely to help him on this first start for 117 days.

🔦 Spotlight: Fully exposed after 36 hurdle runs and probably won't be favoured by significant rain here, but won twice over today's trip in October (good to soft/good) and made the frame on final two outings in 2024 (2m3f/2m1f); each-way claims if still in similar form after 99-day break.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Comfortable winner on handicap debut but safely held since; tricky to predict
🔦 Spotlight: Big jolt of improvement to win comfortably on handicap debut at Ayr (2m, soft) in January but safely held off today's 12lb higher mark at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft) last month and is not an easy one to predict here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran okay on second of three stable starts but well beaten here since
🔦 Spotlight: High-mileage 9yo who had a modest hurdling strike-rate when trained in Ireland; bettered inauspicious stable debut when respectable fourth over C&D (good to soft) last month but was well beaten in mares' race here a fortnight ago and now has it all to prove again.
