🔦 Spotlight: 🔍 unexposed 4yo who won three of his four starts as a 3yo, notably a Southwell Class 2 handicap the final time (7f); surged clear in the final furlong on that occasion and although he's taking on smart opposition here, he looks well worth his place in the field.
Horse quote: 2024-05-02 at Redcar (7f): "I'm really happy with the way Paborus won there and he looks a fun horse for the future," he said. "I liked him a lot coming into this season and it's always exciting when these things work out. He's a lovely horse to have - Ed Bethell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Ended 2024 with some fine runs, including an Ascot win (7f); headgear absent on return
🔦 Spotlight: His career has been one of steady improvement and he enjoyed his finest hour when seeing off 17 rivals to win a valuable 7f handicap at Ascot last July (good to firm); ended 2024 with a solid second in Listed company at Redcar (7f, soft); has gone well fresh in the past but he's set to face competition for the lead and the cheekpieces he wore at the end of last season are discarded.
Horse quote: 2024-07-27 at Ascot (7f): "Northern Express has been a real good servant to everyone. Michael [Dods, trainer] and I discussed last week that he was probably getting a little bit cute in his old age, so we just popped the cheekpieces on today. He's run fourth in this race the last two years but it's typical of Michael, he's great with these sort of horses to keep them going year after year. It's massive to come down here and win - Paul Mulrennan, jockey."

💬 Comment: High-class 2yo; absent since the 2023 Dewhurst; returns at realistic level; check betting
🔦 Spotlight: Smart 2yo, winning a 6f novice at Newmarket and the Group 2 Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury (6f, heavy); absent since finishing down the field behind City Of Troy in the Dewhurst 546 days ago; 7f should be in range and this Lockinge entry needs monitoring in the market.
Horse quote: 2023-09-23 at Newbury (6f): "Array is super relaxed and has really improved from race to race. He got through that ground and hopefully he'll continue to go the right way. I just said to Andrew (Balding, trainer) that I'd love to try him over a little bit further - Oisin Murphy, jockey, talking to RacingTV"
