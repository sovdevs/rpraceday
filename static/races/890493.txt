💬 Comment: Flat winner (1m); minimal impact in three juvenile events (2m); set for handicap debut.
🔦 Spotlight: Won two on the Flat (1m) last year for David O'Meara; joined this trainer in October for 2,500gns and has made only minimal impact in three juvenile events (2m); isn't overburdened for the switch to handicapping off a two-month break for a trainer who won this in 2018 and 2023.
