🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D 0-72 scorer on Tuesday night's stable/Tapeta debut; player if over those exertions
🔦 Spotlight: Strongly backed ahead of his ultimately successful stable/Tapeta debut in a C&D 0-72 on Tuesday night, albeit he got up only close home; quick turnround after a hard enough race concerns more than a penalised mark which still compares favourably to his peak high-90s RPRs of yesteryear.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6lb swing (ignoring claims that day) with King Of York for almost 3l latest (C&D); chance
🔦 Spotlight: Twice lately mown down by well-treated rivals over this C&D, most recently King Of York, whom he reopposes on 6lb better terms (ignoring rider claims); still above any winning mark but place claims at the least.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10lb below last winning mark (C&D), but needs returning blinkers to provoke a revival
🔦 Spotlight: Now 10lb lower than for last September's C&D 0-72 success; blinkers of all three career wins are back on after cheekpieces failed to provoke significantly better, and hopes likely rest with these.
