💬 Comment: Won over C&D in December and not seen to best effect at Catterick last time; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Stayed on for fair third on handicap debut over 2m here (good) in November and won over this C&D (soft) next time; fair third of 16 at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in January and not seen to best effect at Catterick last time (3m1f, good to soft; made mistakes); could bounce back with bold show.

🔦 Spotlight: Following wind surgery he took a step back in the right direction when 11l second over 2m at Ayr this month; needs to build on that latest performance but it's possible the step back up in trip will be a plus.

💬 Comment: Twice runner-up for this 🆕 new yard but hasn't been at her best the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Won for Dan Skelton at Worcester last September and twice runner-up for this yard in November/January; however, she hasn't been at her best the last twice and a return to form is needed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up on handicap debut but has had a break since and showed promise previously
🔦 Spotlight: 16-1 when pulled up on handicap debut at Wetherby (2m3f, good to soft) in December and it's hard to be confident on the back of that, but the subsequent break may have helped and two starts ago he stayed on for a promising third in a novice at Carlisle (2m1f, soft); not written off.
