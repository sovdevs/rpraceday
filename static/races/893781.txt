🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won turf handicap last summer; flourished on AW since; solid chance back on grass
🔦 Spotlight: Successful handicap debut at Ripon (1m, good to soft) last June; has flourished on AW since and although not entirely convincing on turf since the win, she bumped into one at Beverley (about 1m, good) in April when possibly needing the run for 🆕 new yard (won this last year); solid claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sprang a massive surprise on AW (1m) on second handicap run; bred to do better yet
🔦 Spotlight: High-class Godolphin pedigree; fairly low key in early starts, including on turf handicap debut, but she picked up nicely to spring a massive surprise back on AW (1m) in April when miles out of the weights; 2lb higher off new mark but given her breeding she may well improve further.
Horse quote: 2025-04-18 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "We always knew Heavenly Heather was a really good horse. It was just getting her fit enough. She's such a big heavy mare she takes that much work getting fit. She's needed the race before and she's been green and backward. She's had loads of graft in the last month. I thought she would be sixth, if you took the first two out it's a basic Class 4 handicap. I knew there was improvement in her - Tracy Waggott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beverley form suggests she'll act well here; cheekpieces an unknown
🔦 Spotlight: Two turf wins, at 7f (good to soft) and about 1m (good to firm); unraced on this track but her Beverley form suggests she'll appreciate this similarly stiff one; first-time cheekpieces an unknown factor though.
Horse quote: 2024-08-31 at Beverley (8.5f): "Zapphire is not winning out of turn. She's not entirely straightforward but she has a decent level of ability. I popped her in a fillies' handicap in a fortnight at Leopardstown and that might be interesting. She loves soft ground so if it rained over there we'd be even happier - Steve Brown, trainer's husband and assistant."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Appreciated return to turf when cosy winner latest; more to do up in trip and grade
🔦 Spotlight: Had a good run of form on AW for this yard, winning over 7f at Southwell in March, but she seemed to appreciate the return to turf when coming home with purpose at Beverley (about 7f, good to firm) this month; not dismissed but has more on her plate over this longer trip in a higher grade.
