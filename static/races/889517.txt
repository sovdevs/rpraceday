💬 Comment: Made it 2-2 in a hood when completing a Newcastle double 18 days ago; 🔥 big player again
🔦 Spotlight: Back to form with a hood added when scoring at Newcastle (6f, Tapeta) last month and he defied a penalty with a brave success there seven days later; up another 3lb but he remains feasibly treated and is a 🔥 big player again.

🔦 Spotlight: Well backed when winning at Newcastle (5f) for Daragh Bourke in January, but he's been up and down since and was only eighth of nine here last time; should be fine on this step back up in trip but he's now 1-20 and others are more convincing; headgear back on.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: One win from 11 starts and has something to prove after six months off
🔦 Spotlight: Won over C&D for Jack Channon last July but she's not hit the same level since and was a fading seventh at Hamilton on stable debut in September; record now 1-11 and has something to prove after six months off.

💬 Comment: Ten-time AW winner who ran well over C&D latest and he could make a bold bid
🔦 Spotlight: Not easy to predict but he's a ten-time AW winner who scored at Chelmsford in January and was beaten less than 2l over C&D last Monday; usually races prominently and he's not ruled out.
