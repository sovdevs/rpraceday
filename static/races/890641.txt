🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Take seriously back over more suitable trip for handicap debut; cheekpieces go on
🔦 Spotlight: Showed much more than on his debut over 1m in January when making the frame in a C&D maiden before taking a backwards step over 9.4f; take seriously on handicap debut with cheekpieces fitted.

💬 Comment: Surely better than we saw on last month's handicap debut; Rossa Ryan rides again
🔦 Spotlight: Went backwards from a fair start last year; handicap debut off a 206-day break and following a gelding operation didn't go well but he was sent off just 5-1 and is presumably thought capable of much better; worth another go over 1m4f; hood goes on; Rossa Ryan rides again.
