🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sets the standard on last year's form, narrowly denied by Hotazhell in the Futurity
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to 1m6f Group 1 winner Grateful; never worse than second five starts at two; twice runner-up at this track, including in a four-runner 1m Group 2 before winning the 1m Group 3 Autumn Stakes at Newmarket; clear of the remainder when narrowly denied by Jessica Harrington's Hotazhell in the Futurity at Doncaster; handled soft then.

💬 Comment: Failed to boost Classic claims when fourth behind Wimbledon Hawkeye in the Royal Lodge
🔦 Spotlight: Second on debut at Killarney last July; odds-on when landing a Galway festival maiden on soft; failed to boost Classic claims when fourth of seven behind Wimbledon Hawkeye in the Royal Lodge; plenty of speed on the dam's side, but Camelot can supply the stamina required for this.

💬 Comment: Did not quite meet expectations when third in a 1m1f Group 3 event here last October
🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise (met trouble in running) in a 1m fillies' maiden at Cork on debut; made almost all at the same venue on second attempt, getting the better of a Ballydoyle-trained favourite and subsequent winner; did not quite meet expectations when third behind a long-priced stablemate in a 1m1f Group 3 event here in October.
