🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four wins this year and did well to win cosily here on Wednesday (6f); still on the up
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive sprinter this year, winning four times (including twice here over 6f); another step up the ladder when doing plenty wrong and overcoming some adversity in the run to win cosily here on Wednesday; still has more to come but the penalty and return to 5f make this tougher.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran well on her handicap debut at Southwell last month (6f) and another creditable effort when third in a Wolverhampton novice 16 days ago; a stiff 5f could prompt extra but it needs to.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a slowly-run two-runner C&D novice 12 days ago; this a much stiffer test of her merit
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on her first two starts before winning a two-runner C&D novice 12 days ago; that form unconvincing and she has much more on her plate now handicapping.
