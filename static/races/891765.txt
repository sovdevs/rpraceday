🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Career-best form when winning last month's Aintree Foxhunters'; upped in trip here
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish 9yo who posted career-best performance to win last month's Aintree Foxhunters' (2m5f, good to soft) on fourth start for current connections; has stamina to prove over new trip and may not be ideally suited by the faster ground but, nevertheless, needs to be taken very seriously.
Horse quote: 2025-04-03 at Aintree (21f): "We made the plan six months ago. My head girl Hannah [Roach] had a nasty accident on the gallops in November and I said to her then that I'd win this for you. The right horse won and the money was on. Once Gracchus De Balme went past me at the Grand National start I said to Hannah 'we've won this'. She had the best hunter chaser in the country, and he got a leg and she broke her back. We've got to do an Aldaniti and come back to win this next year with Iskandar Pecos - Joe O'Shea, trainer."

💬 Comment: 2-2 in points for this stable before very creditable fourth at the Festival here in March
🔦 Spotlight: Useful hurdler for Gordon Elliott a few years ago; returned from long absence with two good-ground point wins for new stable this year and stayed on for very creditable fourth over C&D (good to soft) at the Festival in March; good chance.
Horse quote: 2022-10-04 at Galway (19f): "Looking at Music Drive in the ring, I thought he looked a bit big and Jack (Kennedy, rider) said he'd come on a lot from it. We'll keep it small with him and he could step up in trip - Gordon Elliott, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won three-runner point in February but faces a tall order here
🔦 Spotlight: Fair hurdler/chaser in Ireland at his best and 1-4 in points for new stable this year, the win coming in three-runner open at Charing (good) in February; faces a fairly tall order here, though.
Horse quote: 2023-01-07 at Cork (20f): "Joy Of Life popped away well and when we jumped the last he put his head down and battled well. The first-time cheekpieces might have sharpened him up as well - J.J. Slevin, rider"
