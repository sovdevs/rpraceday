🔦 Spotlight: Career best when landing a beginners' at Downpatrick last month; too keen at Fairyhouse last week but looks well treated from his reduced hurdle mark back in handicap company and has to be high on the shortlist.

🔦 Spotlight: Looked 📈 progressive last year culminating in a handicap hurdle success at Cheltenham's November meeting; questions to answer now though having shown very little twice since; step back up in trip should help at least.
Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Cheltenham (21f): "All I wanted was for Hamsiyann to come back safe, it didn't matter whether he won or not. I was hoping he would avoid bad luck and have a bit of luck on his side. He was lucky that the horse who fell three out didn't bring him down. I gave a good bit of money for him a couple of years ago, but he's only coming to his milk now. That was sweet - Tony Martin, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won three of her last six; below form in a novice hurdle latest but can bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who got off the mark under rules with a maiden hurdle success at Wexford last summer; has continued to progress in handicaps, winning over C&D in October and bounced back from a lesser run back at this venue to land a 3m Leopardstown handicap hurdle last month; beaten favourite in a Wexford novice hurdle since but she's the type to bounce straight back.

💬 Comment: Took a step forward this season with 2 h'cap 2nds before maiden hurdle success latest
🔦 Spotlight: Took a step forward when switched to handicaps earlier this season, hitting the crossbar at Naas and Navan before landing a maiden hurdle at Tramore by a wide margin 17 days ago; that wasn't a strong race but she's 🔍 unexposed and clearly in form.
Horse quote: 2025-04-13 at Tramore (21.5f): "Fairyland Opera absolutely deserved it and she ran unbelievable races at Naas and Navan, bumping into two very good horses. It didn't do her handicap mark any good so we said we'd go back to a maiden. They either stay or they don't and handle Tramore or not but she did both just fine. She's gorgeous. The plan was always to step up in trip and she'll probably have one more run before her holidays - Lorna Fowler, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-11-07 at Newbury (24f): "It was a nice opportunity today. It was the first time over this trip, so we were going into the unknown a little bit, but we got a soft enough lead and American Sniper was able to save plenty - Jack Tudor, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Hit the crossbar in two maiden hurdles before getting off the mark at Fairyhouse in December; beaten 10l in the Fred Winter since and her mark may be stiff enough for now.

🔦 Spotlight: Encouraging return at Galway in October but disappointing over both hurdles and fences since; best form on softer ground than what is likely.
Horse quote: 2024-03-09 at Gowran Park (16f): "Whiskeywealth was very disappointing in the Dan Moore and I thought maybe I got it wrong and that he wasn't good enough but I'd say he was flat on the day. He did it well today and that's what I was hoping he would do all along. He was in great form coming here. He's been fairly consistent and we're delighted to get a big pot with him. He was due to run in this race last season and he scoped dirty a couple of days beforehand so it's lovely to pick it up 12 months later. He's still improving and that was probably a career best. This is a great prize."- Terence O'Brien, trainer."
