🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed from an easing mark on last three starts (twice in cheekpieces); similar prospects.
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win from 18 starts came over hurdles at Taunton this time last year; placed from an easing mark on last three starts (twice in cheekpieces) without threatening to play a more significant role; should handle soft ground, but others are more obvious for win purposes.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed from an easing mark on last three starts (twice in cheekpieces); similar prospects.
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win from 18 starts came over hurdles at Taunton this time last year; placed from an easing mark on last three starts (twice in cheekpieces) without threatening to play a more significant role; should handle soft ground, but others are more obvious for win purposes.
