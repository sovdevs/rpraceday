💬 Comment: Three course wins; positives to be taken from latest run at Chepstow (2m; in cheekpieces)
🔦 Spotlight: Three course wins, the most recent by a wide margin last October (2m, good to soft; off a similar mark); form had dipped this year, but there were positives to be taken from his latest effort when last of four finishers at Chepstow (2m; first-time cheekpieces); soft ground would suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent and pulled up in two of his last four starts, including over fences at Fakenham in January; fared okay, to a point, when sixth of eight over hurdles at Wincanton (2m4f, good) latest; handicapper cutting him some slack and a newly applied tongue-tie is noteworthy.
