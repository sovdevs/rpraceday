🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A leading player after a promising start for this stable here last month.
🔦 Spotlight: A five-race maiden in France but reached the frame over hurdles and fences; showed definite promise on first start for Gary and Josh Moore when finishing second to a potentially smart one over shorter here (soft) 22 days ago; goes back up in trip and, with nothing of that calibre in this line-up, he's the one they all have to beat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has displayed promise in Irish maiden hurdles and he's of interest on stable debut.
🔦 Spotlight: 3-9 in points; has struggled in handicaps off a mark of 105 in Ireland but not without promise in maiden hurdles (2m2f-2m6f) and showed best form when 10l third of nine at Fairyhouse (2m4f, soft) in January on final start for Ian Donoghue; has since changed hands for £8,000 and he's of interest on stable debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has a bit to prove but the return to maiden company on better ground could help.
🔦 Spotlight: A good-ground bumper winner who has yet to build on the promise shown in his novice hurdles (2m) since upped in distance and has been soundly beaten on both starts in handicaps this year; has something to prove at present but the return to maiden company on better ground could help.

🔦 Spotlight: Bettered his British bumper form when switched to hurdles in autumn 2023, finishing third in two deep-ground condition contests at Fontainebleau (2m2f); 125-1 for novice at Uttoxeter (2m4f) two days ago, in touch three out but soundly beaten when falling at the last; probably best watched after that.

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful in bumpers in 2022 but off 718 days before pulling up at Lingfield (2m3f, soft; 33-1) on hurdle debut last month; entitled to have improved for that and likely to make his mark over hurdles at some point given his bumper ability but probably best watched at present; tongue-tie added.

🔦 Spotlight: Bought for 8,000gns after finishing tailed off in a 1m6f maiden at Compiegne (favourite) in October on his only run for David Menuisier and pulled up on recent hurdle debut for this stable, in which he did plenty wrong; best watched at present.
