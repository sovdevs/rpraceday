🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form of latest C&D win strongly boosted and this 🔍 unexposed 6yo can go in again
🔦 Spotlight: Built on a promising comeback run at Wolverhampton when proving too strong for Old Harrovian (pair 2.75l clear of Arqoob in third) over 1m3f here seven weeks ago; the runner-up won comfortably off 3lb higher next time so this very lightly 6yo could still be well treated even after a 6lb rise, particularly as 1m4f could suit even better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form of C&D reappearance win boosted so might be worth forgiving Wolver defeat since
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo; just edged out by Plage De Havre on his C&D reappearance but promoted to first after suffering interference; that rival bolted up at Newcastle next time so a short-priced defeat for this one at Wolverhampton (1m6f) 11 days ago probably shouldn't be taken to suggest that the handicapper has got him.
