💬 Comment: All form on AW thus far; looked good at Wolverhampton latest; just 1lb higher back on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Looked an exciting prospect when winning twice in AW novice events at two/three; barely beat a rival in four handicap runs in 2024 but he showed his true colours with an emphatic win at Wolverhampton five weeks ago (6f), tanking through the race and finding plenty when asked for his effort; looked one to keep onside on that occasion but there is still a query about him proving as effective on turf; lenient mark on grass if he does, however.

🔦 Spotlight: Had looked thoroughly exposed when starting out for Ruth Carr last August but he ended the year with a series of good runs in sprint handicaps, including when suffering a torrid run through the closing stages at Newcastle when last seen in December; runs off the same mark and won't mind the conditions.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in four of his five AW runs since October but he's getting no respite from the handicapper as a consequence; should run his race but others look stronger for win purposes.
Horse quote: 2023-05-29 at Windsor (6f): "I really like Chief Mankato and always have. He's very professional and has a lovely character. I rate the stallion (Sioux Nation) and have had a lot of luck with him recently. Obviously, we'll think about Royal Ascot as this is probably the last week you can get a two-year-old out and run there. Why not go? - Charlie Hills, trainer."

💬 Comment: Showed bright speed when 3rd at Southwell on return to 6f last month; chance with a repeat
🔦 Spotlight: Fast-ground 6f win as a 2yo; last year's two wins came on AW but he was absent through midsummer; returned to 6f and he showed good speed when third of 11 in a useful event at Southwell four weeks ago; in the mix with a repeat.
Horse quote: 2024-12-04 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "Havanagreattime can be really strong when he has something taking him on but, when he relaxes in front and gets an easy lead, he's a different horse and he really quickened up well down that hill. We've always liked him and we thought he'd win a few more but hopefully next year he could turn out to be decent - Finley Marsh, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Won two 6f handicaps on AW last year; career best needed to take this on his return
🔦 Spotlight: Won his novice on turf (6f, good) but his two handicap wins last year came on Kempton's Polytrack; absent since flopping in the mud at Haydock last October; career best will be required to defy this mark back from 175 days off.
Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Kempton (AW) (6f): "Drama was a little bit disappointing on his last run and, as Tom Marquand said, he just felt as if he'd had a couple of runs in quick succession and lacked that kick. Either way, this was the obvious choice having won here before and the team at home have done a great job freshening him up. This was a great opportunity but I'd love to get him on a bit of soft ground now. He's run plenty of good races on the turf and I think he's pretty versatile - James Ferguson, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-10-06 at Ascot (6f): "It's great to get Rohaan back. I was under a bit of pressure today because I told his owners he was on his way back and they've come over from Ireland, so it's great. He's a horse of a lifetime for me and he'll come back here for the Group 1 on Champions Day. He finished fourth last year so we might as well have a go - David Evans, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-10-04 at Navan (6f): "When we bought Photosynthesis he was tiny, he looked like a little ball of a two-year-old but he just kept going through growth spurts. We gave him time and that patience has paid off. They think a lot of the runner-up so I'm delighted. If we still have him, there is a Listed race in Newbury in a month's time. He's not flash. He's so laid back and just keeps finding, so you probably wouldn't know where the bottom of him is - Chris Timmons, trainer"

💬 Comment: Group 3 winner at 2; struggled on last three starts; down in class but not a solid option
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice as a 2yo, including a Group 3 in the mud, but his losing run is up to ten and he has finished well down the field in his last three starts; those defeats have come in stronger races than this but 6f on drying ground may be an insufficient test.
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Newmarket (7f): "It wasn't the plan to make the running. Orne went last in, but he was first out. Normally he doesn't do a stroke when he is in front but I went on a fresh bit of ground, and he found a rhythm. Just towards the end he got a little bit lonely and ducked left, but he has done it well. It wasn't the plan to go on the far side as I wanted to drop in and get a lead and get there late. When I ended up in front I could see there was fresh ground there so I thought I might as well go there. He didn't stay the mile in the Autumn Stakes. He travelled good and he handled the ground, but he just didn't stay. He could get quicker this horse over the winter - Rab Havlin, jockey."
