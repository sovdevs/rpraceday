🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Both runs last month were very respectable and he continues to slip down the weights
🔦 Spotlight: Has not fired on all cylinders since last summer's 2m Uttoxeter win but comes here after two very respectable runs last month (2m4f/2m1f) and continues to slip down the weights; eased in grade and might be the answer.
Horse quote: 2023-09-06 at Hexham (16f): "I thought Allbetsoff was badly handicapped but he didn't look so there and will go up a bit for that. He did it well, he's grown with confidence and his jumping's got better. That was a good performance - Mark Walford, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Both runs last month were very respectable and he continues to slip down the weights
🔦 Spotlight: Has not fired on all cylinders since last summer's 2m Uttoxeter win but comes here after two very respectable runs last month (2m4f/2m1f) and continues to slip down the weights; eased in grade and might be the answer.
