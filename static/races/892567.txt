🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Locally trained, fell sole point, no impact in first bumper, ground a query, watch
🔦 Spotlight: Locally trained gelding held every chance when falling in sole point-to-point on heavy ground; no impact when 12-1 in first bumper at Navan (15.5f, soft to heavy) but may have needed that; his dam's best effort came on soft so the jury is out on whether this ground will suit; probably best watched.
