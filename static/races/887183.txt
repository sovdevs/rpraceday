🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not totally disgraced on reappearance but found the Welsh National (14-1) much too tough
🔦 Spotlight: Ended last season in excellent form on heavy ground in blinkers, winning twice over 3m1f at Wincanton before drawing 6l clear over an extended 3m6f at Exeter; not totally disgraced on reappearance but found the Welsh National much too tough at Christmas, despite starting 14-1; 5lb above his last winning mark but this is a big step back down in class.

🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten here on sole start on heavy (last term); won in December this season over the extended 3m2f at this track (soft) and Taunton (good to soft) and did it with seemingly lots to spare; that sharp improvement was followed by a disappointing show when favourite at Bangor but that was 3m6f and this race is a lot less competitive.
