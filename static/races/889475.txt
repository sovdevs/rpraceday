💬 Comment: Won with a bit to spare when upped to 3m at Southwell last month and commands respect here
🔦 Spotlight: Came good over fences at fifth attempt, when upped to 3m at Southwell (good to soft; second run in blinkers) last month; did that with a fair bit more in hand than winning margin might suggest and a subsequent 5lb rise is offset by Callum Pritchard's useful 5lb claim here; leading contender.

💬 Comment: Lurks on a good mark but all his best form was on soft or heavy ground
🔦 Spotlight: Only fifth of six in recent Newbury race won by The Boola Boss but was not beaten far and would almost certainly have been better suited by a stronger gallop; lurks on a good mark but all his best form was on soft or heavy ground, and he has never raced on anything quicker than good to soft.
