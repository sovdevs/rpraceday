🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Caught wide when 4th at Lingfield latest; second over C&D on penultimate run; back up 3lb
🔦 Spotlight: He has slipped in the weights and recent efforts haven't been without promise, including when sent off favourite for a 7f handicap at Lingfield two weeks ago; caught wide from still 11 there and still looked in form; on the downside, his new 3lb higher mark has now kicked in.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form this winter and he remains feasibly treated; should make another bold bid
🔦 Spotlight: He was returning from a 12-month absence when sixth at Southwell in December and he's improved run on run since, winning at Southwell in January (7f; Class 6) before a solid second back there last month; still feasibly weighted and he's one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Coaxed back to form by 🆕 new yard; Rossa Ryan booked for his return to Class 5; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Coaxed back to form by his new stable, winning at Lingfield in January (7f) and running respectably at Southwell twice since; back down in class today and Rossa Ryan booked; should go well.
Horse quote: 2025-01-03 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "If you look back at Secret Strength's old form he was the best horse in the race if he could find that again. People latched on to the jockey booking too, but I said to David [Allan, rider] he was in great order and was fit as I could've had him - Shaun Lycett, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running creditably in stronger 1m handicaps this year; one to consider ⬇️ dropped in class
🔦 Spotlight: Fair form as a 2yo, including a Newmarket novice win, but he hasn't stood a great deal of racing since; beaten under 3l in three 1m Class 4 handicaps this year and returning to 7f and dropping into a Class 5 will help; more appealing than many.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two C&D wins last year; promising return to action three weeks ago; handy mark; yard run 2
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to Jane Chapple-Hyam last August and she won two of her next three starts, both over C&D; the race didn't set up for her when fourth here three weeks ago, keeping on when the principals were out of sight; one of two runners for the stable.

🔦 Spotlight: Confirmed the promise of her Kempton debut third when filling the same spot over C&D in February; outpaced when dropped to 6f at Wolverhampton last month; may do better now handicapping but such progress will be needed to defy this mark.

💬 Comment: Promise in Ireland but he made a low-key stable debut at Kempton this month; sharper today
🔦 Spotlight: 7f turf winner in Ireland last September (also ran well at Dundalk); perhaps needed the run when well beaten at Kempton on this month's stable debut (7f; 25-1); still early days but others look safer.
Horse quote: 2024-09-30 at Down Royal (7f): "I thought Future Cutlet won well. I had to make him work in the last furlong to get there, and he'll probably get further in time - Billy Lee, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."
