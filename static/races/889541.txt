🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved for step up to 1m3f at Southwell when 2nd to good Godolphin prospect; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Has an Irish Oaks entry; stamina in the family and this one built on a fair 1m debut when runner-up to a good Godolphin prospect over 1m3f on this track, where she came home strongly despite showing inexperience; another step forward expected.

💬 Comment: Well backed for both 1m runs, got going too late at Kempton latest; 1m4f can suit
🔦 Spotlight: Well backed for both 1m starts, unable to fend off a promising newcomer of the Crisfords on this track and then she couldn't get going until too late at Kempton (odds-on) in January; however, she has plenty of staying power on the dam's side so has to be respected up in trip.

💬 Comment: Showed promise both 2yo starts, looking green each time; may well improve plenty
🔦 Spotlight: Signs of ability in novice events at Goodwood and Beverley (both about 1m) in the second half of 2024, looking green each time; has good connections and may well be a different proposition as 3yo; market can guide.

🔦 Spotlight: Nicely bred filly out of a well-connected mare; just mild promise in two bumpers but she came from off the pace, after being hampered and having to be switched, to take a pleasing third to 70s-rated rivals at Kempton (1m4f) recently; open to improvement and on the premises.
