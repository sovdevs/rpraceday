🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Held her own in a 3m Listed race at Doncaster and dropping in trip shouldn't bother her
🔦 Spotlight: Winning pointer and looks a winner waiting to happen under rules, last time holding her own in a 3m Listed race at Doncaster (good to soft); ran well over 2m4f the time before so this trip shouldn't be too big an issue; the one to beat.

💬 Comment: Long absences a feature in his profile; fair run last time and should have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Confined to just two runs since winning an Irish point in October 2021; returning from 841 days away when beaten 12l at Carlisle on rules debut and then off for another 378 days before beaten a similar distance there a month ago (2m3f, good to soft; just behind KI Woo); should have more to offer.
