🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chasing debutante and, although below par in her final hurdle race, a case can be made
🔦 Spotlight: Won back-to-back minor hurdle races on heavy ground and made a pleasing start in handicaps when beaten about 8l and 2l in her first two; latest start was a backward step but, if forgiven that, a case can be made on this chase debut.
