🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gained first chase win on latest, up 8lb and best form on testing ground, may need rain
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the sixth attempt over fences at Fairyhouse (2m5f, soft to heavy) last month; raised 8lb for that 1.25l win and drops back in distance but he has run well at around this trip over hurdles; all his best form is on testing ground so quicker conditions are a worry; probably needs rain.

🔦 Spotlight: Two-time hurdles winner is 0-6 over fences but has run well in defeat; beaten a neck at Clonmel (16.5f, soft) last month off 94; only up 1lb for that and this quicker ground is fine but he has run poorly in three previous starts going left-handed; others preferred.

💬 Comment: 1-6 over fences, best form is at 2m7f-3m1f, ground will suit but best watched after break
🔦 Spotlight: 1-6 over fences; touched off in a 3m handicap hurdle at Wexford when last seen in July; today's ground should be ideal for him but his best chase form is at 2m7f-3m1f; best watched after 240 days off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid run of form in November-December, failed to complete last twice, could bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: Was running well in November-December, placing over timber here and in a chase at Fairyhouse before winning over hurdles at Down Royal's Christmas meeting; held every chance when unseating off this mark in a chase at Leopardstown three days later; pulled up latest but could bounce back dropped in trip.
