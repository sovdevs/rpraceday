🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten only once under rules and has impressed in winning both his races over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: His only defeat under rules came at the hands of the smart Wingmen in a Punchestown bumper last spring and he gave that horse a race; odds-on for both his hurdle races and has won pretty much as he liked, last time breezing past the useful Captain Bellamy at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft); seems to have a high cruising speed; likeable.
Horse quote: 2025-03-21 at Newbury (20.5f): "The only horse that's beaten him is Wingmen, who has placed in a couple of Grade 1s and is rated 139. We're very lucky to have him. Queensbury Boy ran very well at Punchestown last year and while it's a big step up in grade, he has class and he's also fresh,. A lot of these talented horses have had tough winters, whereas Queensbury Boy hasn't. He's a novice until the autumn, so the Persian War will definitely be in our mind. I know one of Davids [Maxwell, owner-jockey] dreams is to win the Cheltenham hunter chase. It's a long time off, obviously, but hopefully he'll be that standard one day - Harry Derham, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Completed a six-timer last year in a Listed race but hasn't kicked on from there
🔦 Spotlight: Her win in a Listed novice hurdle at Galway (2m, good) last July brought up a six-timer but she's not kicked on from there and has been very disappointing the last twice; however, a tongue-tie joins regular cheekpieces and she has the form to feature.
Horse quote: 2024-07-30 at Galway (16.5f): "We had to step Gale Mahler up in grade to see what we had and she was very impressive. We can now go home and start making proper plans. She doesn't mind that ground, she'll handle slow ground but she wouldn't want winter-heavy ground. She is very straightforward and genuine. She is a very good mare and we can target some of the big races in the autumn and next spring - Adrian Keatley, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-3 over hurdles; solid second in a Grade 2 at Kelso and ready for this longer distance
🔦 Spotlight: Not overly pressed to win his first two hurdles at Downpatrick (good) and Wetherby (soft) before finishing second in a Grade 2 at Kelso (2m2f, good to soft); his finishing effort there suggests this longer trip can benefit and the third wasn't at all disgraced in a Grade 1 last week at Aintree.
Horse quote: 2025-01-23 at Wetherby (16f): "Chart Topper is a fantastic jumper, he's so measured. Once upon a time we thought he might be a Cheltenham horse. He got a setback and took a while to get the hang of it again but going jumping seems to have unlocked the potential we always thought he had.   As a bumper horse we thought he'd be a 140-plus horse, his first hurdles performance could have been that and that looks like it could have been that. He could go to the spring festivals but we'll probably keep him going in the summer and he could be a Galway and Listowel horse - Patrick Mullins, jockey."
