🔦 Spotlight: 🔍 unexposed 4yo who was in good form at Chelmsford when last seen, beaten a neck before winning there in February off 4lb lower than today; well beaten on her only go on turf but that came on soft ground on her debut; strong chance if translating her AW form to turf.

💬 Comment: Has been running respectably on the AW; disappointing favourite here yesterday
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped better than the bare result in cheekpieces at Southwell over 7f (denied a clear run) three starts back and ran to a similar level when back in blinkers at Wolverhampton next time; returns to 1m with no headgear for first time since 2023; last June's turf win came off 8lb higher; disappointing  favourite here on Friday.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All three wins have been on AW; below form the last twice; opposable.
🔦 Spotlight: Can front-run; record reads 3-50, with all three of those wins coming on AW; runner-up at Yarmouth over this trip early this month but he's been below that level in both starts since; looks opposable back on turf.

💬 Comment: 5lb below her sole win but needs to return to form in first-time blinkers.
🔦 Spotlight: 1-14, with her sole win coming off 5lb higher at Yarmouth (1m) last April; after two runs this term, she needs to return to form in first-time blinkers; visored (below form) once.
