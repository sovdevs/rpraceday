🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning run ended at the DRF, has to concede weight but has a chance on these terms
🔦 Spotlight: Came up short in his quest for a four-timer off a career high mark in a valuable 2m handicap at the DRF but still ran with great credit to finish fourth of 18; steps up markedly in trip returned to novice company and has to give weight to his rivals but entitled to be thereabouts with a rating of 139.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in point, won easily at Punchestown, bred for this trip, chance if handles ground
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in sole point-to-point for Pat Doyle; fell early on his Rules' debut in a Naas maiden hurdle but made amends by winning in fine style at Punchestown (2m3f, soft) a month ago; 🔍 unexposed, is bred to appreciate this longer trip and could go well if handling this better ground (both siblings won on good to soft).

💬 Comment: Maiden winner at Clonmel when jumping untidily, new trip and ground here, can't discount
🔦 Spotlight: Ran William Munny close in a heavy ground Naas bumper last year; won a Clonmel maiden (19.5f, yielding) despite jumping poorly in December; went close in a 2m novice here (soft) in January; reportedly jumped right and never travelled on latest; unproven on the ground and at this trip but can't be discounted for top yard.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper and maiden winner, struggled in a Naas Gr 1, could improve for better ground
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to Fayonagh won a bumper for Philip Fenton last April and a maiden hurdle on his first start for this yard in November, both on soft ground; came up short in a Grade 1 novice at Naas (2m4f, soft) when last seen in January; better ground might suit here and he isn't discounted back in these calmer waters.

🔦 Spotlight: Won back to back handicaps in May-June of last year; well beaten on return from a break in a Grade 3 novice here and then pulled up behind Ol Man Dingle at Leopardstown in December; off since and is probably watched for now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole mare in the field, gets weight from her rivals, proven on good ground, outrun odds
🔦 Spotlight: The sole mare in the field gets a nice bit of weight from the boys but she has a bit to find with a rating of 120; ran a nice race in a 2m4f listed mares' novice here last month, shaping as though further would suit; has run well on both previous starts on good-good to yielding; more needed to win but she could outrun her odds.
