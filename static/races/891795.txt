🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Showed good speed when second on her Kempton debut; going left-handed may help; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: February foal by Havana Gold; 9,000gns foal; 20,000gns yearling; sent off 3-1 and made much of the running when second of six (clear of the third) on her Kempton debut (5f, Polytrack) 12 days ago; hung left there, so going this way around should help and she could take some catching if again ridden positively from the inside stall.
