🔦 Spotlight: Third at Kempton with today's headgear combination in February (7f); has since been ✂️ gelded and given wind surgery; well beaten on first try at 1m at Wetherby on first run back (good to firm; ran without cheekpieces) but met plenty of trouble and is better than the bare form; interesting with cheekpieces back on.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten last two starts over 1m/1m2f last term; more needed on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Fair effort in a course maiden on debut last season (7f, good to soft) but well beaten next two starts (tried over 1m2f last time); needs to improve on handicap debut.
