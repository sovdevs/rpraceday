🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 at Redcar; shaped quite nicely at Pontefract on her return to action; down in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins last year, two of them at this venue; shaped better than the result on her Pontefract return 13 days ago, losing her position before halfway (hampered) but running on at the finish; drops in grade and should make a bold bid to retain her unbeaten course record.

💬 Comment: Chance on her AW best and shaped OK after break last time; first realistic chance on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Successful in a 6f handicap at Southwell in November but that hasn't been a springboard to better things; missed the break and then met trouble in running when ninth at Wolverhampton two weeks ago on her return from 100 days off; still to prove herself on turf but this her first realistic opportunity.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Expensive to follow but return to sprinting may help; not ruled out in a weak race
🔦 Spotlight: Well supported in his first three starts this year and placed in two of them; given a wind op after finishing third at Wolverhampton in January; didn't stay 1m at Yarmouth 16 days ago; becoming frustrating but could still have a bigger effort in him and this is weak; blinkers back on after one run in cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best run for some time when midfield at Doncaster last month; down in class; considered
🔦 Spotlight: Major player on her 2023 form but she went the wrong way last year; there was more encouragement in her midfield finish in a 0-72 handicap at Doncaster three weeks ago (5f, good), however, and she's considered back in these calmer waters.
Horse quote: 2023-04-02 at Doncaster (5f): "Little Muddy had been going well at home. I didn't think she'd be race-fit but she's done it well - Seb Spencer, trainer."

💬 Comment: More prolific on AW but ran okay back on turf last time and Tom Marquand a good booking
🔦 Spotlight: The bulk of his winning has been on AW but he is effective on turf and ran okay over 5f at Catterick 12 days ago; this isn't a strong race and he's not ruled out with Tom Marquand booked.
Horse quote: 2021-04-17 at Thirsk (6f): "Ustath has not shown anything on turf but he ran last week at Catterick over five and wasn't quick enough, so we said that we would put him on a flat track over six and let him bowl. He enjoyed it and dug deeply - Ben Sanderson, jockey."
