🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy hurdler here; fine 2nd at Warwick on second chase start; leading claims if he stays
🔦 Spotlight: Three hurdle wins here (2m, good; Grade 2/Listed) and, after a very tough task here on chase debut (well beaten when falling), he was a highly creditable second in a Grade 2 at Warwick (2m, soft) a fortnight ago; untested at today's trip but he stayed well on the Flat in France, and kept on strongly last time; top trainer has won this 13 times; leading claims if seeing it out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Grade 2 novice at Ascot on chase debut but perhaps lucky; well beaten in Grade 1 since
🔦 Spotlight: Highly talented hurdler (course winner) who won a Grade 2 novice on his chase debut at Ascot (2m3f, good to soft) in December, capitalising on the leader's final-fence blunder; made mistakes and faded when soundly beaten in heavy-ground 2m4f Grade 1 at Sandown three weeks ago; drops back down in grade today but needs to build on the Ascot form if he's to come out on top.
