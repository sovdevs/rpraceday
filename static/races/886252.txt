🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent maiden winner; handicapper asks a question but open to further progress
🔦 Spotlight: Still a work in progress as he raced freely last time and was green in front, but still had enough to justify favouritism in that 2m soft-ground maiden at Taunton; the handicapper has taken no risks with him but open to further progress.

🔦 Spotlight: Won with a bit to spare at Market Rasen and defied a 5lb rise at Hereford, though the runner-up (has run well since) would have got up in another stride; more needed here as he's up another 4lb and they claimed 7lb last time; still respected as a bang-in-form contender.
