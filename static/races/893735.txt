🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Prix Morny winner, second in Phoenix Stakes/Middle Park, handles an ease, can defy penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins from eight starts at two; out of the first three only twice, in top company both times, fourth of 13 in the Norfolk Stakes, and fifth of 12 behind Magnum Force in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Sprint; has a Group 1 penalty for his Prix Morny win, status as a top juvenile underlined by Phoenix Stakes/Middle Park seconds; handles an ease, should be hard to beat.
Horse quote: 2024-09-28 at Newmarket (6f): "Whistlejacket has run a decent race but Ryan [Moore, jockey] said he thought he could have done with a stronger pace. He was a bit slow out of the gates and took a lead whereas he likes things his own way - Aidan O'Brien, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needs to reverse Breeders' Cup form with Whistlejacket on ground that may not be ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 6f maiden at the Curragh on third start; backed that up with a front-running success in a weak 6f Group 3 at the same venue; missed the Middle Park on account of soft ground; ran on late when seventh in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Sprint; stablemate Whistlejacket is preferred on this ground and can uphold the form.
Horse quote: 2024-08-31 at Curragh (6f): "Ides Of March is powerful, fast horse. He finds it very easy to go quick. He travelled very easy through the race and he ran straight today. He looks like a Middle Park horse - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won 7f Group 3 at Deauville last August on good ground; fifth in the National Stakes; ended the season on a low note when last of nine in the Prix Jean-Luc Legardere; debut maiden win was achieved at the main expense of Whistlejacket over 6f in testing conditions over 6f at the Curragh; however, the Balllydoyle runner has a much stronger profile now.

💬 Comment: Good early-season juvenile last year, low-key reappearance in a 7f Group 3 at Leopardstown
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning debut in a 6f maiden at Naas last April; failed to confirm form with the runner-up Fairy Godmother (subsequent Albany Stakes winner) in a Group 3 over the same course and trip in May; did not appear again and made a low-key reappearance in a 7f Group 3 at Leopardstown.
Horse quote: 2024-04-29 at Naas (6f): "In her last couple of pieces of work Sparkling Sea is coming to hand. I'd say she's only going to get quicker with racing and I'd say you'll see a better filly on a nicer surface. She looks like a proper two-year-old, she's a good ball of a filly, and mentally she's very straightforward. Hopefully she can build on today and keep going forward - Colin Keane, jockey, speaking to Racing TV"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ended the season on a low note at Redcar, has been ✂️ gelded, stable's second string
🔦 Spotlight: Good effort when winning on debut over 5f at the Curragh (soft/heavy); close third in a 6f Group 3 on his second start; no impact in the Coventry or in a 7f Group 3 at Deauville, and ended the season on a low note at Redcar; has been ✂️ gelded; stable's second string.
Horse quote: 2024-04-21 at Curragh (5f): "I thought Midnight Strike was a nice colt but didn't expect him to win like that. He looks an Ascot-type horse and he's another nice Starspangledbanner for the owners [Teme Valley]. We thought he'd stay six but was certainly quick enough to start at five. He looks very smart - Joseph O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful sort, C&D maiden winner, takes a huge rise in class after 5f Cork rated victory
🔦 Spotlight: C&D maiden winner last October on third and final juvenile start, making all; first two starts at two were over 7f, but he started the new campaign with a win in a 5f rated race at Cork; takes a massive rise in class now.
Horse quote: 2025-04-06 at Cork (5f): "We'll see what the handicapper does with Bodhi Bear, there's a 3yo premier sprint handicap at Naas and another at the Curragh in June so maybe one of those. If he gets up too high in the handicap we may run him in one of those 3yo Listed races - Fozzy Stack, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."
