🔦 Spotlight: Came good at this time 12 months ago and he returned to winning ways in a 6f handicap at Wolverhampton last month; not beaten far in a steadily run race here last week, racing too freely and also caught wide from a double-figure stall; more appealing than many.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Regressive this winter and the step up to 7f isn't sure to arrest the slide
🔦 Spotlight: Early promise for this yard but he's been struggling for form this winter; tackles 7f for the first time; stable may have stronger claims with Straight A.
