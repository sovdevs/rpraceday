🔦 Spotlight: 100,000euros yearling; after having been ✂️ gelded and undergone wind surgery he could only manage fifth of 12 on stable debut at Wolverhampton (7f, AW) in February, but was sent off just 15-8; interesting to see if his backers return on handicap debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in six of her eight starts since handicapping; the last five were over 7f/1m on the AW, but she was third of nine on turf at Newbury (7f, good to firm) last summer; may not want too much rain but a major player otherwise.

🔦 Spotlight: All three starts in AW novices late last year, his best effort when fourth of 12 at Wolverhampton (7f) on his final outing (race has produced winners); makes his turf/handicap debut after four months off having been ✂️ gelded and well worth a 📊 market check.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third in a Newmarket seller last August, the form of which worked out well; watch market
🔦 Spotlight: Best of his three efforts last year when third of seven in a Newmarket seller (7f, good) on his final outing in August; not seen since, but the form of that race worked out really well and Tom Marquand an eyecatching booking; well worth monitoring in the market on handicap debut; stable also runs Havana Club.
