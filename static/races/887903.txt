🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won 2m3f bumper and landed hat-trick over timber on return; 4th since but 3m may suit
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 2m3f Limerick bumper on testing ground last term, following up at Tipperary before landing a hat-trick on hurdle bow at Fairyhouse on November's return, defying inexperience; that form has worked out okay and while he was a beaten favourite at Navan since, he might be ready for a step up in trip here; now tried with tongue-tie and hood for the first time.

💬 Comment: Won 2m3f bumper and landed hat-trick over timber on return; 4th since but 3m may suit
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 2m3f Limerick bumper on testing ground last term, following up at Tipperary before landing a hat-trick on hurdle bow at Fairyhouse on November's return, defying inexperience; that form has worked out okay and while he was a beaten favourite at Navan since, he might be ready for a step up in trip here; now tried with tongue-tie and hood for the first time.
