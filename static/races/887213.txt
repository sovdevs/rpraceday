🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd of five in useful event at Haydock (1m7f, good to soft) makes him the clear form pick
🔦 Spotlight: Minor honours in seven of his nine races, with fairly useful form on Flat; switched to hurdling when third at Wincanton (good) in October and second of five in useful event at Haydock (1m7f, good to soft) 13 days ago, both of which make him the form pick in this field; particularly the latter and that's despite jumping mistakes; the one to beat.
