üî¶ Spotlight: Handed three Grade 1 juvenile assignments last February-May, with declining returns (seventh in Triumph here); second of five to Beckett Rock at Clonmel (2m1f, soft; bad mistake three out) in January was much more like it and that was his first run for eight months; with this new trip making appeal on this handicap debut, he's one to take seriously.

üî¶ Spotlight: Won debut and placed all five races since; the last three were warm handicaps, notably the Greatwood here (2m, good) penultimate start, in which he came from off pace to go down by half a length; off 81 days; youngster who's back up markedly in trip and brings potential for trainer with a fine record in Festival handicap hurdles, including winning the last two renewals of this one.

üí¨ Comment: Good record here, top weight when second from the rear in this last year; 4lb higher today
üî¶ Spotlight: Top weight when second from the rear in this last year, following fifth in the County at this meeting in 2022 and 2023; won a small-field conditions event at Christmas on sole start this term; brings a proud record but without that many wins and he's probably vulnerable off 4lb higher than last year.

üí¨ Comment: Some notable big-field results, notably over fences; not handicapped so well in Britain
üî¶ Spotlight: Fourth in the Grand Annual here last March; that's over fences, in which sphere he's registered easily his best efforts, notably his clearcut win in a 19-runner Listed handicap at Navan (2m4f, soft) on penultimate start; something amiss at Christmas on latest; has a vastly lower hurdles mark in Ireland (second in a big field in November) but the British handicapper hasn't been nearly so generous.

üî¶ Spotlight: Usually claimer ridden but now has Harry Cobden; the last of her ten wins was in August 2022; still shows plenty on occasions, including when seventh in the Pertemps Final last March and a close second back at Cheltenham (2m4f, good) three starts back; pulled up with cheekpieces enlisted on latest start; that headgear is now discarded but she's not the percentage call.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Smooth win in 17-runner race at Sandown (2m4f, good) last April sparks major interest
üî¶ Spotlight: Fell in his second chase; back hurdling for his three starts since, all over about 3m and he's not proven over that far but latest was a step back in the right direction (travelled best); this appears more his trip and a look at his smooth win by nearly 7l in 17-runner handicap at Sandown (2m4f, good; 7lb higher today) last April sparks major interest.
