💬 Comment: Latest race probably took little winning but clearly a contender in his current form
🔦 Spotlight: Seeks a hat-trick but he only beat two rivals at Catterick 12 days ago (2m3f, good to soft) and the odds-on favourite never turned up; likely to need more here off 6lb higher but clearly a contender.
