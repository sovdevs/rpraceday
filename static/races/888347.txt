🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Front-running tactics on last three starts resulted in career-best form, twice over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to front-running tactics last three starts and it resulted in career-best form, winning over C&D (good to soft) in December before bold shows in two valuable handicaps, the latest off this mark back over C&D (soft); his notable good-ground form was in 2023 but he needs major respect.

💬 Comment: All wins on good ground, in three-runner race on latest start but he threw in a blunder
🔦 Spotlight: Won last May/June (2m/2m4f, good) in the first two of his five runs over fences, but it took a three-runner race for him to score again three weeks ago (Doncaster 2m, good) and he still threw in a blunder even then; in this company, others are a bit more persuasive.

🔦 Spotlight: Launched chasing career with three good runs last season but fell next time and suffered heavy defeats in his three starts since; this should be a good mark but plenty now seems to depend on January's wind surgery.

🔦 Spotlight: Three handicap wins over about this trip as a novice chaser last season, the last of which was on good ground; continued to look pretty solid this term until valuable C&D race last time but a bad mistake at the ninth may have scuppered his chance; could bounce back.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won his first four over fences but two lesser shows since; trainer has good record in this
🔦 Spotlight: Bossed lesser opposition on first four starts over fences (2m-2m1f; good or good to firm) last May-July; early mistake seemed to dent his confidence next time (pulled up) and well beaten in valuable event at Ascot (2m1f, good) in November on his only start since; won a novice hurdle over 2m3f but whether this step back up in trip will suit is unclear; trainer has good record in this race.
