🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dark horse reappearing at 2m but his family and style of Newcastle 2m AW win give hope
🔦 Spotlight: Won here as 2yo; opened his 2024 campaign in the Derby and a Royal Ascot handicap, before sights were lowered when justifying favouritism in a Racing League handicap at Newcastle (1m4f, Tapeta; 4lb higher today) in August; heavy defeats in major 1m4f turf handicaps on his two subsequent starts, since which he's been ✂️ gelded and had wind surgery; dark horse reappearing at 2m but his family and style of the Newcastle win give significant hope.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Just two runs in more than three years with this yard but they were career bests in 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Eight races overall and only two in more than three years with current yard, when making all over C&D in March 2023 and going close in the Northumberland Plate (2lb lower today) that July; the first of those came after 638 days off and this time he's had 637, with his trainer's five wins this year including two at 66-1, so it may well be dangerous to write this 8yo off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive on Tapeta (unraced on Polytrack) before two encouraging 1m6f runs on turf
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive on Tapeta (unraced on Polytrack) before winning by a wide margin at Chester (1m6f, heavy) last September; ran creditably off this 12lb higher mark at York in October, which was good enough for only fifth of seven but he seemed caught out by a steadily run race and showed promise for this longer trip; better looks highly likely moving into just his second season.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 8yo; creditable fifth in this race last year after another winter break; 5lb lower today
🔦 Spotlight: Can front-run; infrequent winner nowadays, last scoring in a four-runner chase in November 2023; ran badly over C&D in December on latest Flat start but runner-up here the previous month and he was a creditable fifth in this race last year after another winter break; 5lb lower today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some positives but peak AW efforts are at Lingfield and he's never raced beyond 1m4f
🔦 Spotlight: In good form this time last year, won under Jack Dace last September and has a run under his belt for 2025; however, peak AW efforts have been at Lingfield rather than Kempton and never having raced beyond 1m4f means that plenty of guesswork is required for this 2m race.
