🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed on all four starts since joining this yard, not 📈 progressive but clear chance here
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in both hurdle starts in France; placed on all four starts since joining this yard, though no sign of improvement since second to the useful Goraibhmaithagat over 2m here in December; trip-versatile, second over 3m at Cork and same placing over an extended 2m2f at Naas; should not be far away.

💬 Comment: Leopardstown third was the subject of an inquiry, this race appears to have greater depth
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point and bumper winner; two disappointing runs over hurdles with tongue-tie which was left off for his most recent run when sent off favourite at Leopardstown; ran on from off the pace to take third, prompting the stewards to ask questions, explanations were noted; this race appears to have greater depth.
