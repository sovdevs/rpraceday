🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not seen since disappointing run in January but earlier form gives him strong claims
🔦 Spotlight: Scored at Ayr (2m3f, good to soft) on seasonal debut in October and made the frame over 3m on his next three outings (good to soft-soft); not seen since disappointing run in January and not sure to be ideally suited by today's faster ground, but has a good chance if back on song.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over hurdles but kept on for respectable fourth when upped to 2m7f for last spring's handicap debut at Uttoxeter (good to soft) and probably needed her reappearance run here (2m4f) four weeks ago; may still have a bigger performance in her.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has not progressed since last summer's win but ran well in recent 2m7f Hexham handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to progress from last summer's winning hurdle debut at Hexham (2m4f, good), but ran well when fourth of 15 in 2m7f handicap there (good to soft) this month and can play a big role here if aided by new cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish veteran mare who came good for Nick Alexander at second attempt, under Natasha Cookson at Hexham (2m7f, soft) last spring; needs to leave last month's poor effort behind but her reappearance run in January was very encouraging and she's effectively only 1lb above her winning mark.
