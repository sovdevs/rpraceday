🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't won since his debut (AW in 2023); ✂️ gelded in March and close second of 14 at Newbury (1m2f, good; 3lb higher today) two weeks ago was easily his best turf result, putting him back on the right tracks.

💬 Comment: Off since tailed off last July; wind surgery in November; could still have potential
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to the very classy Subjectivist and Sir Ron Priestley, suggesting stamina tests; made all for the breakthrough in a five-runner handicap at Carlisle (1m3f, good) last July but tailed off when favourite at Ascot (1m4f, good to firm) 15 days later; not seen since and had wind surgery in November; could still have potential.

💬 Comment: Player again last time but there's a question over whether good ground is any longer ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins at about 1m in a productive spell on good to soft/soft last summer and he was a close third of 18 when returned to turf at Doncaster (1m2f, good to soft) four weeks ago; player on that but there is a question over whether good ground is any longer ideal.
Horse quote: 2024-07-09 at Pontefract (8f): "Distinction has done us proud. The stiff mile and soft ground were ideal. He's declared for Kempton tomorrow but that was just a back-up in case he couldn't run here - John Mackie, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Made all in novice at Epsom (good) last April and better form in some of his handicaps afterwards; not seen since a lesser show on heavy ground in September; stays 1m3f; good shout on best form.
Horse quote: 2024-04-23 at Epsom (8.5f): "Into Battle is such a good-looking horse and his work has been decent, but I wasn't expecting that. I expect the handicapper will take a dim view, but I'm sure there's plenty more to come - Ed Walker, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-10-25 at Newmarket (10f): "High Point ran a nice race at Windsor last time and we were quite confident coming in as he is a galloping type. He could get a mile and three quarters next year - George Downing, rider."

💬 Comment: Out of form over hurdles and last of nine on recent return to Flat (33-1)
🔦 Spotlight: Out of form over hurdles last year and this, with last of nine on recent return to Flat (33-1); down the weights but best watched at present.
Horse quote: 2023-01-13 at Huntingdon (16f): "Perseus Way is a very nice horse and I'm pleased that he has done it well today. His jumping is getting better all the time, but it needs to. He is getting slicker and quicker and he is starting to enjoy his racing. It was a good run in defeat at Chepstow last time and I felt that Chepstow was probably soft enough for him. We rode him too far back that day and that is why we rode him handier today. I don't think he is good enough to run in the Triumph but I think he could have a strong chance in the handicap - Gary Moore, trainer."
