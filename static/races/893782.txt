💬 Comment: 📈 progressive at 7f and 6f; up another 3lb for Musselburgh win; may improve further
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive at 7f and 6f since cheekpieces fitted, beating a good yardstick at Ayr in October (6f, good) and reappearing with another improved show to win at Musselburgh (7f, good) in April; up a further 3lb but may still be ahead of the handicapper.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three 6f handicap wins in 2024 but below best this year and now in first-time headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Three 6f handicap wins in 2024 (all on good to firm), the latest at Thirsk off this mark, but he has to prove suited by a stiff track and fitting blinkers is the response to two below-par runs this year.
Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Thirsk (6f): "I thought Kings Merchant would have been an unlucky loser. He usually does just enough to win and I told Callum not to get to the front too soon, but he's given him a great ride, he was incredibly patient. He travelled all over them and is a really progressive horse. He's only been out of the first three once this year, which is brilliant. He's great fun - Ed Bethell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest win over C&D last July; well treated but struggled for a while; blinkers refitted
🔦 Spotlight: On a decent mark on the pick of her 2024 form when adding two more wins, most recently when narrowly seeing off May Blossom over C&D (good to soft) last July; she's struggled a bit since, thus the favourable mark, but the return to 6f will suit and regular blinkers are refitted.
Horse quote: 2023-09-24 at Hamilton (6f): "Iris Dancer goes halfway through the race then jacks in a little then she warms back up and you always know you'll get a run out of her in the end. She really enjoys that stiff finish, she gets into top flight just at the line. It'd be nice to find another race before the end of the year and see what we can do - Andrew Mullen, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below best since Pontefract win (6f) in August but just 1lb higher; likely type
🔦 Spotlight: Form retreated at the end of 2024 and she never showed on her Doncaster return but this track will suit better and she's only 1lb higher than when her stamina came into play on the stiff finish at Pontefract (6f, good to firm) in August; potential reviver.
