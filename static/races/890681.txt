🔦 Spotlight: Solid operator who completed a useful C&D double in January, beating several of these rivals and taking AW record to 3-6 (he's 3-4 at Newcastle); commands respect with further progress plausible.
Horse quote: 2025-01-01 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "Storm Star is a strong traveller, but he tends to hit a flat spot mid-race, whereas today he just took me into it without me feeling like I was ever going to get beaten on him - I struggled to pull him up as well! Once he's in this form, I don't think the track makes a difference, he'd have won wherever to be honest. It's nice to have a winner for Andrew [Balding, trainer] and Mr Smith [owner] - Hayley Turner, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-10-04 at Dundalk (AW) (5f): "The drop in class has probably done Valiant Force's confidence the world of good more than anything. I kind of kidded him along rather than being aggressive because he hasn't really been finishing his races. He disappointed on dirt in the States early this year but hopefully he's getting back on track now - David Egan, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Met trouble in the Lincoln last time; ran creditably in races won by Storm Star and Destructive otherwise this year, and finished third off 2lb higher in this event 12 months ago; each-way hopes.
Horse quote: 2023-11-15 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "It's always a bit worrying when you've let one go. You're hoping that you'll keep tabs with him but I think we went a decent gallop in our pack in trying to not let the leader get too far away. It's played out and worked in our favour. Fantastic Fox won quite cosily in the end - Aidan Keeley, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Produced a strike-rate of 3-5 switched to AW this winter and the form is solid; came up short in the Lincoln most recently but could have more to offer back in this sphere; has won over C&D.
Horse quote: 2025-02-14 at Southwell (AW) (7f): "We've always liked Apiarist and he's thriving. He's picked up a couple of nice prizes and he's progressive. He's maturing with every run and the drop back to seven furlongs today suited him as he's raced keenly in the past. I thought Rab Havlin gave him a fantastic ride. He settled nicely and he has the stamina to stay out this trip. I think he won nicely in the end. This opens up options moving forward for him. The Lincoln could be the starting place for his turf season and those big handicaps are run at a good gallop, so they should suit him - Adam Ryan, trainer's assistant."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has done his winning over 6f/7f; something to prove back over 1m
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 6-13 on AW but gained the wins over 6f/7f; disappointing favourite last time when bidding for a Newcastle double and has something to prove back at 1m (second attempt).
Horse quote: 2024-01-31 at Kempton (AW) (7f): "It looked as though there'd be a good bit of pace on and it worked out that way. Going back up to 7f at a track he's won at before probably all helped but I think Brewing is a horse who is really learning how to drop into gear now, he's been winning but has still looking a bit immature about it but tonight he was direct and true. It was a good performance - Tom Marquand, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Irish gelding who is 2-3 in Dundalk contests this year and beat Final Voyage over 1m most recently, belying 20-1 odds; stiffer assignment in this field and has never defied a mark this high.
Horse quote: 2025-01-17 at Dundalk (AW) (7f): "Exquisite Acclaim travelled everywhere, was half-idling with me up the straight and I brought him over towards the rail. Once he did that he ran through the line well - Jamie Powell, jockey."
