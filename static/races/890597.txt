🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stayed on for close 2nd in 2m7f maiden, then won over 2m4f; handicap debutant; improve
🔦 Spotlight: Not an obvious stayer on pedigree but he kept on well when losing out late in 2m7f maiden at Worcester (good) in September before getting off the mark at Market Rasen (2m4f, good to soft; narrowly) last month; acts on soft; potential 🚀 improver now handicapping.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won on soft; best form for recent wins at 2m7f (good to firm) and 3m2f (good)
🔦 Spotlight: Has won on soft but two recent wins, at Exeter (2m7f) and here (3m2f), have been on good to firm and good, the latest when too good for one on a hat-trick; he won well enough there to think he can manage a 7lb rise but the switch back to soft ground gives pause.
Horse quote: 2024-05-29 at Newton Abbot (21f): "He was always very immature, very green so Coconut Twist went down to Chris Barber's and won a point-to-point. He came back from that a mess and so it's taken until now to get him back right. Harry (Reed)'s done a lot with him at home - Daisy Hitchins, trainer, speaking to Sky Racing."

💬 Comment: Suited by soft ground; below best on good latest but has his conditions again
🔦 Spotlight: Suited by soft, as for 2m4f maiden win at Southwell last March and when staying on well to be a close second at Chepstow (2m7f) in February; failed to reproduce it on good ground since but these conditions are more up his street; yard also runs Kruger Park.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Quiet until back to form in first-time blinkers (3m2f, soft); needs blinkers to work again
🔦 Spotlight: He hasn't had masses of racing in the last four years and was rather quiet back from the latest layoff until successful in first-time blinkers at Warwick (3m2f, soft) in February; a 4lb rise shouldn't be a problem on past form but the blinkers need to work a second time.
Horse quote: 2024-02-08 at Huntingdon (25f): "Barricane lost so much ground at the start and was so far behind that I'd given up on the second circuit and started looking at tomorrow's racing on my phone. Then at the cross flight I though he might be fourth and he just came from nowhere at the last. It has to be one of the rides of the season to win and this is the second time that Lewis has won on the horse - Olly Murphy, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not up to big rise in weights for 2m4f win last March; pulled up latest; trip query
🔦 Spotlight: Took a hiding at the weights for Newbury win (2m4f, heavy) last March; he's run to a similar level in defeat twice since but was pulled up at Fontwell in February and 3m2f may be further than he wants to go.
Horse quote: 2024-03-01 at Newbury (20.5f): "The ground didn't worry Kruger Park much as he's a Kapgarde who stays forever. He's beginning to learn at long last. He'll be a chaser next season and a lovely one, but he's taken a long time to come right. He ran off the course at Taunton last season and has been a real baby, but today is the best he's behaved and he travelled and jumped well, while Freddie gave him a super ride. He wasn't easy to break in and is a typical Kapgarde - they take forever. He was a boy and wasn't straightforward last year, but he's got there now - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Acts on soft; creditable first 3m run latest; needs more for this greater test
🔦 Spotlight: Acts well on soft; formerly useful at up to about 2m5f but it's been a long road back and although he seemed to stay the new 3m trip at Southwell (good) last month, this greater test asks for more.
Horse quote: 2021-02-23 at Taunton (16.5f): "I didn't know what to expect from Rockadenn as he ran out the other week. He had a wind op just before Christmas as he couldn't breathe at all. We didn't know what to expect as he jumped free and ran off the other day. He's a bit of a lad but he's clearly got ability to do that. I'm really surprised by it and I thought the other horse would get tired. He's not entered at Cheltenham but there's a nice handicap we might go to on Midlands National day and something like that could be realistic. He could mix and match chasing too - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart in his prime but in poor form over fences; first hurdle run for 3 years
🔦 Spotlight: Smart hurdler and useful chaser in his prime but on a losing wicket over fences for a long time; perhaps he'll be all the better for a return to hurdles, for the first time in three years, but that's up in the air.
Horse quote: 2021-02-06 at Musselburgh (15.5f): "Christopher Wood was good because you wondered turning in whether the runner-up had gotten away from him. This place suits him well as he travels nicely and is a slick jumper. He seems to like this type of ground and for a handicapper he's quite consistent. We'll go now for the Morebattle at Kelso on March 6 - Harry Derham, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest win over 2m7f last February; down weights but still having a slow season
🔦 Spotlight: Suited by Exeter and the most recent of four wins there came over 2m7f on heavy last February; he wasn't too far away there in November but hasn't looked like adding to his tally since, the last twice in blinkers.
Horse quote: 2021-02-26 at Exeter (18.5f): "Striking A Pose is rated 130 so he was supposed to win like that. He's a nice chap and a gorgeous-looking horse and it was nice to watch all the way round - his ears were pricked and he didn't put a foot wrong. I think 2m4f is perfect, he's got a bit of class about him so he's not short of speed. I'm sure he'll end up over 3m but this trip is fine on genuine soft ground. I don't think we'll step him up to three this season. We've got some options now, he's qualified for the EBF Final at Sandown in a couple of weeks. He's probably not an Albert Bartlett horse but he might be competitive at Sandown, or he could go to Aintree. I expect we'll lean to Sandown. He'll be a lovely chaser for next season - Joe Tizzard, assistant to trainer Colin Tizzard."
