🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-9, up 3lb for Navan win over 6f on final run of 2024, unproven on testing ground
🔦 Spotlight: 2-9 and won on her final start of 2024 at Navan (6f, good to yielding) off 72; up 3lb for that, which seems fair but she has to prove she acts on testing ground (well beaten sole start on yielding).

💬 Comment: Has improved for h'caps, fine run on heavy at Galway on last start, trip a query
🔦 Spotlight: Not much impact in maidens at 5f-6f but improved markedly in handicaps; finished close up in third behind Gazelle D'Or at Navan (6f) off 67 and was beaten 1.5l on heavy at Galway off 66; will handle the ground here but the drop to 5f raises questions.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise in a pair of Navan maidens at 5f, slowly away on h'cap debut on AW, best watched
🔦 Spotlight: Has shown promise in two 5f Navan maidens and it wasn't a terrible effort on debut over this C&D on debut, all those runs coming on good ground; disappointed on her AW and handicap debut at Dundalk in October; off since and may be best watched tackling testing ground for the first time.

🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard and preferred by Wesley Joyce; didn't show much in five starts last year at 6f-1m all on good or quicker ground; unraced on softer but his brother won on heavy ground at this trip and that offers hope for improvement; interesting.
