üî¶ Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; also favourite for handicap hurdles at Newbury (2m) and Exeter (2m7f) on his two starts since, coming up short but there has been some renewed promise from off the pace; wears headgear first time and he's been the ante-post favourite.

üí¨ Comment: Good 3rd of 20 at Leopardstown (2m7f, yielding) latest; respected stable won this in 2021
üî¶ Spotlight: 4-11, all over hurdles; good third of 20 at Leopardstown (2m7f, yielding) at Christmas when last seen, where she raced a bit freely and did not see it out after leading approaching the final flight; there's a bit to prove at this new trip, therefore, but she's not discounted for a respected stable which had a comfortable win in this race in 2021 with a mare at very similar stage of her career.

üî¶ Spotlight: Took a Grade 2 novice (soft) in 2022 and stormed home well clear when upped to an extended 2m7f for a handicap back at Sandown (heavy) in December this term; found a promising one much too good over that same C&D (heavy) last time but beat the rest; second in a novice on good going in 2023 but today's likely move away from the mud asks the question.

üí¨ Comment: Never better than when last seen (November) but he is also on a career-high mark
üî¶ Spotlight: Placed on his only two runs at Cheltenham, latterly when second over C&D (good) last April; Aintree qualifier (3m, good) after five months off saw him end a two-year losing spell; followed that with a close second to Supreme Gift at Market Rasen later in November, so he's never been better but he is also on a career-high mark which requires further improvement.

üî¶ Spotlight: Well beaten when refusing in November but followed that with a tidy win at Kelso (extended 2m6f, good to soft) in December; last three of his four wins have been at that track; good, staying-on fourth in the Musselburgh qualifier (3m, good to soft) latest outing and may have something more in the tank.
