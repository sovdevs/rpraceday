🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in last year's Martin Pipe, first chase start showed promise, might need further
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins over hurdles; runner-up in the Martin Pipe at Cheltenham in March; satisfactory first effort over fences on return when chasing home the smart Ile Atlantique over an extended 2m4f at Navan; dropped away in the straight in Grade 1 contest at Limerick; trip may be shorter than ideal.

🔦 Spotlight: Beat subsequent Grade 2 winner Touch Me Not in a beginners' event here in October; jumping difficulties have seriously interrupted his progress in two runs at this venue and when 4-1 second favourite for a valuable Leopardstown handicap; risky proposition but interesting that his in-form trainer gives him this opportunity to get his campaign back on track.
