🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gifted an easy lead at Ayr and made the most of it; this might not pan out so favourably
🔦 Spotlight: Stays further but he went from the front back over 2m at Ayr ten days ago and was never headed, coming home 37l clear having been left in isolation late on; would have won anyway and it's hard to grumble with the 5lb rise; whether this will pan out quite so favourably looks highly questionable.
Horse quote: 2025-04-11 at Ayr (16.5f): "The race never really materialised and I'll have a think about whether to run Asta La Pasta tomorrow - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all in Aintree's Red Rum and sure to try something similar; up 9lb but they claim 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Smacks of a spring horse and recently won Aintree's Red Rum Chase (2m, good to soft) for the second successive season under a superb front-running ride from Harry Cobden; handicapper came down hard with a 9lb rise but Jay Tidball claims 5lb and this 7yo will take some reeling in if in similar form.
Horse quote: 2025-04-03 at Aintree (16f): "Sans Bruit ran very well on good ground earlier in the season, but in the winter he hated that heavy ground. When he ran at Windsor, Cobby [Harry Cobden, jockey] said, 'we'll just get him right in the spring and he'll take all the beating in this race', and that's what we've done. He managed to run off with Freddie [Gingell] the other day at Chepstow, but the biggest thing is that he looks amazing now, this is his time of year, he's come in his coat in his sunshine, he's relaxed and we had him really, really right - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Front-runner and solid efforts in beginners' chases; 🔥 big player if avoiding mistakes
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful hurdler who has come up short in four beginners' chases in Ireland but it's all strong form and late errors cost him dear when he succumbed at the death to a respected rival at Wexford (2m, yielding) last time; will need his wits about him to avoid mistakes around here and competition for the lead is assured; still respected as a Mullins raider making his handicap debut in this sphere.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy customer who made a bad mistake two out in a handicap at Cheltenham last time
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2 novice winner last season; tongue tied this campaign and, after winning the Haldon Gold Cup on reappearance, he ran respectably in the Grade 1 Tingle Creek and Grade 2 Game Spirit; looked interesting back in handicap company at Cheltenham (2m) but a bad mistake two out put paid to his chance; highly respected.
Horse quote: 2024-11-08 at Exeter (17.5f): "JPR One is a really good horse. He is my future and he could go right to the top, but I won't run him lots of times. The second half of last season he never really got his ground - it was as simple as that. He will have an entry in the Tingle Creek. Today was what we were thinking about though. He has won over two and a half miles over hurdles, but I don't think we need to think about that just yet - Joe Tizzard, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best known for hurdling exploits; hasn't been seen over fences since late 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 1-5 over fences but last seen in this discipline pulling up at Cheltenham in late 2023; has since gone 1-10 over hurdles, the win coming at Ascot earlier in November off 1lb lower (1m7f, good); encouraging run last time but he returns to fences in a hot contest.
Horse quote: 2024-11-22 at Ascot (15.5f): "They went off like the clappers to start off with and I was the first off the bridle. Aucunrisque always puts in a good race and he's a good, tough horse - Freddie Gordon, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lost little in defeat when the hat-trick bid came up shy at Newbury; can run well again
🔦 Spotlight: Only his second run over fences when winning easily at Huntingdon (2m, good to soft) and he followed up at Kempton (2m2f, good) when left clear late on; no match for the winner when running off this mark at Newbury last time but he was conceding plenty of weight and some scruffy jumping didn't help; off a low weight he's by no means dismissed.
Horse quote: 2025-03-15 at Kempton (18f): "If I'd gotten any more detached I probably would have given up hope too, but I was never that far back that I was going to have to pull up. Teddy Blue stayed and once he turned for home he knew the stables were ahead, and he duly took off. I think the hardest part was getting on him and getting him down to the start. He takes a bit of knowing and Harry and Paul O'Brien told me all about him, so it's a lot of thanks to them for the help - Brendan Powell, jockey."

💬 Comment: Ascot winner 22 days ago but 6lb higher now and that demands a career-best performance
🔦 Spotlight: Back from a break to floor an in-form rival at Ascot (2m1f, good) three weeks ago, taking his chasing strike-rate to 4-14; 2lb wrong here, so he's now 6lb higher and that surely demands a career-best performance at the age of nine.
Horse quote: 2025-03-30 at Ascot (17f): "Coastguard Station is quite a quirky individual, hence why he has the headgear on. Even though he's keen, he can often get there and think he's done enough - Henry Oliver, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won his first four over fences but it's all gone pear shaped; ran no race last month
🔦 Spotlight: Won his first four starts over fences last May-July, all small-field handicaps (2m-2m1f; good or good to firm); however, it's all gone pear shaped since and he ran no race at Newbury last month when back from a break.
Horse quote: 2024-07-21 at Stratford (17f): "Matterhorn is going the right way very rapidly and we've got 12 months with him as a novice as well. His jumping is fantastic and that'll put him in good stead in the handicaps or novice chases. What we might do, subject to a discussion with Johnny [de la Hey, owner], is go for a 25,000GBP chase in August. We might then give him a break and try to pick up a nice early October novice chase if the ground is fast - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has won half of his ten starts over fences but classier contests find him out, as was the case in the Grand Annual (33-1); others much preferred.
Horse quote: 2023-09-18 at Worcester (16.5f): "Blinkers have been the making of Fringill Dike. For some reason over hurdles he just lost his confidence a little bit, he didn't like being crowded. The instant we put blinkers on, he was just a different horse. Life is going to get tougher now as his mark is getting towards 130 and the better jumpers will be coming out before too long. There's a race at the first meeting at Wetherby that may suit as long as the ground hasn't gone too slow by then - Jedd O'Keefe, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a five-timer at Ascot in November (2m1f, good) but he couldn't keep winning and his subsequent struggles continued in the Grand Annual; remains opposable, despite the handicapper offering some respite.
Horse quote: 2024-11-02 at Ascot (17f): "Martator is one of the few horses I'm happy to run on this sort of ground. He's very small, usually the smallest in any race he's in, and he's light on his feet. He ran on similar ground back here in the spring and obviously enjoyed it. He's probably improved for his summer break and needed to, because this was a step up again. He's an extraordinary horse and a bit of a character. When I walk out into the field back home I can guarantee you he's always the first horse to come out of the pack to say good morning. He's really inquisitive and I think that's why the cheekpieces help as it gives him less opportunity to be interested in what's going on around him! - Venetia Williams, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."
