🔦 Spotlight: Won a Newton Abbot bumper for Rod Millman just under two years ago, but off 553 days before reappearing over hurdles for this yard and has shown little; needs the switch to blinkers from cheekpieces to have a positive effect.

💬 Comment: Showed ability over hurdles early last year, but has gone the wrong way; cheekpieces on
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winning pointer who showed ability over hurdles early last year, but went the wrong way and has been pulled up in her last two starts (one a chase); cheekpieces enlisted on this second start since wind surgery and a resurgence is required.
