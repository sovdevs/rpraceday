🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rapidly improving sprinter; up 7lb in a stronger race but may not have reached her ceiling
🔦 Spotlight: Threw away a winning opportunity by hanging badly right on her handicap debut at Wolverhampton in January but she's raced near the stands' rail at Newcastle and Southwell since and beat another hugely 📈 progressive sprinter in good fashion on both occasions; up 7lb in a stronger race but she looks the type to hold her own in better company.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 on Tapeta, showing good speed to win 5f novices at Newcastle and here; handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Looked an extremely difficult ride on his first two starts but he was ✂️ gelded afterwards and has looked a different proposition this winter, third at Kempton (6f) before two front-running 5f wins at Newcastle and here; hit with a 12lb rise for the latest success and he'll need to improve again to make a winning handicap debut.
