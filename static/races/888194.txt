🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to match form of last season's wide-margin marathon win but still considered
🔦 Spotlight: Took form to whole new level when wide-margin winner of Edinburgh National at Musselburgh (3m7f, good to soft) in first-time visor last season; yet to match that performance this term and didn't get far when fitted with blinkers for this year's Edinburgh National but he's on a good mark and the new headgear may yet prompt a revival.

💬 Comment: Second in this race last year and bounced back to form in first-time blinkers last month
🔦 Spotlight: Bounced back to form in first-time blinkers at Bangor (3m5f, soft) last month, winning North Wales National under Lucy Turner; it's hard to tell whether the new headgear will continue to have a positive effect, and the forecast quicker ground here is probably not ideal, but he's still 5lb lower than when second in this race a year ago.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in valuable Haydock handicap in November but pulled up since; best on slow ground?
🔦 Spotlight: 3-7 over fences; ran well when third (albeit well held in the end) in valuable Haydock handicap (3m1f, soft) on seasonal debut in November but was pulled up at Wincanton last month and the drying ground may not be ideal for him here.
