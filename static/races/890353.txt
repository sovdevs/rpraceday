🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not easy to predict but last win was over C&D and she's well treated on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Not easy to predict and was well held at Lingfield (7f, AW) 19 days ago but her last win was over C&D (good) last August and that was off 2lb higher; player if she can get back near that level.
Horse quote: 2024-08-09 at Brighton (6f): "I was a bit worried about the ground this morning because I was here yesterday when we had all that rain. Bear To Dream hadn't run for a while so I was worried about her getting caught out on that tacky ground, but she was obviously fitter than I thought she was. She's very straightforward. She does plenty at home and Kaiya's [Fraser] has given her a great ride. That's his first winner for us and we've been using him for a bit. He has a real nice way of riding - Michael Attwater, trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On workable mark but her form is up and down and both wins were as a 2yo
🔦 Spotlight: Dual turf winner (5f) for Keith Dalgleish as a 2yo but she's drawn a blank since; has finished close up in three of her last six runs but it was a tame effort at Lingfield (6f, AW) two weeks ago and she needs to bounce back again after that.
