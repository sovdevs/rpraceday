💬 Comment: Back to form over C&D last time, yard going well and interesting in first-time visor
🔦 Spotlight: 7f winner here; hasn't had anywhere near as many chances as some of these; ran well on second start after wind surgery when third to the in-form Raft Up over C&D last time; now down in grade with first-time visor replacing cheekpieces; interesting for yard which has won with four of last seven runners.

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing last time and has had a few chances since last win but likes it here and a reproduction of his short-head second to subsequent dual winner Pockley over C&D last month should ensure he runs well.
