üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Limerick winner in December and the third has advertised the form really well; big chance
üî¶ Spotlight: Dual-winning handicap hurdler including last time out at Limerick (2m3f, yielding to soft) in December; Duffys Hodey (third) won twice subsequently before finishing runner-up off 111 so there's every reason to believe he's still nicely treated.
