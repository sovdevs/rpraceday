🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy winner off this mark on the AW latest; may have improved since last on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Has won three of his last four races and did it easily after a break at Kempton (6f) off this very mark; rated 8lb higher on the AW but perhaps a better horse now than when last seen on turf.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed at Bath and better on turf, as Southwell last time reminded us
🔦 Spotlight: Impressed from the front at Bath (5f, good to firm) last month for an eighth career success; wasn't beaten too far under a penalty (this mark) at Southwell and she's better on turf.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Sandown (5f): "We've spent all year trying to get Lil Guff to win. Oisin had us worried halfway through. They were going too quickly and he was right to take back. He just needed the gap and you always need a bit of luck against that rail. She's won seven times so you can't complain but she needs quick ground and she's just never really had it this year. She's in at Ascot but we'll see how she is in the morning - Daniel Kubler, joint-trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: All three runs on the AW; unbeaten in novices (6f/5f) but was noticeably weak in the market ahead of handicap debut at Lingfield (5f) and never threatened; bit to prove on the back of that.

💬 Comment: Off since last July when a novice winner for Tom Clover; could be on a good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in her first two races before getting off the mark by 3l in a 5f novice at Lingfield (good to firm; first-time tongue-tie); that was in July but looks well in on that form given the runner-up has progressed; bought for 11,000gns out of Tom Clover's yard.
