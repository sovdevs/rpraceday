🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two promising runs in Ireland last year; sold for 40,000gns in January; now tongue tied
🔦 Spotlight: Promising debut effort at Navan last October (6f, good to yielding) when third of 19 at a big price; made a threatening move in a 1m maiden at Dundalk in December but was outstayed late on; sold out of Mark Fahey's yard for 40,000gns in January; return to sprinting looks a good move and new connections quick to fit a tongue tie; major player.

🔦 Spotlight: Both C&D runs in recent weeks have been encouraging but the bare form of her third three weeks ago can't be rated too highly; open to improvement though and she's more appealing than many.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: BHA-rated just 58 after her three runs thus far; improvement a must to win a maiden
🔦 Spotlight: Recorded an RPR in the 50s in two runs as a 2yo; enjoyed a soft lead over 7f here on her return five weeks ago but still dropped away to finish last of the four runners; improvement a must.

🔦 Spotlight: Whiff of promise on his Beverley debut (5f, good) last September but he failed to build on it at Southwell one month later; can do better this year but perhaps once moving into handicaps.
