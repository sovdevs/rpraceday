🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won gamely on last month's handicap debut; up from 2m4f and on much better ground here
🔦 Spotlight: Won gamely from the front on last month's handicap debut at Sandown (2m4f, heavy) and is now 2-4 over hurdles; 5lb higher here but 🚀 open to further improvement if this different trip-and-ground combination also suits.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-3 in maiden/novice hurdles; makes handicap debut after a break; could have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Signed off in Ireland with Wexford maiden win (3m, good; first-time cheekpieces) last summer and followed up for new stable in four-runner Southwell novice (3m, good; front pair well clear) in October; makes handicap debut after 170-day absence but could still have more to offer.

💬 Comment: Low-mileage 7yo who started off for Dan Skelton with three good runs this winter
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 7yo who built upon a good stable debut when scoring at Warwick (3m2f, soft) in December; had to settle for fourth when back at Warwick (3m1f, good to soft) in January but should be okay on the forecast faster ground here and may still have a bigger run in him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice went close in the autumn and his last two runs were better than the bare form
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from layoff with two close seconds in the autumn (2m7f, good to soft/good), and next two runs were both better than the bare form suggests; still on a workable mark and benefits from Callum Pritchard's useful claim today; one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: 2-13 over hurdles; ran fairly well when fourth over 2m at Ludlow last month and is suited by good ground but probably needs a career-best performance on this first venture beyond 2m5f.
