🔦 Spotlight: 2-19 on turf, more effective at Dundalk (4-22), twice second there this year; ended last season's campaign with a fourth placing at Fairyhouse; a long way below his best at the Curragh two weeks ago; should not be ruled out with Colin Keane aboard for the first. time
Horse quote: 2022-04-25 at Naas (8f): "Mullacash Buzz has been some little horse for us and can go out on his holidays now and has earned it. He's won three for us now. He's been a superstar for us - Tom Dowling, trainer"

💬 Comment: Won this event last year when 4lb higher, stayed on without threatening here last week
🔦 Spotlight: Won this event last year when 4lb higher; lost form after Ballinrobe third last June; stayed on without threatening when eighth of 15 here last week; perhpas unwise to rule out.
Horse quote: 2023-11-22 at Dundalk (AW) (7f): "River Derwent was starting to show a little bit of form of late. Adam (Caffrey) was outstanding on him, it's nice to see him recapture a bit of form. He handled that surface well and we'll keep coming here - Dick Donohoe, trainer, talking to Racing TV."
