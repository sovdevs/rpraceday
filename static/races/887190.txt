🔦 Spotlight: Made it 2-4 over fences when winning at Huntingdon (2m4f, good to soft) last month and good second at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) since behind one who has followed up; fine on soft ground and this 📈 progressive 6yo can play another leading role.

🔦 Spotlight: Clear second at Huntingdon (2m7f, good to soft) last month on his first run beyond an extended 2m4f and the 📈 progressive winner has followed up; also effective on soft ground and could have more to offer at this sort of trip; ran well in these blinkers two starts ago (wore a visor last time).
