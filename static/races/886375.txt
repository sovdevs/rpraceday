🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Resurgent 5yo, who has won his last four and still looks feasibly treated; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Resurgent 5yo, who has scored on AW in his last four starts and he looked value for more than the winning margin at Wolverhampton (1m4f) 12 days ago; up another 4lb but he remains feasibly treated and should get a decent tow into this race; major player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Held in hat-trick bid over C&D latest; 11lb higher now but she has potential at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Improved form upped to middle distances when winning twice here (1m2f/1m4f) last month; hot favourite when unpenalised in hat-trick bid at Wolverhampton but she came up short in third and an 11lb rise has now kicked in; needs to step up again after that last run but her last success was by 11l and she still has potential at this trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returns from 261 days off but she needs watching in market back on AW
🔦 Spotlight: Struggled at Carlisle (1m3f, soft) in her final run last spring but she was in good form on Tapeta before that, including two wins in classified events (1m4f); now returns after 261 days off but she's on a workable mark and needs checking in market on back on AW.
