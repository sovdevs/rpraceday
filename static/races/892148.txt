üí¨ Comment: Didn't recover from big hike for Fairyhouse win last summer; back down to a fair mark
üî¶ Spotlight: Sole win came over 6f at Fairyhouse last summer for which she got a huge hike which anchored her in four starts afterwards; now dropped to 5lb above that winning mark and squeezes into this grade on first run since August.
