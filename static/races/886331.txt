🔦 Spotlight: Went close in 6f maiden at Newcastle (Tapeta) in November on his third start; boxing on when badly hampered on handicap debut over 7f here in December and may not have been suited by blinkers (now left off) here a fortnight ago (7f; failed to settle); brings potential to this longer trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has had excuses here in both handicaps (7f); brings potential to this longer trip
🔦 Spotlight: Went close in 6f maiden at Newcastle (Tapeta) in November on his third start; boxing on when badly hampered on handicap debut over 7f here in December and may not have been suited by blinkers (now left off) here a fortnight ago (7f; failed to settle); brings potential to this longer trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Close second on his stable and handicap debut at Lingfield (1m) last month and again ran well when third here (8.6f) nine days ago; should have a part to play if stamina isn't an issue over this longer trip.
