🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Navan winner on favoured heavy; 5lb rise fair but quicker ground not be ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Last year's winner had been consistent in defeat until recording second career win in 2m5f Navan mares' handicap early this month in emphatic style, seeining it out strongly in favoured testing conditions; 5lb rise fair but quicker ground here may not be ideal.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Much improved hurdler this term; back chasing off 14lb lower mark so obvious appeal
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m4f Limerick handicap chase last year and has been in fine form hurdling this term, winning at Limerick and Cork and most recently chasing home a clear-cut winner at former venue in December; back from a short break and resumes over fences off a 14lb lower mark than hurdles so of obvious appeal.

🔦 Spotlight: Proving a better chaser than hurdler, notably latest two runs here on better ground, narrowly beaten in 2m handicap before relishing step up to today's trip to land 2m5f beginners nine days ago; up 7lb for those runs but more improvement likely on preferred ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back to a more suitable trip here but inexperience a concern
🔦 Spotlight: Just fair maiden hurdler, best form at around 2m4f-2m6f; back from a break for chase debut here last month, no threat over inadequate trip but staying on when effectively brought down at last in 2m handicap; back to a more suitable trip here but inexperience a concern.
