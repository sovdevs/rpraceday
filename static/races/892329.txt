💬 Comment: AW winner, 0-10 on turf, placed off 1lb higher at this trip, not discounted on stable bow
🔦 Spotlight: 1-3 on the AW for Charlie Johnston but 0-10 on turf, though she has run well in defeat; bought for 10,000gns at Tattersalls H-I-T Sale in October; has placed off 1lb higher over this trip on good ground; not discounted on stable and Irish debut.

💬 Comment: 0-4 on turf, went close off 1lb higher on h'cap bow at Clonmel, yard in form, considered
🔦 Spotlight: Seven race maiden is 0-4 on turf; went close off 63 on handicap debut at Clonmel last September (9.5f, good), staying on well, and is 1lb lower now; returns from a break with her yard in form and the tongue tie worn last time at Dundalk is left off; considered.
