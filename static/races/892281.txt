🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two 6f runs at Newcastle, overcoming inexperience to win 5 weeks ago; 7f a plus; wide draw
🔦 Spotlight: Promise amid inexperience at Newcastle on his debut in February; still looked green when winning a 6f maiden back at Newcastle five weeks ago; comfortably on top at the finish and brings potential now stepping up to 7f for his handicap debut; lower draw would have been preferred, though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two 6f runs at Newcastle, overcoming inexperience to win 5 weeks ago; 7f a plus; wide draw
🔦 Spotlight: Promise amid inexperience at Newcastle on his debut in February; still looked green when winning a 6f maiden back at Newcastle five weeks ago; comfortably on top at the finish and brings potential now stepping up to 7f for his handicap debut; lower draw would have been preferred, though.
