🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in both handicaps and this could be a good opportunity to get off the mark
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 but fair third on handicap debut at Ayr (2m5f, soft) in January and runner-up at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft) since; today's race could be a good opportunity to get off the mark if he handles the forecast better ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Modest on the Flat with a poor strike-rate and may not be straightforward, but he was a good third at Newcastle (2m4f, good) three weeks ago on his handicap hurdle debut; in the shake-up if backing up that performance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His form has deteriorated but he was a fair fourth last time and is another 2lb lower here
🔦 Spotlight: His form has deteriorated but he's dropped down the weights and was a fair fourth at Catterick last month; another 2lb lower today and this two-time course winner might not be far away in first-time cheekpieces.
