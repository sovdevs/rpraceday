💬 Comment: 0-16 but he went close at Wolverhampton on Monday and has claims if he can back that up
🔦 Spotlight: Another 16-race maiden but he's dropped a long way in the weights and was runner-up at Wolverhampton (5f; Street Life third) on Monday; that was an eyecatching effort from off the pace and has claims if he can repeat that form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on track with placed efforts at Wolverhampton last twice and he's respected
🔦 Spotlight: Eight-time AW winner who has got back on track with placed efforts at Wolverhampton (5f, Tapeta) in last two runs; this is a quick turnaround after his third Monday but he has a better draw this time and he's respected.
Horse quote: 2021-09-12 at Haydock (5f): "I let Street Life bowl along and as soon as I asked him, he just took off. Last time I rode him, he missed the break and it was game over. He was a lot more relaxed in the stalls - Morgan Cole, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Overall record of 3-64 but he's won twice at 5f (Tapeta/turf) this year and was a good front-running fourth over 6f at Redcar (beaten less than 2l) ten days ago; remains well handicapped on his old form and he's a 🔥 big player back in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back after wind op with fair fifth at Thirsk but he needs to build on that back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: On reduced mark and he returned after wind surgery with fair fifth in big field at Thirsk (6f, good) last month; could get involved if he can build on that but last win was in November 2023 and he's 1-20 on AW.
Horse quote: 2023-08-10 at Yarmouth (6f): "The plan was to take a lead on Masterclass and he picked up nicely when I asked him. He liked the ground and has a good attitude - Brandon Wilkie, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconsistent 11-race maiden and he was beaten 11l at Newcastle latest; down the list
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up off 2lb higher over C&D in February but he's not easy to predict and was beaten 11l at Newcastle last time; that took his record to 0-11 and others are more convincing; hood worn in last two runs is removed.
