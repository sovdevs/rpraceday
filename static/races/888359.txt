🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won maiden hurdle at Taunton in January and is in good hands to continue to progress
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who landed a maiden hurdle at Taunton (2m, good to soft) in January when wearing a first-time tongue-tie (retained) on her first outing since a second wind operation; needs another step forward on this handicap debut but she's lightly raced and in good hands to continue to progress.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well last time and retains potential now back on better ground for handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably made all in three-runner maiden on hurdle/stable debut at Plumpton (2m, good) in November; her two subsequent novice runs have been on soft ground and she was a creditable second behind Tour Ovalie at Taunton (2m, soft) last month; benefits from sizeable pull in the weights with that rival today and retains potential now back on better ground for handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Listed runner-up on good to soft in November; this return to better ground could be ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Won on hurdle debut at Market Rasen (2m4f, good to soft) in November and good Listed second at Newbury (2m, good to soft) next time; pulled up in January (heavy) and no match for Game Colours at Lingfield (soft) last month, but today's return to better ground could be right up her street.
