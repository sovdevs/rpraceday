🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in small fields over an extended 2m3f on heavy going at Chepstow last February/March; back to some form despite mistakes on last two outings, over C&D first occasion and trying 2m6f on latest, which puts him firmly in the picture.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won five soft-ground chases last season; took a step back up the ladder on latest outing
🔦 Spotlight: Won five soft-ground chases last season (the first two over about 2m4f, the rest about 2m) and latest start was his best form this term, with first-time cheekpieces; probably needs another step back up the ladder but he does not face many rivals.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unseated on handicap/chase debut; very lightly raced 6yo who could still have potential
🔦 Spotlight: First and second in his first two novice hurdles but tailed off next time, all on soft; in contention when he unseated on handicap/chase debut at Warwick (2m4f; 22-1) three weeks ago but that was six from home; very lightly raced 6yo who could therefore still have potential.

🔦 Spotlight: Won five soft-ground chases last season (the first two over about 2m4f, the rest about 2m) and latest start was his best form this term, with first-time cheekpieces; probably needs another step back up the ladder but he does not face many rivals.

🔦 Spotlight: Three hurdling wins in his time and 2-4 over fences after a highly 📈 progressive campaign last winter, nearly all 2m4f at Wincanton; acts on soft, unraced on heavy; absent 396 days but has a fine chance if he's fit enough.

🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in small fields over an extended 2m3f on heavy going at Chepstow last February/March; back to some form despite mistakes on last two outings, over C&D first occasion and trying 2m6f on latest, which puts him firmly in the picture.

🔦 Spotlight: Won five soft-ground chases last season (the first two over about 2m4f, the rest about 2m) and latest start was his best form this term, with first-time cheekpieces; probably needs another step back up the ladder but he does not face many rivals.

🔦 Spotlight: First and second in his first two novice hurdles but tailed off next time, all on soft; in contention when he unseated on handicap/chase debut at Warwick (2m4f; 22-1) three weeks ago but that was six from home; very lightly raced 6yo who could therefore still have potential.
