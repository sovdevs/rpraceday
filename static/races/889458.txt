üí¨ Comment: Ready winner of Fred Winter at Cheltenham; can take the step up to Graded level in stride
üî¶ Spotlight: Big üöÄ improver back on a sounder surface when a comfortable winner of the Fred Winter handicap at the Cheltenham Festival (extended 2m, good to soft) 23 days ago, cruising into it and drawing 6l clear from the last for only hand riding; definitely capable of better and can take the step up to Grade 1 level in his stride.

üí¨ Comment: Ready winner of Fred Winter at Cheltenham; can take the step up to Graded level in stride
üî¶ Spotlight: Big üöÄ improver back on a sounder surface when a comfortable winner of the Fred Winter handicap at the Cheltenham Festival (extended 2m, good to soft) 23 days ago, cruising into it and drawing 6l clear from the last for only hand riding; definitely capable of better and can take the step up to Grade 1 level in his stride.

üí¨ Comment: Pulled up on British debut but different proposition when winning Kempton Grade 2 since
üî¶ Spotlight: Bought for 450,000euros after placing in two of his three hurdle races in France; raced too freely when pulled up in Grade 2 at Cheltenham (soft) on British debut but showed why new connections went to such a big amount to acquire him when winning the Adonis at Kempton (2m, good to soft) in February; that doesn't look strong Grade 2 form, though.

üí¨ Comment: Won sole Flat start in France but this is a very tough introduction to hurdles
üî¶ Spotlight: Poniros showed it is possible to win a Grade 1 juvenile on hurdle debut at Cheltenham recently but he was battle hardened from some strong handicaps on the Flat, whereas this son of Mastercraftsman has had only one start on the level, winning a 1m4f conditions event in France (good to soft) in September; can only be watched.
