🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready winner of Fred Winter at Cheltenham; can take the step up to Graded level in stride
🔦 Spotlight: Big 🚀 improver back on a sounder surface when a comfortable winner of the Fred Winter handicap at the Cheltenham Festival (extended 2m, good to soft) 23 days ago, cruising into it and drawing 6l clear from the last for only hand riding; definitely capable of better and can take the step up to Grade 1 level in his stride.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready winner of Fred Winter at Cheltenham; can take the step up to Graded level in stride
🔦 Spotlight: Big 🚀 improver back on a sounder surface when a comfortable winner of the Fred Winter handicap at the Cheltenham Festival (extended 2m, good to soft) 23 days ago, cruising into it and drawing 6l clear from the last for only hand riding; definitely capable of better and can take the step up to Grade 1 level in his stride.
