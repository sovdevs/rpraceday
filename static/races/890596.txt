💬 Comment: C&D winner; bids for a hat-trick but latest success came in a messy contest; vulnerable
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner who bids for a hat-trick after wins on good ground at Exeter (2m3f) and Taunton (2m7f) last month (has won twice on soft); latest success came at the expense of two other finishers in a messy contest, though, and another 3lb rise may leave him vulnerable.

💬 Comment: 15lb below last winning mark but has failed to complete in eight of his last nine starts
🔦 Spotlight: 15lb lower than when beating three rivals at Pumpton (3m2f, good to soft) in October 2023 when trained by Lucy Wadham, but has failed to complete in eight of his last nine starts; may have won had he not fallen heavily two out back there 16 days ago so he retains ability, but very risky.

💬 Comment: 2lb above last winning mark; ran well when third at Chepstow last month; could play a part
🔦 Spotlight: Getting towards the veteran stage, but only 2lb higher than when winning at Warwick (2m4f, good) last May and last month's third of eight at Chepstow (2m3f, good) showed that the ability remains; could play a part if repeating that performance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner who is 1lb lower than when successful over hurdles at Stratford in October
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins for another yard in the middle of 2023 including one over C&D, but only success in 16 starts for this yard came over hurdles at Stratford (2m3f, heavy) in October; now 1lb lower, though, so a case can be made.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who has shown ability over fences and had an excuse last time; still to prove that he wants this far, though.
Horse quote: 2023-02-18 at Wincanton (15f): "Universal Secret is a big baby. He's growing all the time and is a chaser, but we knew he'd win a hurdle race. We won't do anything fancy but he'll go chasing next season - Helen Nelmes, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 under rules; 2lb wrong but may find the return to this intermediate trip more suitable having found 3m too far on his final start over hurdles and 2m too sharp when a remote third of five on chase debut; a better performance wouldn't surprise.
