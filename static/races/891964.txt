üí¨ Comment: Won 2m handicap here off 90 last month, forging clear; seemingly wants softer conditions
üî¶ Spotlight: Ordinary form in maidens; returned in February with fine third over 2m4f at Punchestown off 90 before winning 2m handicap here off that mark last month, forging clear; seemingly wants soft conditions but must be respected.
