🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handicapper quick to ease off but a first-time hood will need to make a difference
🔦 Spotlight: Heavy-ground novice winner for Andrew Balding as a 3yo who's struggled badly for two yards since; the handicapper's been quick to ease off but a first-time hood (worn blinkers once before) will need to make a difference.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returns from a break on a career-low mark having struggled in three runs in the winter
🔦 Spotlight: Returns from a short break on a career-low mark having struggled in three runs in the winter; won for cheekpieces first going on and again for them being refitted last autumn, so has that in his favour, and is well suited by switchback tracks.
