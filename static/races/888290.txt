🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third over 2m at Ayr; form has worked out well and pedigree suggests this trip will suit
🔦 Spotlight: Course bumper winner (soft) who was third at Ayr (2m, soft) in January on her second hurdle start and that form has worked out well; her attractive pedigree suggests she'll be suited by this longer trip and she holds leading claims provided the better ground isn't an issue.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner who was a fair 3rd over C&D on her second hurdle start; could be thereabouts
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner (3m, good to yielding) whose hurdle debut at Haydock wasn't without promise and she built on that when third over this C&D (good to soft) in December; returns from a break and could be thereabouts.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in point/novice hurdle; pulled up latest but on heavy ground; each-way possible
🔦 Spotlight: Point runner-up (2m4f, good) who went very close on rules debut at Ayr (2m4f, soft) in January; pulled up at Lingfield since but perhaps the heavy ground was too much; each-way contender if bouncing back.
