🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had Only By Night just ahead at Cheltenham but he wins this if he cuts out the mistakes
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 5yo; won Triumph Hurdle (2m1f, heavy) at last year's Festival; despite some novicey jumps, he made it 2-2 over fences when winning Grade 1 Irish Arkle at Leopardstown (2m1f, yielding) by 9l in February; made shuddering errors late on when third in the Arkle at Cheltenham, but rallied in the closing stages and was beaten only 0.75l; had Only By Night just ahead on that occasion but he will win if he cuts out the mistakes.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (16f): "I was delighted with Majborough to finish third after the three mistakes he made. So we know he has a huge engine but we've got to get his jumping right. While I'm disappointed not to win, we're happy that we have a horse with an engine. I'm surprised that he did that but that's what can happen in the heat of battle here. He seems fine - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive mare is the biggest danger to Majborough after her Arkle second at Cheltenham
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive mare whose record of 3-4 since switched to chasing features wins in Cork Grade 2 and Exeter Listed event, both against her own sex; belied her 25-1 odds with excellent second in dramatic Arkle most recently, edging ahead and looking the likely winner on the run-in only to be collared by the fast-finishing winner close home; had Majborough behind on that occasion but she might be reliant on the Mullins runner to falter in the jumping department again.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (16f): "Only By Night ran a great race and I'm really happy with her. I don't have an idea what we'll do with her next; this was the plan - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy sort but struggled in Grade 1 company at Aintree and similar story awaits here
🔦 Spotlight: Prolific over hurdles (including Grade 2 wins) and 1l second to classy yardstick in Grade 2 Kingmaker at Warwick (2m, soft) in February on second chase start, before going one better in Grade 2 Pendil at Kempton (2m4f, good to soft); well below that level last time when fifth in Grade 1 Manifesto Novices' at Aintree and he's likely to struggle against the market principles.
Horse quote: 2025-02-22 at Kempton (20.5f): "I am amazed Rubaud has won. I thought down the back he was in a bit of trouble. As Harry said, he hates ground that like. It's the first time he has won on soft ground and he's a much better horse on better ground. He had a hard enough race at Warwick the other day and two weeks is quick enough but he toughed it out and stayed on really strongly, which was a doubt over this trip. I'd say we'll freshen him up now and go to Aintree for the two and a half mile novices' chase (Manifesto Novices' Chase) - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shock 150-1 beginners' win at Leopardstown; tough tasks the last twice; up against it here
🔦 Spotlight: Physically imposing sort; placed twice in point-to-points; caused major upset with 150-1 Leopardstown beginners' win (2m1f, good to yielding) on rules debut in December; set a tough task in the Irish Arkle at the DRF but ran respectable in the circumstances; no match for Champ Kiely when runner-up in Navan Grade 3 over 2m in March; unlikely winner.
Horse quote: 2024-12-27 at Leopardstown (17f): "I expected him to run really well as his homework had been good. I thought Jeannot Lapin was a proper horse. I bought him off Sam Curling and I couldn't find what was wrong with him. He was maybe a bit sick when he ran in his point-to-points or something. He did a piece of work around Tipperary two weeks ago and showed me enough to suggest he'd be competitive in one of these. He's massive but he was a shell in May - Gearoid O'Loughlin, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third in 2m4f Cork Grade 3 in November but has plenty to find on these terms; more needed
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile dual-purpose performer is 3-17 on the Flat and 8-38 under rules; won Galway beginners' chase (2m2f, good to yielding) last September and third in 2m4f Cork Grade 3 in November; ran well on the Flat after 155-day break when beaten 2l at Gowran over 1m6f last month; plenty to find on these terms.
Horse quote: 2024-09-09 at Galway (18.5f): "Jesse Evans was foot perfect the whole way round, indeed the mistake he made at Killarney is the only one he has ever made and it probably did him good. He is a good ground horse and my dream for him would be to come back next year for the Galway Plate - Noel Meade, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Career-best when second in Grade 1 at Aintree but likely to come up well short in this
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 4-10 (hurdles/fences) for current yard; scored off a low weight in Class 2 handicap chase at Doncaster (2m, good) in March off 130; faced a much stiffer assignment in Grade 1 Maghull Novices' Chase at Aintree but produced career-best when runner-up to Kalif Du Berlais, no match for the winner; deserves a crack at this but likely to come up short.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Doncaster (16.5f): "Brookie hasn't run badly all season and has been freshened up after taking on Sir Gino at Kempton last time. I knew conditions would suit and it's worked out perfectly - Ben Godfrey, rider."
