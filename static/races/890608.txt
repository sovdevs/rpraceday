🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: High in the weights but every chance with a repeat of his third in the County Hurdle
🔦 Spotlight: Travelled best throughout when winning last year's County Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival and was third in this year's renewal off an 8lb higher mark (few of these behind), having previously finished fifth in the Melbourne Cup; nudged up another 2lb but should cope with this tight track; Harry Cobden won last week's Scottish National for the yard; major player; often held up.
Horse quote: 2024-11-05 at Flemington (16f): "Absurde ran a cracker considering he got shuffled back further than anticipated and Kerrin wanted to be. He had to ride the race presented to him and he rode a terrific race to get back up to be fifth. We'll keep coming back if we have the ammunition and I think Absurde will return. The owners are keen as they've had a wonderful time. We've bought a few new horses that might make into Melbourne Cup horses, so the quest is still on - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's winner off 13lb lower; good front-running sixth in the County Hurdle
🔦 Spotlight: 13lb lower when winning this 12 months ago and faces stronger opposition this time; however, he ran well from the front (as is his way) to be sixth in the County Hurdle and his running style is better suited to this sharper track; unlikely to get an easy lead but can see him hanging around to be competitive.
Horse quote: 2023-10-27 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "I came here pretty confident. I'm usually a pessimistic bugger but I rode Our Champ myself in a bit of work the other day with Aucunrisque and he went extremely well. We don't usually have them off the bridle but Aucunrisque was struggling and I weighed two stone more than the lad on him. There's loads of options for him. I might look at those novice Graded races as time goes on, he's a very experienced jumper and races like the Dovecote could be an option. He's got plenty of pace - Chris Gordon, trainer."

💬 Comment: Only 1lb above his last winning mark but hasn't truly threatened this season
🔦 Spotlight: Only 1lb above his last winning mark but hasn't truly threatened this season and no better for cheekpieces the last twice, in the County Hurdle and then over 2m4f at Aintree; he wouldn't be the obvious answer here.
Horse quote: 2023-12-02 at Newbury (16.5f): "Hansard ran a very good race at Aintree last season, but is bigger and stronger now. I was slightly disappointed with him at Wincanton last time but he might have been beaten by a better horse, he was spot on today and looked sharper in the paddock, while his work had improved at home. He's a nice horse. There was pace in the race, which is what he wants as he's a strong traveller. He's in a valuable handicap hurdle at Ascot just before Christmas and he does all the right things so you'd think he could be a Graded horse, but he needs to improve again - Gary Moore, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Front-runner who wasn't beaten far in the Imperial Cup; this track should suit him
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up in this 12 months ago on his sole previous visit to Plumpton (the only time he's worn cheekpieces); confined to only three runs in the meantime and wasn't beaten at all far off this mark in the Imperial Cup at Sandown, where it's never easy to make all; considered for title-chasing yard.
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Ascot (15.5f): "It's great for Tristan and he gets on well with this horse. Knickerbockerglory has always promised to do well and he loves soft and heavy ground. We'll keep running in these handicaps over hurdles and hopefully he can have more success on this sort of ground - Tom Messenger, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Needs a strong pace at this trip, which she got when winning so well at Aintree; up 9lb
🔦 Spotlight: Smart novice who missed all of last season but looks better than ever judged on her comprehensive defeat of a well-backed novice in a deep handicap at Aintree (2m, good); reliant on a good pace at this trip (stays 3m) and she should get one here; 9lb higher than last time with Tristan Durrell again claiming 3lb.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Aintree (16.5f): "I had a conversation with the two owners about an hour ago, and while I wasn't saying we definitely shouldn't run on the ground I wasn't convinced it was going to suit her. Deciding to run today is down to them and I take my hat off to them. I'm so proud of She's A Saint. It just shows what can happen when you give them a bit of time when it's needed. And she's got a great ride off Tristan [Durrell] as they've gone very hard in front - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very solid effort when fifth in the County Hurdle and blinkers are tried this afternoon
🔦 Spotlight: Has got himself well handicapped again and he was always prominent when fifth in the County Hurdle; stays further than this so expect another forward ride and, with blinkers replacing cheekpieces worn for his last three races, he could have a part to play.
Horse quote: 2023-03-11 at Sandown (16f): "Spirit D'Aunou was a four-year-old carrying a lot of weight out there so it wasn't going to be easy for him. He is still a baby learning and he is going to improve with racing and time. I'd like to think he would go to Ascot in early April for that (valuable juvenile) handicap there - Gary Moore, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has struggled in handicaps since taking a notable scalp in a Grade 2 in December
🔦 Spotlight: Beating the top-class novice Romeo Coolio in a 2m Grade 2 in December (yielding) scuppered his handicap mark and he's struggled since, latterly when 50-1 for the Martin Pipe at Cheltenham last month.
Horse quote: 2024-12-01 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "I thought every horse that we ran had a chance if they ran their best race. Tounsivator might have had the fitness edge on them as he'd been running for us during the summer. The ground conditions probably suited him better today and I'm very happy with him. I'd imagine we'll go on to Christmas now - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not as good as he was but still capable and now running in his first handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Former top-notcher who has understandably lost some of his old zip at the age of ten, but didn't run too badly in a Grade 3 last time and cheekpieces are fitted for his first handicap of any description; can't be ruled out.
Horse quote: 2024-03-31 at Cork (16f): "Sir Gerhard is a very good horse and this was a nice race for him. He jumped well, especially down the straight, and had plenty of class back in trip - Sean O'Keeffe, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ninth in the County Hurdle but he never threatened after losing his place mid-race
🔦 Spotlight: One of four for title-chasing Willie Mullins; his overall profile is hit and miss and, with this tight track in mind, it's worrying that he lost his position in the County Hurdle before running on into ninth; dropped a measly 1lb for that.
Horse quote: 2024-10-06 at Tipperary (16f): "Daddy Long Legs being back to a flat track and quick ground suited him. He's in graded territory now. I don't know if he's good enough for those good Grade 1s but that's the sea he is swimming in now - David Casey, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had turned a corner only to then flop at Aintree; the tongue-tie tried there is removed
🔦 Spotlight: Knows what these competitive handicaps are all about and had appeared to turn a corner with big runs at Musselburgh and Sandown only to then have a shocker at Aintree when reportedly never travelling; however, the first-time tongue-tie that joined his regular cheekpieces last time is now removed and that could be significant; possibilities despite being 2lb wrong.
Horse quote: 2024-02-03 at Musselburgh (15.5f): "Afadil enjoyed the ground and was given a great ride by Freddie (Gingell). He'll have an entry in the County Hurdle but perhaps the conditional jockeys' race at Aintree might be the race for him - Paul Nicholls, trainer."
