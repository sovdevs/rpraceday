🔦 Spotlight: Found Chepstow Grade 2 too tough on second start but successful on both other hurdles outings, asserting run-in at Wetherby (2m, soft; form working out well) in January; lightly raced and open to further progress; 🔥 big player.

🔦 Spotlight: Easy winner of sole Flat outing (2m, good to soft) last summer; promising start over hurdles when third at Kempton (2m, good to soft) in December; beaten at 2-7 at Plumpton next time but may have used up too much energy when clear mid-race; interesting on handicap debut with hood fitted.
