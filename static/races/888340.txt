🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a tough mark but strong form when runner-up last time at Exeter; very solid
🔦 Spotlight: Has been racking up the places since completing a hat-trick two years ago, a sure sign that he's high in the weights; however, again ran well at Exeter (2m7f, good to soft) last time and finished just ahead of last week's Pertemps Final runner-up Jeriko Du Reponet; raised another 2lb for that but he's very solid.

🔦 Spotlight: Chasing this season after wind surgery, running well in a Grade 2 first time out (3m, soft) before the last to finish in a Grade 1 at Christmas; could retain some potential back over hurdles as he's lightly raced and did finish runner-up in a Grade 2.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this last year and then two more; would go well if a change of headgear inspires
🔦 Spotlight: Improved for going this far for the first time when winning this 12 months ago, after which he went on to complete a hat-trick; pulled up in the Pertemps Final last week but he has run two good races this season and a change of headgear (usually wears cheekpieces) is an interesting angle.

💬 Comment: Up in grade and looks on a harsh mark; they have claimed 5lb the last twice as well
🔦 Spotlight: Clearcut winner in a first-time tongue-tie at Huntingdon (3m1f, good to soft) on his first venture beyond an extended 2m4f; went up 10lb though and was found wanting at Market Rasen (2m7f); he runs off an untouched mark here and they have claimed 5lb the last twice.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below his Irish form in three runs for current yard and now tries cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Only had five races for Gordon Elliott and his best two were the final two, including a maiden win; well below that level so far for David Pipe, in a 2m novice and two staying handicaps (latest after wind surgery); bit risky for now and tries cheekpieces.
