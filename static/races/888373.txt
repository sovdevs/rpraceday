🔦 Spotlight: Returned to some form when third off this mark at Warwick (3m1f, good to soft) and Ludlow (3m, soft) on her last two starts; career score is 1-19 and this is her chase debut, but her sole win (last May) was on good ground and only three opponents are declared.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best efforts in the mud and she has stacks to prove if the ground is good
🔦 Spotlight: All three wins were on soft or heavy, including a double over this sort of trip last February/March; if there's not been a downpour, it's therefore additionally disconcerting that her best efforts this term (in January) were on heavy and she has stacks to prove if the ground is good.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper here and made a winning start over fences at Fakenham (2m5f) in November; in contention when slipping up on penultimate start and not disgraced behind a runaway winner at Catterick (3m1f) latest, but a fair bit better would surely be required in normal circumstances and that latest run did not prove her stamina beyond 2m7f.
