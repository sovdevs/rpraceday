🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd on last two starts, vastly better form than anything shown by today's solitary rival
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Southwell bumper (good) last May; built on that with his last two runs over hurdles when second on good to soft at Wincanton (2m4f) and Kempton (2m5f), and that's vastly better form than anything shown by today's solitary rival.
