💬 Comment: Too keen when last seen in October but ran well; goes well fresh, one to consider
🔦 Spotlight: Modest Flat performer but much better hurdler, runner-up in Tipperary maiden last May and very fortunate winner when left clear by a last-flight faller at Killarney in October; later in month solid run in the circumstances in Sligo mares' handicap considering she was keen and none too fluent; back from a break but runs well fresh and ground to suit.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not the most consistent but penultimate Leopardstown effort gives him claims
🔦 Spotlight: Lost form after 2m1f Sligo win last August (soft) until much improved when chasing home a ready winner at Leopardstown last month on yielding; no show at Naas since raises questions but has to be considered on that penultimate run.
Horse quote: 2024-08-21 at Sligo (17.5f): "High Honour travelled for me all the way, just coming over the second-last he went to lug in, but when I pulled him out he got rolling for me. He was good and game - John Shinnick, rider."

💬 Comment: In fine form earlier in season but handicapper may just have his measure now
🔦 Spotlight: Relished a return to hurdles this season and was only narrowly denied in his hat-trick bid for Paul Hennessy at Gowran in January; struggled off 6lb higher at Limerick last month and handicapper just may have his measure right now.
Horse quote: 2025-01-15 at Clonmel (17f): "Falcon Park is just in good humour at the moment. I've no idea why he's hitting form but he's always shown more at home than he showed at the racecourse - Paul Hennessy, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-10-28 at Galway (16.5f): "Kaleosun got caught for a bit of speed at Cork. He stays well and I didn't want it to turn into a sprint. He handled the ground very well and stays well - Jack Kennedy, rider"
