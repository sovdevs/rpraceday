🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Absent since finishing down the field in York sales race in October; promise on AW before
🔦 Spotlight: Promise on AW on first two starts, making all at Wolverhampton last September; down the field in a York sales race (7f, soft) when last seen in October; capable of better this year but such progress is required.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran well at Newbury on his second 2yo run (6f, soft); should be sharper for recent return to action at Chelmsford (6f) but hopes rest on the step up to 7f and switch to handicaps sparking something extra.
