🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **CONNECTIONS**
🌱 Breeder: Ellis Stud Partnership
🏠 Owner: Philip Banfield (No previous owner(s))
👤 Trainer: Mike Murphy (1 previous trainers) last 14d Win SR (3.0 / 7.0 runs) (Rank: 2.0) RTF: 57.0 (OVR%: 13%)
🏇 Jockey: Rossa Ryan (Rank: 3.0) (5.0/ 36.0 runs) RTF: N/A (OVR%: 23%)
🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Making good progress as a sprinter with three 6f wins already this year, including C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly innocuous start to handicap career but he's a different horse now and added to an earlier C&D win with two at Southwell (6f) since, value for more than the narrow verdict in an amateur jockeys' race 12 days ago; good claims off just 3lb higher.
