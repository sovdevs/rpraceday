üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Making good progress as a sprinter with three 6f wins already this year, including C&D
üî¶ Spotlight: Fairly innocuous start to handicap career but he's a different horse now and added to an earlier C&D win with two at Southwell (6f) since, value for more than the narrow verdict in an amateur jockeys' race 12 days ago; good claims off just 3lb higher.

üî¶ Spotlight: Sole AW win over C&D as 3yo; on a losing run now but he might have ended it with a better passage at Southwell (6f, first-time hood) last month and he again went down narrowly at Wolverhampton since; wasn't on song at Newcastle latest but should be involved if adding cheekpieces helps.
