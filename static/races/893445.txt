🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Raised 9lb for easy h'cap chase debut win, different ground here, has won on heavy, chance
🔦 Spotlight: Hurdles winner took a big step forward when hacking up in his first novice handicap chase at Limerick (2m2f, good to yielding); up 9lb for that; trainer said afterwards he improved for the sounder surface so softer conditions are a worry, though his hurdles win came on heavy; considered.

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdler has proved to be a much better chaser; 2-3 in this sphere, winning a beginners' here over 2m4f and a handicap chase at Navan over 2m1f, both on soft ground; up 7lb for that latest win and moves up in grade but there could yet be more to come.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Leopardstown beginners' latest over 2m1f, obvious chance in first handicap chase
🔦 Spotlight: French hurdles winner off the mark at the second attempt in chases in a 2m1f Leopardstown beginners' on yielding last month, his main rival falling at the last; of obvious interest on handicap chase debut.
Horse quote: 2025-03-03 at Leopardstown (17f): "Golden Joy jumped very well, that will stand to him. Thurles the last day it may have happened a bit quick for him but still ran a nice race, coming here I thought I had a chance - Jordan Gainford, jockey, speaking to Racing TV  We'll probably go for a novice handicap chase, the 2m division is not always the strongest. I'd say the ground was a big key to Golden Joy here - Gordon Elliott. trainer, speaking to Racing TV"

💬 Comment: 2-12 in chases, remains 8lb above last win, poor over hurdles latest, more needed
🔦 Spotlight: 2-12 in chases; last won at Fairyhouse just over a year ago off 122; has generally struggled off his revised mark since and handicapper has been slow to relent; well beaten off lower hurdles rating latest; needs more.
Horse quote: 2024-03-31 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "Captains Nephew just didn't see out his race at Thurles the last day, I'd say the track was too quick for him. His form up to then has been mighty and this is the race I'd had in mind for him for a fair while - Philip Rothwell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won Clonmel beginners' on soft, behind Coming Up Easy latest, down 1lb, not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the second attempt over fences in a Clonmel beginners' in February (20.5f, soft); struggled in a Limerick novice handicap (2m2f, good to yielding) on latest behind Coming Up Easy; down 1lb and may do better returned to this easier ground; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2025-02-13 at Clonmel (20.5f): "My Gaffer promised a lot. We ran in in some big handicap hurdles and he was too small, he got crowded out. He's a brilliant little jumper and I would say some of those summer Nationals around the likes of Ballinrobe will be the races for him. He's a nice little horse - John Ryan, trainer"

💬 Comment: Won here over 2m4f in January, no impact up in trip-class since, this may be too sharp
🔦 Spotlight: Gained third win over fences here in January off 118 over 2m4f (yielding to soft); no impact upped in trip and class the last twice at Punchestown (3m3f) and Naas (3m1f); big drop in trip here may not be ideal.
Horse quote: 2024-01-28 at Naas (20f): "Kings Halo jumped and travelled, Danny got the fractions right. The drop back in trip made no difference. The ground and weigh suited him - James Dullea, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-10 over fences, last h'cap win off 15lb lower, big ask latest, may be on tough mark
🔦 Spotlight: 2-10 over fences, the last win coming last June in a Roscommon novice on good; won a handicap chase on yielding at Ballinrobe last May off 118; tough task on latest at Cheltenham; remains 15lb above last win so may need some respite from the handicapper.
Horse quote: 2024-05-07 at Ballinrobe (17f): "I've tried to sit Je T'ai Porte in a couple of times but she'd be fairly free and doing a bit too much the whole time, but she was grand in front here. I think the loose horse from the last helped her, she put in a good round of jumping and hopefully could win more - Shane Fitzgerald, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Tramore novice chase (15.5f, heavy) in January 2024 remains his only win in this sphere; out of form in three runs since return from a six month break; well-beaten off lower hurdles mark latest; hard to fancy on recent efforts, though he'll like the ground.

💬 Comment: Lost form since good run at Gowran, would prefer a sounder surface
🔦 Spotlight: 1-15 in chases; ran well at Gowran in November (2m, good) but badly out of sorts in three runs since, though faced a tough task at Cheltenham latest; would prefer better ground than this; eighth at Fairyhouse on Sunday.
Horse quote: 2022-05-02 at Down Royal (16.5f): "Gaelic Arc is a funny horse, difficult to train, and a horse you wouldn't have a punt on. He's going to be a lovely horse over a fence. The ground today probably suited him and was the key today. Niall Prendergast gave him a cracking ride and he'll go over fences now - John Ryan, trainer."
