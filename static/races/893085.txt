🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner, not a bad effort on latest off higher chase mark, likes it here, place chance
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile veteran is a former C&D winner; won a handicap chase at Ballinrobe last September but hasn't threatened to add to that tally over hurdles or fences since; not a terrible effort on latest and likes it here; place claims off lower hurdles mark.
Horse quote: 2023-10-12 at Tramore (15.5f): "The visor worked a treat today. Itsalonglongroad is an older horse and that is exactly what he needed. The lad who rode him the other day with a visor on said he ran away with him and I thought if he does that over 2 miles he mightn't get home but to be fair to him he jumped like a buck and kept going - Shane O'Callaghan, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flat winner, 1-20 over hurdles, 4lb below last win and ground versatile, may need the run
🔦 Spotlight: Dual purpose Flat winner; 1-20 over hurdles, the win coming at Sligo in August 2022 off 91; 4lb lower now, handles most ground and has run well here before but lacks a run and has a moderate record when fresh; others preferred.
Horse quote: 2019-05-10 at Cork (10f): "Today was genuinely only a fact-finding day. He's done a few pieces of work but we're only learning about him like everyone else. Colin said they went no gallop, which, in hindsight, wouldn't have suited him but he liked the ground, which is a positive. We thought at home that a mile and two furlongs is no problem to him, I'd say in time when we step him up into a higher grade of a race and they go a good honest gallop, that might suit him. He was honest today and we'll take the positives out of it. Fitness-wise he'll improve - we definitely haven't cooked him - and it was a good day out for him - Shane Lyons, assistant trainer of Red Striker"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-9 over timber, ran well here off 12lb higher in 2023 on soft, don't discount if it rains
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose maiden; 0-16 on the Flat and 0-9 over hurdles; pulled up at Gowran in October and beaten 45l on first run since at Clonmel last month; beaten just 5l here on soft in 2023 off 12lb higher so not completely dismissed, especially if there is rain.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Without a win since October 2021, losing run hasn't looked like ending recently
🔦 Spotlight: Old boy hasn't tasted success since October 2021; no sign of that barren spell coming to an end in recent runs; beaten 42l in a handicap chase on latest and 31l in last start over timber; hard to fancy.
