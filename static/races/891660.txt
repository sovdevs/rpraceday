🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed at Bath and sets a fair standard for the newcomers to target
🔦 Spotlight: Looks a bargain at £6,000 after making a winning start at Bath (5f, good to firm), coming home 2.5l clear despite getting behind early; could be useful and sets a fair standard for the newcomers to target.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Bath (5f): "Anthelia had been showing us she was a nice filly from early on in the year and we've been waiting to get a run into her. She's been straightforward and hopefully has a nice future. She's in a couple of sales races, and while it's very early in the season, she can't do any more than she did today in a race that had a few fancied types. We could look at the conditions race at Salisbury [May 4] or the Marygate at York [May 16] next -  Rod Millman, trainer"
