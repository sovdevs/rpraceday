🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has become frustrating but he's on a dangerous mark and this longer trip may suit
🔦 Spotlight: Underwhelming in the main last year and soundly beaten at Southwell three weeks ago; however, he may have needed that run after a three-month breaks and he continues to drop down the weights; has hinted on occasions that he may be suited by a staying trip and this course winner is not discounted.

💬 Comment: Lightly raced 5yo who is open to improvement now up in trip on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Always behind at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft) last time but it was a hot maiden and he previously kept on for a fair fifth at Chepstow (extended 2m3f, soft); made the frame in 3m points and this lightly raced 5yo is open to improvement now up in trip on handicap debut in a first-time tongue-tie; chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well treated on last winter's Catterick form but well below best on his three starts since
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Catterick (2m3f, soft) in December 2023 and runner-up there the next twice (2m3f, soft/heavy); well treated on that form but well below his best on his three starts since; revival needed now up in trip.

💬 Comment: Well handicapped on old Irish form but makes stable debut after very long absence
🔦 Spotlight: Hurdle/chase winner for Henry de Bromhead who is well handicapped on his best form; however, this 10yo has been absent since his £4,000 sale in September 2022 and is probably best watched on his stable debut.
