üí¨ Comment: Recent hurdles win augurs well although ground possibly on the quick side
üî¶ Spotlight: Not a great strike rate but beaten only a short head in 2023 Thyestes; started last season brightly with Troytown fourth but pulled up in three big handicaps afterwards; surprise winner on debut for üÜï new yard in 2m4f Navan handicap hurdle early this month, beating an in-form rival with plenty to spare on heavy; quicker ground possibly not ideal but stamina test should be fine and on a nice mark.
