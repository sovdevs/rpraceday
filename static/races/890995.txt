🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Up 22lb for wins at Naas and Clonmel, new trip and ground and ⬆️ up in class, can't dismiss
🔦 Spotlight: On a hat-trick after wins at Naas (2m, yielding) off 98 and Clonmel (17.5f, soft) off 109; up another 11lb now and pitched into a deeper race over a longer trip on different ground; a bit to prove but clearly in good heart and can't be totally dismissed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jumping errors have held him back over fences, unsure about this trip, others appeal more
🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard; 📈 progressive hurdler last season; jumping errors have held him back over the bigger obstacles so far, though he did put in a slightly better round of jumping on latest at Naas two weeks ago; not sure the step up to this trip will suit and others appeal more.

🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for yard and deserted by Blackmore; won a 4yo hurdle on final start in France; mild promise in first two novice chases then third in a novice handicap off this mark at Clonmel (16.5f, soft) last month; unproven over this far and probably best watched unless strong in the betting.

🔦 Spotlight: 1-7 over fences, the win coming in a Kilbeggan beginners' chase in May last year; has finished third the last twice but was well-beaten on both occasions; dropped another 1lb to 115 but needs more to feature in this.

🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for yard; Downpatrick maiden hurdle winner is 0-5 in this sphere; shaped okay in a couple of beginners' chases but no impact in two handicap chases, though he did scope dirty after the first one; can't be totally discounted in first time tongue tie given the form of his yard but others have stronger claims.

💬 Comment: 0-6 over fences but has run well in defeat, 3lb wrong but jockey claims 5lb, outrun odds
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winning hurdler is 0-6 in chases but has placed in five of those runs; proved no match for Hillsdale on latest but could get closer to that rival over this longer trip (placed over 24.5f over hurdles); his rider's 5lb claim negates the fact that he is 3lb out of the handicap; could go well at a price.
