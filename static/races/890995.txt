üí¨ Comment: Up 22lb for wins at Naas and Clonmel, new trip and ground and ‚¨ÜÔ∏è up in class, can't dismiss
üî¶ Spotlight: On a hat-trick after wins at Naas (2m, yielding) off 98 and Clonmel (17.5f, soft) off 109; up another 11lb now and pitched into a deeper race over a longer trip on different ground; a bit to prove but clearly in good heart and can't be totally dismissed.

üí¨ Comment: 2m4f maiden hurdle winner, best chase effort here on latest, interesting off 1lb higher
üî¶ Spotlight: 2m4f maiden hurdle winner in April 2023; 0-5 over fences but produced his best effort yet on latest at Naas in January (2m4f, soft); kept on nicely for second that day, is just 1lb higher now and he ran well in a 3m1f handicap hurdle at this venue in December 2023; interesting.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: 0-6 over fences but has run well in defeat, 3lb wrong but jockey claims 5lb, outrun odds
üî¶ Spotlight: Three-time winning hurdler is 0-6 in chases but has placed in five of those runs; proved no match for Hillsdale on latest but could get closer to that rival over this longer trip (placed over 24.5f over hurdles); his rider's 5lb claim negates the fact that he is 3lb out of the handicap; could go well at a price.
