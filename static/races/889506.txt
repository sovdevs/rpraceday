🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has only raced ten times in almost four years, but the ability remains; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Has only raced ten times (one win) despite making his debut in May 2021 and has always been with this stable; was returning from 709 days off when fourth of eight at Kempton (7f, Polytrack) 19 days ago, which suggests that the ability remains; interesting provided this doesn't come too soon.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner, but just 1-32 and he may need a stiffer test than this now
🔦 Spotlight: Sole success in 32 starts came over C&D as a 3yo; has a good record fresh so the 131-day absence isn't an issue, but quite apart from his unappealing strike-rate he may need a stiffer test than this now.

🔦 Spotlight: 3-11 for Charlie Johnston and 1lb lower than for her latest success at Newcastle (7f, Tapeta; first-time blinkers) in November; tailed off minus the headgear on stable debut back there (1m; first start since wind surgery) 12 days ago, which leaves her with enough to prove; blinkers are still missing.
