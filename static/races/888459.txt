🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Slow starts are an issue but he's lightly raced and will be dangerous if breaking on terms
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo; lost all chance when blowing the start on last month's handicap debut and was again slowly away before keeping on well for second at Kempton (6f) three weeks later; comes with obvious risk attached but will be a danger to all if he breaks on terms today.
