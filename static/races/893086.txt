🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed on handicap debut at Wexford last summer; runs over this trip here on Sunday
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well in course maiden last summer and placed on handicap debut over 3m at Wexford next time; down the field over 2m on last month's return to action; well-backed favourite when winning decisively over this trip here on Sunday; 7lb penalty if turning out again.
Horse quote: 2025-04-13 at Tramore (21.5f): "That was lovely. Stumblin In was in season when third at Wexford last year and we probably shouldn't have brought her to Downpatrick then. She is owned by Michael Fanning who is a neighbour of mine and I'm delighted for him - Pat Doyle, trainer."
