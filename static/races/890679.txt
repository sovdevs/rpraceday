🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improving having gone 3-3 since joining Hugo Palmer; hosed up in a trial for this
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winning hurdler but an improving Flat performer having gone 3-3 since joining Hugo Palmer and it was all very straightforward in a trial for this at Lingfield; could easily deal with the 8lb rise and has winning form here.
Horse quote: 2025-02-28 at Lingfield (AW) (16f): "Roaring Legend is really improving. He's taken a massive step forward since winning at Newcastle last time and Hugo is delighted with him. He got into a nice, even rhythm and I went forward going down the hill. He lengthened well and he's got a big engine. He gave me a nice feel and could progress into a Cup horse - David Probert, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Record of 4-12; admirably consistent on the AW and made it 3-4 on Tapeta when winning unchallenged from Plage De Havre over 1m6f at Wolverhampton last month; fair to say he got the run of things that day under a positive ride but, off just 4lb higher, he's not easily knocked; stays 2m.

💬 Comment: Prevailed in a steadily-run 1m6f race last time; hasn't excelled over 2m in the past
🔦 Spotlight: Has only won on Tapeta and had the best turn of foot in a steadily-run race last time at Wolverhampton (1m6f); just a worry that he's not excelled over 2m in the past.
Horse quote: 2025-02-11 at Wolverhampton (AW) (14f): "I think two miles last time just stretched Heathen. He seems to be a horse who runs well fresh. He's quite delicate to handle and Dave [O'Meara, trainer] does a great job with horses like him. It all went smoothly, I was a bit worried about lack of pace but, even when the raced turned into a sprint, he could still travel into it well - Jason Watson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Failed to kick on over hurdles and has finished behind some of today's opposition in his last two races; up against it.
Horse quote: 2023-09-09 at Kempton (AW) (16f): "Circuit Breaker had a really tough trip at Hamilton last time and it was all too much for him. I had to leave him alone after that and, with the size of his feet, he wants a bit of juice in the ground. He might be one for the final of this series and I'm glad I've got him back on track - Ralph Beckett, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Enhanced his excellent record here with an all-the-way 2l success over 1m2f 20 days ago, under Lauren Young claiming the 7lb; his form at 2m leaves a bit to be desired but from fairly limited evidence, and horses from this yard are renowned for their versatility trip-wise.
Horse quote: 2025-01-11 at Newcastle (AW) (10f): "Midnight Lion loves it round here and is thriving at the minute. He's very straightforward - he wings the gates, he doesn't pull in front and when you get stuck into him he really keeps finding - Paul Mulrennan, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
