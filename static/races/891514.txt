💬 Comment: Again missed the kick but finished well for 3rd at Lingfield; that form franked this week
🔦 Spotlight: Completely blew the start when tailed off on Newbury debut (1m) and wasn't the best away second time out at Lingfield (1m2f AW), though he stayed on well to finish under 4l off Sea Scout who won a Listed race at Epsom this week; a gelding operation could be the making of him; respected.

💬 Comment: 360,000gns yearling who never raced for Sir Michael Stoute; nicely bred
🔦 Spotlight: 360,000gns yearling who never raced for Sir Michael Stoute; nicely bred, being a brother to four winners including smart 7f-1m4f performer King Of Conquest; dam a 1m2f Listed winner; makes sense to check the market.

💬 Comment: First foal; dam tailed off in a bumper; wouldn't be the obvious answer
🔦 Spotlight: First foal; dam tailed off in a bumper and half-sister to winners Grand Canyon (1m1f/1m2f Flat and 2m hurdle) and Alquimia (7f/1m); wouldn't be the obvious answer to a race of this nature; stablemate Serenity Blue is far more appealing on paper.
