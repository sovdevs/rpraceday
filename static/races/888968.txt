🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual hurdle winner and made a bright start to life over fences; Townend keeps the faith
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who has made a bright start to life over fences, finishing runner-up in a Grade 2 novice at Limerick in December before a 3l defeat in a mares' beginners' at Fairyhouse last month behind two stablemates; Paul Townend keeps the faith over stablemate Karia Des Blaises who was half a length in front of her; should be firmly in the mix.

🔦 Spotlight: Has improved plenty over fences this campaign, shaping with promise in a Grade 2 at Cork on chase debut and has hit the crossbar twice since, including when finishing just in front of stablemate Paggane earlier this month; should improve when she settles better and may be capable of confirming the form with Paggane on the same terms.
