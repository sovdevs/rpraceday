💬 Comment: Came good over hurdles last month and followed up on chasing debut; upped in trip today
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage mare who won over hurdles last month, after a break, and kept on too strongly for odds-on favourite on chasing debut at Plumpton (2m3f, good) a fortnight ago; moves up in trip today and could easily have a lot more to offer over fences.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In the frame in all five chases this year; likely contender once again
🔦 Spotlight: In the frame five consecutive times since switched to chasing this year, most notably when winning by 18l in first-time cheekpieces at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in January; should also be suited by today's trip-and-ground combination; likely contender again.
Horse quote: 2024-02-18 at Musselburgh (20f): "That was really good and a step back in the right direction. Micks Jet did everything well and nicely so hopefully it's onwards and upwards this season. She looked as good as she was last season so we're pleased with her. She's not an easy mare [to train]. Her jumping was a bit sloppy to start with and I think she's just come to herself, she's more of a spring mare. She's qualified for the [Herring Queen Series] final at Kelso so that might be something and the owners would like to go to the mares' meeting at Cheltenham. We could look at something good in between - Philip Kirby, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Four-time course winner over hurdles; on the downgrade now and has 0-9 strike-rate over fences but lost out only by a neck at Wetherby (3m, good) last month and is sure to be suited by the return to this track.
Horse quote: 2023-05-12 at Market Rasen (23f): "Giovanni Change is just the most genuine horse you are ever going to see. He has only got one eye, that is his fifth win now, his fourth at Market Rasen. He just won on the Flat at Ponterfract, what more can you ask for- Neil Readman, co-owner, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second off this mark at Plumpton two runs ago and didn't run badly in a marathon last time
🔦 Spotlight: Probably best known for his Plumpton exploits but should be fine on this right-handed track; runner-up off today's mark at Plumpton (3m1f, soft) in January and didn't run badly over a marathon trip there the following month; versatile regarding ground; no surprise if he features.
Horse quote: 2024-01-29 at Plumpton (25.5f): "I had to take a pull on Morfee early doors as I hit the front on him soon enough last time - James Best, jockey."
