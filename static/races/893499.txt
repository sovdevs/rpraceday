🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Career-best under a big weight in the Irish Lincoln; trip a bit short but a major player
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice last year including a 1m1f handicap at this track; later finished a fine fourth in a 1m2f Listed race; returned to action with a career-best effort under a big weight in the Irish Lincoln; this trip might be a bit short but is still a major player.
Horse quote: 2024-10-06 at Tipperary (9f): "Kortez Bay is learning and strengthening up all the time. He is starting to do everything right but I think there is still a lot of improvement in him. Gary thinks he will get 1m4f in time - Sheila Lavery, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fourth in Listed race (6f) penultimate start; this trip fine but has to repeat that form
🔦 Spotlight: Dual turf winner showed improved form last term when a close fourth in Listed company (6f) penultimate start; this trip is fine but needs to repeat that form on return.
Horse quote: 2024-06-16 at Gowran Park (7f): "Elinor Dashwood was very free at Naas and I decided to put her asleep at the Curragh the last day. We learned a lot from her there over six furlongs with the way she came home. I said to Ronan to put her asleep again and ride her cold, which he did, and she relaxed really well and looks a million dollars. She quickened twice. She quickened to get to them and quickened to go away from them. It was a class ride. She'll get further and she might go for the big fillies' handicap at the Curragh. If not, we could look at Galway - Adrian McGuinness, trainer."
