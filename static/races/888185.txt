🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-3 and barely tested in a bumper and two hurdle starts; huge chance despite 12lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: The winner of all three starts, unextended in a Tramore bumper (2m, good) on debut and landing a maiden hurdle there on New Year's Day (2m1f, heavy); never off the bridle when sauntering to success at Carlisle five weeks ago (2m1f, soft); bred to stay this longer trip and he looks to have been found a golden opportunity to maintain his perfect record.

🔦 Spotlight: Pleasing start to his rules career when third of 13 at Newbury in January (2m, soft) but neither subsequent run has been comparable; receives 12lb from More Coko and he'll be a danger if returning to the Newbury form.
