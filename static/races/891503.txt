🔦 Spotlight: Much more experienced than most of these; won at Newcastle (7f) in January and the longer trip might have been against him last time (both runs over 1m have been poor); not ruled out if proving as effective on turf (wasn't last season for a different stable).

🔦 Spotlight: Well held first two starts last year (stiff task on second of them) but showed improvement when third of ten at Beverley (5f, good; wore tongue-strap) on final run, best work late on; subsequently left Craig Lidster (same owners); bred to stay this longer trip and still has untapped potential.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked tricky at Beverley on return and now has something to prove in hood/cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Hinted at ability in three novices last term but looked very tricky in handicap at Beverley on reappearance, tailed off after pulling hard and hanging left; perhaps he was unsuited by the right-hand bend but he now has something to prove in a hood and cheekpieces.

💬 Comment: Has shown little since two seconds last term; needs blinkers to have a galvanising effect
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up over 6f/7f at Yarmouth (good to firm) last summer but she has shown little since, last of ten on seasonal debut; requires the first-time blinkers to have a galvanising effect.
