🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good effort in a higher grade last time; fair shout provided he doesn't need the run
🔦 Spotlight: A length winner at Southwell in October (2m, good) and ran quite well off this 6lb higher mark at Wetherby; that was in a higher grade so likely to feature provided he doesn't need the run.

🔦 Spotlight: Goes well for Fern O'Brien, under whom he made all for a comfortable success at Fakenham just before Christmas (2m, good to soft); this looks tougher off a 5lb higher mark and record after a break isn't overly encouraging.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner on a useful mark and it was a good handicap he ran in last time at Taunton
🔦 Spotlight: Won over C&D in early 2024 off just 2lb lower, following up a win at Wincanton; some of this season's efforts read well and it was a good handicap he ran in last time at Taunton.
Horse quote: 2022-09-26 at Roscommon (15.5f): "Black Hawk Eagle did it well enough in the end. I got left in front plenty early enough but he jumped well. I was very happy with him - Simon Torrens, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chequered record over fences continues last time but generally reliable over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Risky proposition over fences (twice ran out) but was running well when jinking and unseating his rider last time at Kempton; that was after three solid runs in handicap hurdles at Ascot and he's generally better behaved in this discipline.
Horse quote: 2024-10-27 at Aintree (16f): "Maybe it was because Moveit Like Minnie was in front, but he just ran out. He didn't give me much warning. I was down the inner and he ran out on the outside, so he's gone the whole way across the fence. I felt I had the winner covered, but I'm not going to say I definitely would have won because nobody knows. For the horse to do what he did probably means he had plenty left in the tank - Tom Bellamy, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Won off a much reduced mark at Exeter (2m, good) in November but wasn't as good when third at Huntingdon and then finished tailed off at Cheltenham; will need to return from his break in top order, being 4lb above that last winning mark.
Horse quote: 2023-11-29 at Hereford (19.5f): "Magic Seven loves it around here, that's his third win at Hereford. I think he likes that good ground as well. He won well but it wasn't a great race. His jumping is getting a little bit better and he seems to be going the right way. We'll look for something stronger next - Jonjo O'Neill, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A Newton Abbot specialist who was tailed off at Taunton after a lengthy break
🔦 Spotlight: A Newton Abbot specialist (all seven hurdle wins there) who was tailed off at Taunton after a lengthy break; an 11yo now and others are readily preferred.
Horse quote: 2024-06-05 at Newton Abbot (17f): "Clearance is absolutely incredible here. He's got so much speed, and Tom [Cannon] rides him with such confidence because of that. He beat a fresh four-year-old as well. I'm not sure when the next race here is but he'll be back - Michael Blake, trainer."
