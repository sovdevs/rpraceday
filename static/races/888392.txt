🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a hat-trick; beat Brian The Snail by a head last time; up only 2lb and not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Useful in his prime; had fallen steadily in the weights prior to scoring at Lingfield (awarded race after Hierarchy weighed in light) in January and over C&D (by a head from Brian The Snail) last month; up only 2lb from last time and not dismissed lightly.

🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-16 on AW but has been knocking at the door for quite some time; disqualified after jockey weighed in light in January, runner-up next three starts and had an excuse when only fifth to Whenthedealinsdone over C&D last time; deserves a win but a high draw is not ideal.
