🔦 Spotlight: Turned things around when battling well to score under Freddie Gordon in a conditional jockeys' handicap at Plumpton (3m1f, soft) ten days ago; didn't have much in hand but he's 3lb well in off the same mark here and has won over C&D in the past; key player.

💬 Comment: Made low-key start for 🆕 new yard last month but he's in the mix on his best Irish form
🔦 Spotlight: Eight-race maiden who made a low-key start for his 🆕 new yard at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) last month but that was after a break; should benefit from that run and he ran some promising races in Ireland last summer, including when third at Wexford (3m, good); not ruled out back up in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Veteran who is 1-15 in points and 0-6 over hurdles; others are more convincing
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who is 1-15 in points and made it 0-6 over hurdles when a remote sixth in Fontwell handicap (2m5f, soft) last month; may have needed that after an absence but he has a mixed record in this sphere and others are more convincing.
