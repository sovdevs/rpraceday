🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of a bumper/hurdle winner; stable has relatively modest bumper strike-rate
🔦 Spotlight: Sixth foal; half-sister to 9.4f AW winner Black Hole Sun (RPR 56); dam bumper/hurdle winner, from family of good staying jumpers Alexander Banquet and Silver Birch; stable has relatively modest strike-rate in bumpers but market support will bring this filly into the equation.
