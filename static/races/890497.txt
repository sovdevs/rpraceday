🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Juvenile hurdler who scored in Musselburgh handicap last time; may progress further
🔦 Spotlight: Juvenile hurdler who scored against his own age-group in Musselburgh handicap most recently, taking record under this code to 2-4; sole start at Ayr resulted in one of his Flat wins; 🎖️ major contender with further progress plausible.
Horse quote: 2025-03-21 at Musselburgh (17.5f): "It's been a real team effort to get Inappropriate here. This has been the plan for a while - his first run was excellent then we felt his subsequent two runs were ground-related and we needed to wait for better going so this race was the obvious one.  But we've had two scares. He stood on a nail with a hind foot and took a while to get over that. Then more recently he got cast and bashed a front leg and back leg. The vets and all the staff have been working so hard, he's been standing in buckets of ice for hours, and they've got him here. There was a worry for a time he wouldn't make it. It's worked out really well - Jedd O'Keeffe, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Dual Listed winner as a juvenile hurdler last term and has consistent handicap form this term, beaten only 2l at Taunton most recently; respected off a reduced mark (8lb lower than first handicap attempt).
Horse quote: 2023-12-09 at Aintree (17f): "Liari is a gorgeous horse. He came from France where he did okay on the Flat. He's improved since his last run and will keep improving. He'll have an entry in the Triumph, but there are plenty of other races in the spring - back here might suit him. He's a lovely horse for the future and needs looking after - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Posted a career-best performance in series final at Musselburgh three weeks ago on only his second handicap attempt; may improve further on the back of that clearcut win; shortlisted.
Horse quote: 2025-03-21 at Musselburgh (17.5f): "It was a brilliant ride by Alan. He had it all planned beforehand what he was going to do and when he jumped the second-last I thought there was no way he was going to get beaten. Kingston James definitely stays but I think dropping him back to two miles is the right thing for him round here because they need to be able to stay - Lucinda Russell, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-12-27 at Wetherby (16f): "I'd say Maghlaak is going to be a decent horse, jumping will toughen him up. His bit of class showed there late on and he did that well.

Horse quote: 2024-04-20 at Bangor-on-Dee (17.5f): "Lipa K always ran well for his previous yard and we were lucky to get him pretty much ready to go. He jumped really well at home and while he was a little ponderous over his fences today I don't think he enjoyed the soft patches of ground. He actually did it a shade cosily at the end - Oliver Greenall, joint trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Far from solid on his form since returned to hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Productive on the Flat last year but is far from solid on his form since returned to hurdles; best watched on return from 100-day layoff, unless the betting suggests otherwise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ordinary handicapper on Flat; not seen over hurdles since 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Has won over hurdles but not seen in this sphere since 2023; has subsequently remained an ordinary handicapper on the Flat; appears to face a difficult task at this level.
Horse quote: 2023-05-23 at Huntingdon (16f): "I didn't want to hit the front too soon on Sisterandbrother as he was keen early and he picked them up well. I don't know how strong the race was but it was only his second run over hurdles so he could be a fun summer horse - Harry Cobden, jockey."
