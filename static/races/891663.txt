🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten fav but ran to a good level on sole 2yo run (1m, soft); open to lots of improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Fine pedigree and he was sent off the 8-11 favourite for his Nottingham debut last October (1m, soft), drawing clear of the third but finding the ill-fated Falconer too strong; the pair were well clear and the fourth has recorded an RPR of 90 when winning since; open to improvement this year and, while this will be a different test, he holds strong claims.

🔦 Spotlight: Overcame a wide draw to make a winning debut at Wolverhampton (7f) in October; failed to quicken in a conditions event at Newmarket on last month's reappearance (7f, good); can leave that behind but he has to concede 7lb to a promising opponent.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Debut effort (7f, AW) offered hope of better but significant progress will be required
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to five winners and although he ran to just a modest level on his Wolverhampton debut (7f; 80-1) in December, the run did offer hope for the future; stiff task here though.
