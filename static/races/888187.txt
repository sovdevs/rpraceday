💬 Comment: Form in handicaps for this yard reads 3111; hard to know how much he has left to give
🔦 Spotlight: Has taken off since switched to handicaps and joining this yard (form 3111), defying a nine-month absence at Leicester (2m, heavy) in December (second, third and sixth have won since); up another 7lb and drying ground is an unknown, but it's hard to know how much he still has left to give.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins on soft ground during the past year, the latest a narrow success over a subsequent winner at Carlisle (2m1f) last month; up another 4lb and drying ground a potential question mark, though he won twice on fast ground on the Flat; blinkers given a go and he's respected for last year's winning stable.

🔦 Spotlight: Back off the same mark as when narrowly making a successful return from seven months off at Wetherby in October, but his efforts in the meantime raise doubts as to whether he can capitalise; hood in which he gained both hurdle wins is still missing; stable looks to hold stronger claims with Hara Kiri.

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful on Flat (RPR 89) and looked a nice prospect for hurdles early last year, including an easy win at Catterick (2m, soft); not really convinced in two starts at Hereford (2m4f, good to soft) since returning to this sphere in December (behind Klic Boum last time); may be best watched for now.
