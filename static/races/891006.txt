🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Too free and didn't get home over 2m4f here at Christmas; this looks a lot easier
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced mare who won twice in France on heavy ground; it was a good race in which she was ultimately well held over 2m4f here on stable debut and she raced freely after seven months off; now returns from another three months away but won't mind this sharper test and clearly retains potential for her top team.

💬 Comment: Stone inferior to Jalila Moriviere on official ratings but she boasts the superior RPRs
🔦 Spotlight: Rated a stone inferior to Jalila Moriviere on official ratings but she boasts the superior RPRs; ran really well behind the smart Aurora Vega at Fairyhouse on New Year's Day and for whatever reason didn't give her true running behind the same horse in a Grade 3 last time; every chance if back to her best.
