🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 1 winner at Fairyhouse last season; prep for Mares' Hurdle; will take some beating
🔦 Spotlight: Classy mare's only defeat from four starts for Willie Mullins was when fourth to Golden Ace in Mares' Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham last March; relished step back up in trip when dominant winner of Grade 1 Mares' Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse (2m4f, heavy); this is her prep for the Mares' Hurdle and she should take beating on her return.
