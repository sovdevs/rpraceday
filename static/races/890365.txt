🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed; shaped nicely on latest start; interesting if handling surface on turf debut
🔦 Spotlight: Looked useful prospect when winning both starts at Newcastle (6f) in 2023 and she ran her best race since when a staying-on fifth over 5f there three weeks ago; still has untapped potential and should be suited by this step back up in distance; interesting if handling the surface on turf debut.
Horse quote: 2023-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (6f): "She's always been held in high regard, but her mind sometimes wants to do other things. Filly One isn't the easiest, so it was nice for her to back it up - Harry Russell, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-07-17 at Thirsk (5f): "Ingleby Archie was getting warm in the saddling boxes and while it was humid in there I admitted to the owner it was a bit of a worry. On last year's form he looks quite well handicapped but it took a couple of runs to get going - Adrain Nicholls, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-11-02 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "Muscika is a lovely old boy. The last day at Epsom went really well and today went the same, he jumped out and has a nice gate speed, which is good from a low draw here. We went a nice enough gallop but I didn't have to use too much petrol and he travelled into it well. He's really found his form again - Cieren Fallon, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2023-08-19 at Ripon (6f): "I was a bit shocked, but Roundhay Park does turn up every time and tries his heart out. It's lovely getting on such genuine horses. I was doing a rain dance last night as he does like it with a bit of soft in the ground. He's so genuine and kept on finding - Faye McManoman, jockey."
