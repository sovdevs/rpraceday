🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner last March; three solid runs since returned to the AW in November but he's edged up the weights for his latest C&D second and could prove vulnerable for win purposes.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy C&D win a year ago; in and out afterwards but appeals as the type to progress in 2025
🔦 Spotlight: Odds-on favourite for handicap debut over C&D one year ago and won easily; added a Haydock handicap last July and he didn't run badly at Chester when last seen in September; could still have handicapping scope and he's interesting.
