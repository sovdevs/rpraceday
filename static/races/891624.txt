🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced gelding who has shown useful handicap form since dropped to 7f, winning on the other track here last August then close second over C&D on reappearance; 🚀 open to further improvement; respected.
Horse quote: 2024-04-23 at Yarmouth (8f): "That was a slight surprise. Fifty Nifty has worked nicely at home but I wasn't expecting him to go away and win like that. He's a really exciting prospect and fingers crossed we can have a lovely time with him this season - Tom Clover, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Useful filly; behind Fifty Nifty on reappearance but is likely to improve on that effort
🔦 Spotlight: Useful filly whose 2024 form featured good efforts at two major summer festivals; finished 3l behind Fifty Nifty here on reappearance but is likely to do better with that outing under her belt; in the mix.
Horse quote: 2023-09-08 at Ascot (6f): "Miss Information ran good races on her last two starts and we thought this stiffer track might suit her. She's done that really nicely and she's got a smashing temperament. She's not the biggest, but has a big heart and a really good way of galloping. I'll speak to owners about plans, but she could run again this season - Andrew Balding, trainer."

💬 Comment: Shaped well on stable debut; disappointing here last time but is hard to write off
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped well at Doncaster on stable/seasonal debut; below-par favourite at this course since but is hard to write off; defied a 2lb higher mark at the Galway Festival during his spell in Ireland last year.
Horse quote: 2024-08-04 at Galway (7f): "Physique is a horse who likes to get on with things and there is only one way to ride him. He can get quite wound up if you try to hold him back. Seamie knows him and knew what to do after riding him the last couple of times - Micky Fenton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart on his day but finished behind two of these rivals in C&D handicap most recently
🔦 Spotlight: Smart 7f performer on his day; went close last August when bidding for a second Hungerford win; well treated on that sort of form but was nowhere near it in C&D handicap (behind two of these rivals) on reappearance.
Horse quote: 2023-06-10 at Haydock (7f): "Seven furlongs is the right trip, but it's the hardest trip to find and Jumby also doesn't want soft ground, so we have to just pick our way through. He's a brilliant horse who is very good in Group 3s, he's won a Group 2 and there's no reason why he couldn't win another one. He'd have to carry a lot of weight in the Wokingham, but when you see the size of him I don't think weight bothers him very much, so we'll see - Eve Johnson Houghton, trainer."
