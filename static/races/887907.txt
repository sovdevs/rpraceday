🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual point winner; went close over timber and 2nd at Down Royal in Dec'; unseated since
🔦 Spotlight: Dual point winner who went close over timber and came on from his chase debut at Cork when beaten a head in a beginners' at Down Royal on St Stephen's Day; was beaten when unseating at Punchestown since but he is the type to bounce back.

💬 Comment: Promise start to chasing with Tramore 3rd; unseated early since before good hurdle run
🔦 Spotlight: Promising start to life over fences when beaten 4l in a beginners' at Tramore, form that worked out okay; however, made a bad early error before unseating at Cork last month; back to form over timber since but needs a career best now tackling beginners' company again.

💬 Comment: Dual point winner; went close over timber and 2nd at Down Royal in Dec'; unseated since
🔦 Spotlight: Dual point winner who went close over timber and came on from his chase debut at Cork when beaten a head in a beginners' at Down Royal on St Stephen's Day; was beaten when unseating at Punchestown since but he is the type to bounce back.
