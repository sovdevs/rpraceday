💬 Comment: Not firing on all cylinders since returning from long absence in the autumn (four runs)
🔦 Spotlight: Useful in his prime but has not been firing on all cylinders since returning from long layoff in the autumn (four runs); continues to slide down the weights but it's probably wise to wait for some encouraging signals from the betting.
