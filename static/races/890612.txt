💬 Comment: Lightly raced maiden who has to be of interest on chasing/handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Six-race maiden but was placed in a Listed hurdle early last season and shaped encouragingly in a good race on his reappearance; disappointing when only 13-8 for a maiden hurdle last time (after wind surgery) but reportedly bled from the nose; has something to prove on ground this dry but has to be of interest on chasing/handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The handicapper is doing his bit for the cause but others appeal more
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner in Ireland; beaten between 11l and 17l in four handicap chases for his current yard and was no better for cheekpieces last time; the handicapper is doing his bit for the cause but others appeal more.
Horse quote: 2023-11-26 at Cork (16f): "Tactical Affair is a lovely horse and he will come on a lot. He's a fine big horse and only coming into himself - Jordan Gainford, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconsistent but contender if following one good run with another; cheekpieces are new
🔦 Spotlight: Worryingly inconsistent but has won over fences (1-6) and he steadied the ship with a second at Southwell a month ago (2m, good to soft); won't be far away with a repeat of that and the cheekpieces are new.
Horse quote: 2024-11-15 at Southwell (16f): "Jolyjump has always looked a nice horse and his jumping was super - Caoilin Quinn, rider."
