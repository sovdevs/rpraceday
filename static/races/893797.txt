🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Appreciated the switch to turf and new trip when C&D winner latest; up 6lb; can improve
🔦 Spotlight: Modest qualifying form over 5f but bred to do better, being out of triple Group winner at up to about 1m1f; no great shakes on AW handicap debut but he appreciated the switch to turf and new trip when winning over C&D latest; up 6lb but still on a low mark; strong chance.

💬 Comment: Returns from fruitless hurdling spell but capable of good run if that hasn't left a mark
🔦 Spotlight: Comes into it on Lingfield turf win (1m1f, good) last May and he subsequently ran well over C&D; very capable of going well if a fruitless spell over hurdles hasn't taken the edge off him; cheekpieces refitted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising handicap debut on AW (1m2f); not so good since; fitting tongue-tie could help
🔦 Spotlight: Promising handicap debut at Lingfield (1m2f, AW) when a hampered close third but he failed to find much over the trip at Brighton before failing to stay the extended 1m3f at Bath last month; still has potential if fitting a tongue-tie helps.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Brighton wins (1m4f and 1m2f) in 2024; never sighted there on return; other days
🔦 Spotlight: Kept to downhill tracks on turf in 2024, winning twice at Brighton (1m4f and 1m2f; good to firm and good); never sighted on his recent reappearance there and likely to be other days.
Horse quote: 2024-08-20 at Brighton (12f): "Fighting Poet doesn't wear blinkers for fashion purposes and things had to go right, but he's got the talent to run well. After his last run, he seems to be improving a little bit recently and we've changed his training regime a little bit. Leah [Brundle], who looks after him, has done a great job. They're a great couple and I'm delighted for them. I'm also delighted for the Adlestrop Club. They are wonderfully enthusiastic people and we've had some fun over the years and it's nice to finally get his head in front for them - Trainer Richard Phillips, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Two of four wins came over C&D but he missed all of 2023 and it's proving a long road back for this yard; up against it.
Horse quote: 2022-04-23 at Haydock (10f): "Glen Esk is a big unit and he's strengthened up a bit from last year. As he's a big horse I thought he might need the race and hopefully we can build on that through the year. There might be a nice little race to win with him further down the line - winning trainer Chris Wall."
