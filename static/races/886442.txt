🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In-form 8yo who won at Kempton before a good second at Lingfield; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Ended a losing run when making most at Kempton (6f) last month and he ran another good race when runner-up at Lingfield two weeks ago; now goes back up in grade but he remains well treated on old form and is tactically versatile; key player.
