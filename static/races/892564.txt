🔦 Spotlight: Three-time hurdle winner ran respectably off 1lb higher in handicaps when last seen, beaten 7l; was second in this race last year on seasonal debut; good ground suits so one to consider.
Horse quote: 2023-09-16 at Navan (15.5f): "First Dare had been hitting the crossbar and we were wondering would it ever happen. She got a beautiful ride and these races are determined by the experienced riders. It's great to get a win out of her and a little Flat race is not out of the question further down the line - Liz Doyle, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-08-18 at Tramore (16.5f): "Mater Matuta loves it here. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the seaside air as she's used to that at home. We'll probably head to Bellewstown in a fortnight's time for another handicap hurdle - Alan Delany, trainer's assistant."
