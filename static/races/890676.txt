🔦 Spotlight: Doubled his tally on his 28th start at Chelmsford (1m2f, Polytrack) 15 days ago; still lower than for his other win despite a 4lb rise, but he remains unproven over this far and isn't favoured by the draw; stable also runs Buxted Too.

💬 Comment: Dual winner around here and beat a big field at Doncaster last time; not opposed lightly
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner here (1m2f/1m5f) and he beat 18 rivals in a Doncaster apprentice event (1m2f, good to soft) under Mason Paetel last time; bit more needed from 5lb higher, but he isn't opposed lightly.
Horse quote: 2024-04-21 at Musselburgh (12.5f): "Destinado is a very tough horse who's been very consistent since he joined James. This is his trip, he broke well and travelled nicely throughout the race - Aidan Keeley, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-07-29 at Southwell (AW) (14f): "The way Sun Dancer Girl won at Lingfield last time filled me and the boss up with confidence that she would see the mile and six out. She's one of the first horses Nick had in with us and she's our first winner for him. She's a progressive filly - Callum Hutchinson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-03-13 at Kempton (AW) (12f): "Tony [Carroll, trainer] said to take my time as Tortured Soul is an easy ride and to ride him with confidence as he's the best horse in the race. The key for him is getting him to relax and when they sprinted into the straight I knew I had plenty of horse to coax and to get there as late as possible. He's done it well and is racking up a few wins - Neil Callan, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2023-01-21 at Lingfield (AW) (10f): "Obsidian Knight has won round here three times now but I wouldn't say he has to come here. What he needs is a proper gallop, and he got one today. We're looking forward to running him on the turf, but whether we give him a break or go for one of the bonuses, I'll speak to the owners and see what they want to do. He seems to handle the track lovely and Tom gave him an absolutely perfect ride - Terry Kent, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has enjoyed a fine 2025, but more is needed to defy this mark and drawn wider than ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Won six of his first seven starts of 2025 (including one over C&D), his last win coming off a 26lb higher mark than the first; should appreciate the return to this trip, but more is needed to defy this mark and is drawn wider than ideal.

💬 Comment: Found to have bled when tailed off at Wolverhampton last time; something to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Still just 1lb above his last winning mark, but was found to have bled when tailed off at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) last time; something to prove after that.
Horse quote: 2025-01-30 at Southwell (AW) (12f): "Charlie's Choice is ultra consistent and seems to like it here too. There wasn't much pace and we were able just to roll forward and get a position. He's a very willing partner and battled back well - Kieran Shoemark, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner but losing run up to 30; will do well to break his losing run in this
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a five-timer between November 2021 and May 2022 including two wins over C&D, but 0-30 since; will do well to break his losing run under top weight in this field.
Horse quote: 2022-05-13 at Newbury (12f): "Way Of Life is just growing up. He was so raw and ignorant and gormless as a younger horse and if he had ability he kept it well hidden, but we knew something was there. I hope he doesn't get crucified for that by the handicapper - Jonathan Portman, trainer."
