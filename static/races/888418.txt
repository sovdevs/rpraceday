🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tame effort at Kempton on debut but sent off the 1-2 fav; could leave that run well behind
🔦 Spotlight: Raced freely and caught wide on his Kempton debut three weeks ago (7f), weakening tamely in the closing stages; wouldn't normally be of major interest on the back of that but the fact he was sent off the long odds-on favourite was notable; could prove a different propositon with the run behind him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Half-brother to three winners; stable in fine form; betting can guide
🔦 Spotlight: Fifth foal; half-brother to winners Goal Exceeded (6f 2yo; RPR 85), Galaxy Gazer (6f AW 2yo; 76) and Raabeh (5f AW; 65); dam placed 7f AW (66); form of the stable could hardly be better but their newcomers are often better for a run.
