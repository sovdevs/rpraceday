🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third on handicap debut at Newcastle last time and form has been boosted; tongue-tie on
🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in her first three starts (much too keen in the first two), but much better when third of seven on handicap debut at Newcastle (5f, Tapeta) four weeks ago; subsequent wins by the first and second (twice) give the form substance and she is a major player down 1lb with a tongue-tie given a go.
