🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His recent course wins have been over 7f but he's versatile trip-wise; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Won here on March 22 when dropped back to 7f and he followed up over the same trip 12 days ago, for course win number nine; up in grade and back up in distance today, but he's versatile trip-wise and this in-form course specialist could have another major say.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten over hurdles early this year and same story over C&D on recent stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Useful on the Flat and over hurdles in 2022; however, he struggled on two hurdle starts earlier this year and was well beaten back on the Flat over C&D on stable debut three weeks ago; lots to prove.
