🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won on fast ground and drops into a 0-55 for the first time; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Best known as an AW performer (9-65) and rarely seen on turf (2-18) these days; however, his two wins on grass came on good/good to firm and he drops into a 0-55 for the first time; interesting for stable that also runs Mudlahhim.
Horse quote: 2019-05-14 at Chepstow (8f): "Light Up Our Stars ran a grand race at Newbury on his seasonal comeback on very soft ground and the quick conditions here have helped him. We will have to see how the handicapper looks at the result before making a little plan - Richard Hughes, trainer."

💬 Comment: Useful in his younger days, but is a shadow of his former self; losing run up to 33
🔦 Spotlight: Useful in his younger days including a win in Listed company, but despite making the frame a couple of times on the AW this year he is a shadow of his former self; losing run now to to 33; look elsewhere.
Horse quote: 2020-06-28 at Windsor (6f): "Repartee came into the race with pretty good form from his two-year-old days. He was declared for the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot but the ground went too soft and he was pulled out of the race. When I walked into the paddock I thought he looked a picture and the best-looking horse in the ring. He's a horse we've thought a lot of and from two to three he's done very well physically - Andrea Atzeni, rider."
