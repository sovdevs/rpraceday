🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed twice off today's mark since last month's C&D win; probably won't be far away
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins since the autumn, the latest over C&D last month; placed twice off today's mark on Tapeta since (8.6f/1m) and had some excuses when only fifth in higher-grade race at Wolverhampton (9.4f) last time; probably won't be far away.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shaped well when fourth over 1m on recent handicap debut; up in trip today; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who shaped well when fourth on recent handicap debut at Southwell (1m); that was his first start since last April and he has plenty of scope for improvement if this new trip suits.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Displayed significant promise in 1m maiden/novice races; 1m2f ought to suit on h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two 1m maidens last AW season and returned from layoff with a very respectable fourth in Newcastle novice over that trip last month; needs to build on that recent effort but has the potential and his pedigree strongly suggests today's longer trip will suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Usually runs over further but given a good tactical ride to win slowly run C&D contest from near the front last week; recent 3lb rise is not excessive but he's unlikely to have things all his own way again in this higher grade.

🔦 Spotlight: Generally very disappointing since 1m3f Kempton novice win on British Flat debut in January 2024, but has become well handicapped and is likely to have entered a few notebooks when keeping on steadily from the rear for sixth in recent Chelmsford race won by Arcadian Nights; watch the betting.
