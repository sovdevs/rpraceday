🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't get far on recent chasing debut but was in fairly good form over hurdles beforehand
🔦 Spotlight: Unseated rider in early stages of last month's chasing debut but was in fairly good form over hurdles beforehand and remains lightly raced; could still have a good future over fences.
Horse quote: 2024-01-13 at Wetherby (16f): "I thought Sao Carlos's jumping was great up the straight. I loved the way he went through the race, he gave me a really classy feel, although when he came off the bridle it took a while for the penny to drop - Gavin Sheehan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back in Britain after spell with a German stable; on workable mark for new trainer
🔦 Spotlight: Won small-field Plumpton chase for Harriett Dickin (2m1f, good) just over a year ago and is back in Britain after four-race spell for a German stable towards end of 2024; not an easy one to weigh up at present but it will be interesting to see what Olly Murphy can do with him.
Horse quote: 2024-04-01 at Plumpton (17f): "We've only had El Muchacho for a couple of weeks and we're learning about him all the time, but fair play to Bradley, he gave him a very good ride, and his jumping was impeccable - Harriet Dickin, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back in good form since fitted with a visor for last two runs
🔦 Spotlight: Responded well to first-time visor when making all at Plumpton (2m1f, soft) in February and ran well until stamina ebbed away at Fontwell (2m3f, soft) last month; drops back in trip today and will be fine on the faster ground; contender if the new headgear continues to keep him focused.
Horse quote: 2025-02-10 at Plumpton (17f): "Alto Alto was a different horse to the last time I rode him. I couldn't keep him on the bridle last time at Windsor but today he's completely changed with the visor on. A small-runner field and getting his own way in front has made a massive difference and he just loves Plumpton - Freddie Gordon, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very disappointing in recent years but makes stable debut from very tempting mark
🔦 Spotlight: Smart 2m chaser in his prime; generally very disappointing in recent years and absent since pulled up for Richard Bandey last May, but makes debut for latest new stable on a very tempting mark; worth a second look.
Horse quote: 2020-10-23 at Cheltenham (16f): "You see Rouge Vif at his best on better ground. He's got that good-ground action and is so slick to jump out of it. Daryl was saying there was so much pace on beforehand, but they couldn't go his gallop and he was in his comfort zone out there - it was lovely. I'd hoped he'd improved for the summer as he felt more powerful and he's strengthened up a lot and to do that in a handicap off 156 has slightly surprised me. Daryl says he'll stay two and a half, but he's quick and has a high-cruising speed. He looks like a proper two-miler  - Harry Whittington, trainer."

💬 Comment: Absent since disappointing run last summer but resumes on good mark; back in original yard
🔦 Spotlight: Won for Nigel Twiston-Davies at Wincanton (1m7f, good) exactly one year ago; absent since disappointing run for him last July but on a good mark for this first run since rejoining Matt Sheppard; hood refitted; worth a glance in the betting.
