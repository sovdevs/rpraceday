🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bidding for 3-3 in cheekpieces; the move away from soft/heavy may be the chief question
🔦 Spotlight: The cheekpieces went on for his last two starts and he's raised his game, winning in small fields at Wincanton (2m4f, soft; by 16l) and Taunton (extended 2m5f, soft; comfortably) 12 days later; won a maiden hurdle on good to soft in April 2023 but has raced on only soft or heavy since; that seems to ask as much of a question as latest 6lb rise, but he's shortlisted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No win away from Hereford but the 5lb rise since winning last time does not rule him out
🔦 Spotlight: 4-6 at Hereford and has never scored anywhere else but he was short-headed at Uttoxeter in November; last month's win (2m3f, good to soft) was his first for over two years and his best form for almost as long, also his first chase win at 12th attempt, but the runner-up scored next time and they were miles clear of the third, so going back up 5lb does not rule him out.

🔦 Spotlight: Won five soft-ground chases last season (the first two over about 2m4f, the rest about 2m); working his way back to form with second on his last two starts, the latest over C&D when close behind Diplomatic Ash, but both those were also in the mud and he has plenty to prove away from soft or heavy.

💬 Comment: 2m2f win here in December; not so good next time and tailed off in cheekpieces latest
🔦 Spotlight: Two seconds (one here) before winning over 2m2f at this track on soft ground in December; not so good at Huntingdon next time and tailed off when tried in cheekpieces here three weeks ago; they are now set aside but the return to this longer trip may not be ideal.
