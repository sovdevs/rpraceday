🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course bumper winner, won a Grade 2 last season, well below form both starts this term
🔦 Spotlight: Course bumper winner is 3-10 over fences and rated 157; last win came in a Grade 2 chase at Fairyhouse (19.5f, heavy) in April of last year; nowhere near that level of form in two runs this season and was beaten 44l at Windsor on his latest start; needs much more to win this.
