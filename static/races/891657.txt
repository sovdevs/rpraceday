🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice runner-up at Wolverhampton (5f, AW) this year; a player if as effective back on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Patchy form in four starts since returning on the AW in February but has twice finished runner-up at Wolverhampton (5f); something to prove back on turf and may need a stiffer test than this now, but his form still makes him a player; stable won this last year.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won on Carlisle debut but bled next time; off 289 days but proven fresh; hood on
🔦 Spotlight: Sent off 15-2 when making a successful debut at Carlisle (6f, soft) last June (race produced winners) and was reported to have bled when tailed off at Pontefract the following month; hooded on this return from 289 days off and a 🔥 big player given that he has proved he can go well fresh.
Horse quote: 2024-06-17 at Carlisle (6f): "Mayberry Moon had been showing all the right signs at home and our two-year-olds this season are fairly forward to what they normally are. Today he jumped, travelled well and, if you could crab him, he just got a bit lonely in front. He took a fair bit of pulling up and hopefully can build on today - Connor Beasley, jockey, speaking on Racing Tv."
