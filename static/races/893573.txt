🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In-form raider, would probably prefer better ground but has to be taken seriously
🔦 Spotlight: In-form raider whose chase record now stands at an admirable 5-12 following recent wins at Newbury and Chepstow; would probably prefer better ground but has to be taken seriously with Jody Townend booked.
Horse quote: 2025-03-21 at Newbury (22.5f): "The keys to The Boola Boss are a flat track and good ground and, like Becky [Curtis, trainer] said, two [miles] six [furlongs] is probably his perfect trip. Three miles probably stretches him and two and a half [miles] is probably a bit too short so ideal conditions really - Sean Bowen, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports."

💬 Comment: Won readily at Leopardstown last month and may remain competitive off 7lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner at Tipperary last summer; weak chase form before taking a small step in the right direction at Clonmel; won readily at Leopardstown last month and may remain competitive off 7lb higher now that he seems to have turned a corner.
Horse quote: 2024-07-04 at Tipperary (20.5f): "Secrecies Of Stone had nice form through the winter and we hoped he would put things right here. He likes a bit of room in his races and he jumped well. With his rating he was entitled to win that - Sean O'Keeffe, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner and placed twice over hurdles; weak chase form before a breakthrough win at Clonmel last time; may find this too demanding having gone up 10lb.
Horse quote: 2025-03-27 at Clonmel (23f): "Ik's Man was placed a few times in auction maiden hurdles a couple of years ago but then got a leg. I thought he would do that over fences originally, but he was on a winnable mark and the lads will get a good kick out of it - Terence O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Relatively 🔍 unexposed, fair third at this venue in January on only handicap chase start
🔦 Spotlight: Well-related sort; long-priced winner of a 2m4f maiden hurdle at Roscommon last August; initial novice chase form seemed ordinary; however, he showed that his 109 handicap mark is just about right with C&D third in January; made a lot of the running before fading into fourth in a beginners' event at Thurles on stable debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a handicap hurdle and beginners' chase two seasons ago; showed signs of a revival at Limerick; more needed.
Horse quote: 2022-12-19 at Punchestown (23.5f): "Old Soul was entitled to do that. Sean pulled him up quickly the last day which was good. He's not quick, he will probably go over fences quite soon - Liz Doyle, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hit form at around this time last year, should be better for his run in the Topham
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2 novice hurdle winner in 2021; hit form at around this time last year, winning conditions chases at Down Royal and Wexford; should be better for his run in the Topham on only his second outing after a winter break.
Horse quote: 2021-01-17 at Punchestown (16f): "His preparation wasn't ideal and that's maybe why Dreal Deal drifted. He will probably go for the Supreme but will be entered in the Ballymore as well. That was the dream but he had to go and do that today - Ronan McNally, trainer."
