🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m win in January; has won over as short as 1m2f but never dangerous over 1m3f latest
🔦 Spotlight: Course scorer over 1m6f and last month's Newcastle win came at 2m; a 1m2f turf success last summer shows he's effective over much shorter than that but he couldn't muster the pace to land a serious blow when fifth over 1m3f at Southwell last time.
