💬 Comment: Front-running second at Stratford last Sunday and she's a 🔥 big player back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 over hurdles but she made a bold bid and was only just caught by an odds-on rival at Stratford (2m2f, good) last Sunday; was out of the weights that day and she's an interesting contender off 2lb lower on this drop back in trip.

💬 Comment: Made her belated breakthrough at Sedgefield last time; up 9lb but she's a 🔥 big player again
🔦 Spotlight: In-form 8yo who made her belated breakthrough (26th attempt) when scoring in good style at Sedgefield (2m1f, good) 18 days ago; up 9lb but her confidence should be boosted after that success and she remains feasibly treated on her best form; key player.

🔦 Spotlight: Four-time hurdle winner, with first two at this track (2m4f, good) and last two at Taunton (2m, soft); her last success was 15 months ago but that was off 8lb higher and she rallied well to finish second at Ludlow (2m, good) 19 days ago; respected in first-time visor.

💬 Comment: Has not progressed in handicap hurdles and needs to raise her game with cheekpieces added
🔦 Spotlight: Three Flat wins early in 2023 and another at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) that November on second start over hurdles; back from a year off with creditable third on handicap hurdle debut at Hereford in the autumn but she's not gone on from that and was only third of four at Market Rasen last month; mark continues to fall but she's now 1-7 over hurdles and others are more convincing; cheekpieces added.

🔦 Spotlight: Signed off for John Butler with 7f Flat win in October (RPR 80); never involved in three hurdles runs for current yard but she has shown some encouraging signs and this is more realistic now switched to a handicap; possible 🚀 improver, particularly if she can settle a bit better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still early days over hurdles but she needs a transformation on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time Flat winner in France/Spain but she struggled in four hurdle runs for Dan Skelton late last year; still 🔍 unexposed over hurdles and now goes handicapping back in trip but she needs a transformation.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-11 under both codes and pulled up on handicap hurdle debut latest
🔦 Spotlight: 11-race maiden under both codes and she pulled hard before being pulled up on handicap hurdle debut at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft; 14-1) last month; now drops back in trip but she makes little appeal; hood reapplied.
