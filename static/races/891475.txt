🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid C&D comeback two weeks ago; his claims are obvious back in the usual cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Done most racing over 5f and was inclined to hang left without the usual cheekpieces (back on today) over 6f here two weeks ago; that was a solid effort under an aggressive ride, though, and his claims are obvious.

🔦 Spotlight: Gone well fresh before and started favourite for a similar handicap on her C&D comeback a fortnight ago, back to the usual cheekpieces after one try in blinkers; can miss the break and pull hard but she's one to consider despite a wider draw this time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Regressive but holds claims on his recent third, under Rossa Ryan from the inside stall
🔦 Spotlight: Has continued to regress since returning from more than a year off but is on a competitive mark again; holds claims on his recent Thirsk third, now back in the tongue-tie/blinkers and under Rossa Ryan from the inside stall.
Horse quote: 2021-06-11 at Sandown (5f): "We always thought a lot of Mojomaker and there was a reason we took him to the Lily Agnes first time out at Chester as we thought he was good enough to win there. He didn't handle the track on the day but he left that well and truly behind at Goodwood last time. I think he should have won but he threw the race away. He can hang a bit and be a bit of a lad but we put a new bit on his bridle today and it has worked a treat. Pat (Cosgrave, jockey) got off him at Goodwood and said he would love to run him over five furlongs at Sandown. We were very bullish coming down. There is a Listed race back here next month and we will probably look at something like that ahead of the Molecomb at Goodwood - David Loughnane, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: High enough in the weights for his 🆕 new yard and might just need this at his age
🔦 Spotlight: Did almost all his racing, and gained all his wins, for David O'Meara over 5f; closed out last season with an easy victory (picked up for 5,000gns not long after) and being put up 7lb for that sees him high enough in the weights; might just need this at his age.
Horse quote: 2023-07-29 at York (5f): "It's very different. By the time you get to the winning line here, in a chase you'd just be getting your position, but that was fantastic. I thought Soul Seeker had a good each-way chance because he'd won it before, he looked well handicapped on his old form and David had him spot on. I was on a very experienced, streetwise horse. He's a lovely ride and he did everything for me. The other horse put it up to him and he had to put his head down and battle and he did that. He's very genuine - Micheal Nolan, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Has done most winning on the AW and never off a mark this high; pulled hard and met a bit of traffic when comfortably held behind two of these on her C&D comeback a fortnight ago, and needs to improve on that.
Horse quote: 2023-02-17 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "I don't think Daytona Lady liked Kempton the last day. She's been working very well at home - Darragh Keenan, rider, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tumbled down the weights last year before undergoing wind surgery; worth keeping an eye on
🔦 Spotlight: Tumbled down the weights last year before undergoing wind surgery; was inclined to pull hard and didn't see it out on his Tapeta comeback, and the suspicion is he'll be back at some point.
Horse quote: 2023-08-29 at Ripon (6f): "Everything was very straightforward. They went very hard early doors and dropping back in grade, Twelfth Knight just needed a bit of confidence more than anything. He's been running in better races and he's been a bit heartbroken a few times but he's a decent enough animal and hopefully he can progress. To be fair to him, when I needed him today he stuck it out. We were off the bridle early but he always stays the five furlongs well. I'm delighted for the owners and Paul - Ryan Sexton, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
