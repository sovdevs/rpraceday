🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big step forward on Flat h'cap debut when scoring at Catterick; player under 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: A fairly useful winning hurdler who took a big step forward on his Flat handicap debut when scoring at Catterick (1m4f) a week ago; a player under a 5lb penalty.
Horse quote: 2023-12-16 at Cheltenham (17f): "The Fred Winter is what we discussed two or three weeks ago. An Bradan Feasa would be 50-1 in a Triumph Hurdle, but although he will go up again today he would have a competitive enough weight in the Fred Winter. He will have a quiet enough time now and he will have one more run before March and see where we end up. He is very easy to ride, and Tom said he is an absolute delight. It (the Fred Winter) wouldn't be any bother to him. He has sat third there today and you could let him sit mid division to the rear in the Fred Winter and let him travel away  - Jack Jones, trainer."

💬 Comment: Looked rusty after six months off when sixth at Kempton latest; needs considering
🔦 Spotlight: Looked rusty after six months off when a never-dangerous sixth of ten in 1m Kempton handicap 15 days ago; has won at up to 1m4f under today's rider Sarah Bowen and he needs considering with latest run under his belt.
Horse quote: 2024-09-01 at Brighton (12f): "Pride Of Nepal just seems to be in great form. He's been running thereabouts and was able to win last week. He takes his racing ever so well, and by the end of last week he was bouncing again. He's so straightforward, a jockey's dream. He's a pleasure to do everything with. There's a lot of amateur races out there and the next port of call will be the Cambridgeshire. The stiff mile [and] one [furlong] would probably suit him, and he won over that trip at Goodwood. That win should put us up a few pounds so he should get in - Sarah Bowen, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Scored at Bath (11.5f) last September but she came in last of six on her return in 1m4f Wolverhampton handicap last month; she has a bit to prove now.
Horse quote: 2022-10-22 at Newbury (12f): "Even when you've got a soft-ground horse you never know if they'll go on heavy and it's like a ploughed field, but Mrs Meader handled it beautifully. We've found the key to her, which is softer ground, and she's flourished. I think the owner wants to give her another year racing and then breed from here - Ross Birkett, jockey."
