🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 4yo who has potential off his current mark, for a trainer who does well here
🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise on turf in 2023 (including on good ground) and returned from an absence to win a maiden at Southwell (1m, AW) last month, having had gelding/wind surgeries; had 3l to spare last time and this lightly raced 4yo has potential off his current mark, for a trainer who does well here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His four wins last year were on slow ground but his reappearance second came on good going
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins last year (all on slow ground, including over C&D) and a close second in this race (soft); unlikely to have his preferred slow surface today but the going was good (good to firm in places) when he reappeared with a close second at Ripon (1m) a fortnight ago; respected.
Horse quote: 2022-07-30 at Thirsk (8f): "On The River won on this day last year. He's consistent. I was a bit worried about the ground over this trip but he toughed it out. He's got a good attitude - Ben Haslam, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Improved form the last twice, making all at Kempton (1m, AW) and over this C&D (good); clearly thriving and latest 5lb rise may not stop him.
Horse quote: 2023-09-06 at Gowran Park (8f): "I didn't use my whip much as I was fairly confident Partisan Hero was doing enough the whole way up the straight. His last furlong was probably his best so he will be able to go up in trip. There should be improvement in him - Jake Coen, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from his 16 starts and 0-8 last year, but he ran some good races last term including when a close third on his reappearance (1m, good to firm); edging down the weights and might not be far away.
Horse quote: 2023-08-12 at Haydock (8f): "Leadenhall has always had a lot of talent. They've ironed out a few of his issues, the headgear was off today and it worked out nicely. Hopefully this will be a confidence booster - Hector Crouch, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Newcastle last month but down the field at Chelmsford only 12 days ago
🔦 Spotlight: Close third at Ripon (1m2f, good) last May and won at Newcastle (1m, AW) last month on second start back from an absence; it's possible he'll bounce back from a below-par latest run at Chelmsford (1m, AW) but that was just 12 days ago; ran well in Ireland on sole previous outing in cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Three AW wins at about 1m last January-July and he has a lower mark to work with on turf; hasn't had many goes on grass but he hasn't really shone on this surface; absent since last September, so a couple of things to prove.
