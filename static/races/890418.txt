🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pleasing debut when fourth at Doncaster last autumn; this step up in distance should suit
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten only by three runners with experience when an encouraging fourth of eighth at Doncaster (1m, soft; 15-2) towards the end of last season, left behind from 2f out; has a useful middle-distance pedigree and likely to stay this longer trip; open to plenty of improvement.
