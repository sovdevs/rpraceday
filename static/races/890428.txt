💬 Comment: Improved second of 11 at Chelmsford (1m2f, AW) last time and that's despite racing wide
🔦 Spotlight: Tongue tied under Jack Callan for both his handicaps, improved second of 11 at Chelmsford (1m2f, AW) last time and that's despite racing wide; this longer trip holds plenty of interest too and he is one to note on turf debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Had three wins in the space of four races last February-April, including this contest (on good) which he took in fine style; back to the same mark today, due to underperforming since last June, but the switch back from AW seemed to do him some good last year, so he needs a second look.

💬 Comment: Consistent; needs to improve on his turf form to win this but no way is he dismissed
🔦 Spotlight: In the frame on all three starts at this track (all last year) and his consistent form for current stable (when usually ridden by Taylor Fisher) also includes two autumn wins at Wolverhampton; needs to improve on his turf form to win this but no way is he dismissed.

🔦 Spotlight: Only one win from 36 races and although it was over C&D last August, that's from 19 visits here; while she's not the percentage call, a close third over C&D 16 days ago reiterated that she could be on the premises.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-34 score, last win in 2023; seconds and thirds last May-August give him a form chance
🔦 Spotlight: 2-34 overall, with his last win in 2023 but he had a dose of seconds and thirds last May-August which give him a form chance; reappearance asks a question and he was soundly beaten on his only two starts on softer than good.
Horse quote: 2023-09-04 at Brighton (10f): "Relieved is the word - Angel On High has been a little bit frustrating. It's been tough getting to this point and I could scarcely believe he came fifth last time. Maybe the drop back in trip helped him today. His previous form looks like he wants a mile and a half but he's such a strong traveller - perhaps we were barking up the wrong tree with that. He isn't a monkey this horse, he has just had a few issues and maybe he thinks about them a bit. His confidence has been growing the past few months and that will do him the world of good. He had every excuse to down tools but he was very brave - Adrian Wintle, trainer."

💬 Comment: Going down by 1l at Lingfield (1m2f, AW) on penultimate start stands out in his six races
🔦 Spotlight: Six races and going down by a length on handicap debut at Lingfield (1m2f, AW) on penultimate start stands out; he didn't get the clearest of runs from off the pace that day and the same was true on turf debut Brighton eight days ago; has raced freely but now steps up in trip.
