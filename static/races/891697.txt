💬 Comment: Useful Flat racer who won 20-runner Navan maiden on recent hurdling debut; good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Developed into a useful Flat racer last year and made very good start to hurdling career this month, winning 20-runner Navan maiden (2m, good to yielding); will be a very tough nut to crack if she's in similar form here, and she has very obvious scope to build on that performance.
Horse quote: 2024-08-25 at Naas (10.5f): "Fiver Friday handled the course here from her maiden form  and for her to get her head in front in Ireland is brilliant. They went plenty hard early on and set it up for her - Paul Traynor, trainer."

💬 Comment: Much improved form on last two outings, latterly when winning at Carlisle this month
🔦 Spotlight: Displayed major improvement when very close second to short-odds favourite at Newcastle (2m1f, good) last month and did not need to make any further progress to justify short odds himself at Carlisle (2m1f, good) a fortnight ago; has another big role to play today.

Horse quote: 2022-05-22 at York (16.5f): "It depends what mark Evaluation ends up with but there's a staying race at the Sunday Series at Musselburgh in two weeks and as long as he's okay from a handicapping point of view he'll go there - Keith Dalgleish, trainer."
