💬 Comment: 1st foal of Group 1 winner Laurens; green but won maiden at Newcastle (7f, Tapeta); ✂️ gelded
🔦 Spotlight: 42,000gns May 3yo; first foal of the multiple Group 1-winning Laurens; 13-2, green but always prominent and kept on well to lead final 1f when winning an 11-runner maiden at Newcastle (7f, Tapeta) six weeks ago; ✂️ gelded two days later; improvement is needed but that was a promising start.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: If she builds on her C&D debut third even a little she should be seriously involved again
🔦 Spotlight: First foal of a 6f/7f winner (including Listed; RPR 106); 3-1 for novice over C&D in December, bumped at the start and running green but always in touch to finish a close third of nine; if she builds on that even a little she should be seriously involved again.

💬 Comment: 222-day absence since is a nagging worry, but one of the form picks and looked promising
🔦 Spotlight: Ran in three 7f novice events last April-July, showing plenty of ability in them all and he finished well (after hanging left) when a close third at Haydock on the third occasion; the absence since is a nagging worry but he's one of the form picks and looked promising when last seen.

🔦 Spotlight: Minor honours in bumpers for Victor Dartnall; remote on hurdle debut and absent 937 days before embarking on Flat career in December, runner-up in a novice here on second occasion (modest form) and he seemed to get the 1m3f that day; big rethink on trip and he's probably best watched this time.

🔦 Spotlight: First foal of a 6f/7f winner (including Listed; RPR 106); 3-1 for novice over C&D in December, bumped at the start and running green but always in touch to finish a close third of nine; if she builds on that even a little she should be seriously involved again.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran in three 7f novice events last April-July, showing plenty of ability in them all and he finished well (after hanging left) when a close third at Haydock on the third occasion; the absence since is a nagging worry but he's one of the form picks and looked promising when last seen.

🔦 Spotlight: Minor honours in bumpers for Victor Dartnall; remote on hurdle debut and absent 937 days before embarking on Flat career in December, runner-up in a novice here on second occasion (modest form) and he seemed to get the 1m3f that day; big rethink on trip and he's probably best watched this time.
