🔦 Spotlight: Rewarded good market support when scoring over C&D (soft) on seasonal/hurdle debut in October and bounced back from a lesser effort when very respectable second at Ffos Las (2m4f, heavy) in December; drops back in trip today; has another big role to play.

💬 Comment: C&D winner in October and returned to form with 2m4f Ffos Las second in December
🔦 Spotlight: Rewarded good market support when scoring over C&D (soft) on seasonal/hurdle debut in October and bounced back from a lesser effort when very respectable second at Ffos Las (2m4f, heavy) in December; drops back in trip today; has another big role to play.
