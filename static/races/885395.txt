🔦 Spotlight: Rewarded good market support when scoring over C&D (soft) on seasonal/hurdle debut in October and bounced back from a lesser effort when very respectable second at Ffos Las (2m4f, heavy) in December; drops back in trip today; has another big role to play.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Low-key rules debut when fourth of five in Stratford bumper in October
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a heavy-ground point bumper last March but managed only fourth of five in rules bumper at Stratford (soft) in October and needs major improvement on this hurdling debut; tongue-tie removed.
