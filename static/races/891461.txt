💬 Comment: Went close on AW recently; it remains to be seen if he's still fully effective on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Went close off this mark at Newcastle (1m, AW) recently on second stable start and he should be fine now back at 7f; major player if backing up his latest performance but he ran below par last May/June on his last two grass starts so the switch of the surface is a big question mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: He's tumbled down the weights but has struggled in the last 12 months
🔦 Spotlight: He's tumbled down the weights but has finished no better than seventh across his seven starts in the last 12 months; the reapplied tongue-tie and first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) need to have a dramatic effect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: May have needed reappearance run but needs to be an entirely different proposition today
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row at Catterick (7f, good/soft) last season; ran well on last visit here and he may have needed his reappearance run at Catterick a fortnight ago, but this 11yo was beaten a long way and needs to be an entirely different proposition this evening.
Horse quote: 2017-05-01 at Windsor (8f): "Pat gave Desert Dream a good ride. We'll run him over further in handicaps now. The ground was perfect. Absolutely perfect - Sir Evelyn De Rothschild, owner-breeder."
