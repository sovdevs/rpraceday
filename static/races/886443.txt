🔦 Spotlight: Favourite for both starts on turf for Charlie Appleby last summer, beaten under a length into third of 11 at Yarmouth (6f, good to firm) on the second occasion (form worked out quite well); should stay 7f and worth a 📊 market check on debut for last year's winning stable; new headgear combination.

💬 Comment: Not beaten far in two 6f novices in the autumn; may be one for handicaps after this
🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in two 6f novices at Newcastle (Tapeta) and Kempton (Polytrack; first-time hood) in the autumn; extra furlong shouldn't be a problem and she's bred to be useful, but handicaps may be her thing after this.
