üí¨ Comment: Struggled this winter but several reasons to expect a better showing down in class today
üî¶ Spotlight: Had a productive 11 months from August 2023, winning six times (including C&D); has struggled this winter and the handicapper has been slow to react but his latest 2lb drop, in a race where he didn't run as badly as the distance beaten suggests, makes him eligible for this Class 4 event; cheekpieces now tried and Billy Loughnane, who is 3-5 (one void race) on him, returns to the saddle; better expected.
