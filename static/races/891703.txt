🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easily obliged when 1-5 and he's a big form player judged on placed efforts either side
🔦 Spotlight: Easily obliged when 1-5 at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) in December and showed better form when placed on starts either side; his jumping wasn't great on heavy last time (third at 8-15) but he was withdrawn when the ground was officially good at Newbury last month; big form player.
Horse quote: 2024-12-17 at Wincanton (15f): "We've just crept away very quietly with Don't Mind If I Do. He only had the one run in the sales race last season and bumped into a good horse of Olly's [Murphy] at Warwick last time. He's a hell of a height when you stand into him and he's not a horse I'll rush back. I'll give him a month or so, then go somewhere with a penalty I would imagine - Alan King, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: 200-1 when tailed off at Cheltenham Festival; 🔥 big player judged on her better efforts
🔦 Spotlight: Ten hurdle races, winning a C&D handicap (good) in October under Nathan Andrews who today rides her for first time since; apparent best form when fifth in a Grade 2 for her sex at Ascot in January, but she hung right and eventually tailed off (after making the running) when 200-1 in the mares' novice at Cheltenham Festival; 🔥 big player judged on her better efforts.

💬 Comment: Won three-runner race latest; can improve but much better is needed against some of these
🔦 Spotlight: Showed significant ability in his two bumpers and on hurdling debut, before turning over a red-hot favourite in three-runner maiden hurdle at Exeter (2m, good) five weeks ago; his jumping was better last time but he still looked green; can improve but much better is needed against some of these.

💬 Comment: Absent 482 days before tailed off in four races on Flat and one over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Fair form for 1m Flat win in July 2023; however, absent 482 days before tailed off for 🆕 new yard in four races on Flat and one over hurdles.
Horse quote: 2023-07-30 at Pontefract (8f): "That was very nice but possibly a slightly pleasant surprise because Silk Bird ran atrociously last time and we never found out why. The cheekpieces seem to have helped and dropping back to a stiff mile must have helped a bit. We rode her like she seemed to favour in the past, racing prominently. But last time she just seemed to hate the job and today she seemed to love it. I can't explain it - Jedd O'Keeffe, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three easy wins before his shock defeat at at Plumpton (2m4f, good) last month; hooded now
🔦 Spotlight: Won his bumper and his first two starts over hurdles, latterly when sauntering to success at Carlisle (2m1f, soft) in February; a bad mistake played a part when he was comprehensively turned over at 1-8 at Plumpton (2m4f, good) last month but he's now also back down in trip and has a hood; Mullins challenger from Ireland who needs plenty of respect.
