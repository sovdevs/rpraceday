💬 Comment: Has dropped to a dangerous mark should cheekpieces have the desired effect
🔦 Spotlight: Last season went well, winning two handicap chases over similar trips on heavy ground (won over hurdles on good to soft); only bright spot this campaign (in a tongue-tie that's now removed) was his remote second to an 🚀 improver at Exeter on New Year's Day; has dropped to a dangerous mark should cheekpieces have the desired effect.

🔦 Spotlight: Won his handicap over hurdles off 3lb higher but has been beaten between 19l and 29l in his three races over fences (all handicaps from 2m4f-3m); clearly on a useful mark should the new cheekpieces trigger something but doubts remain in this discipline.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning hurdler but pulled up 20 days ago after a mammoth absence; chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Plumpton handicap hurdle at this trip but was returning from a mammoth absence when pulled up at Fontwell three weeks ago (2m5f, soft); good ground seems ideal for him and he's a 10yo making his chase debut (1-1 in points).
