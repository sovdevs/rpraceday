🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won her last six points and performed well in two hunter chases during that spell
🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame in two 2m4f Ludlow hunter chases towards the end of last season and held on well to win a recent point, her sixth consecutive win in that sphere; won't mind if the ground ends up quicker than good and ought to make her presence felt again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back from long absence tonight but will be hard to beat if still as good as she was
🔦 Spotlight: Looked a very promising pointer/hunter chaser a few years ago, most notably when winning at this meeting (3m2f, good) in 2022; absent since open point success in February 2023 but will be hard to beat if still as good as she was.
Horse quote: 2022-04-29 at Cheltenham (26f): "If I'd known I was going to get there that easy, I would have waited a bit longer. Latenightfumble is a bit like her brother as she looks around when she gets to the front but this was a massive step up for her as she's only competed in points in small runner fields previously - Gina Andrews, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gave good account of herself in this race a year ago but a minor role may be her best hope
🔦 Spotlight: Has modest 1-15 strike-rate in points; gave good account of herself in four-runner edition of this race last year but was tired and well held before her last-fence fall; a minor role may be her best hope.
