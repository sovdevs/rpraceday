🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole win came over C&D and he ran well here last time, but he has refused to race; risky
🔦 Spotlight: Landed a 0-50 classified event over C&D (66-1) in January and finished third of ten behind Strategic Fortune in a handicap here a fortnight ago; starts have been an issue, though, and he refused to race at all on his penultimate outing; risky.
Horse quote: 2025-01-04 at Wolverhampton (AW) (9.5f): "It's Desiderata's first run for us. We worked him up in Lambourn in the week and he went very well with a 60-rated horse so we expected him to run a nice race - Thomas Faulkner, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All four AW wins have come over C&D including last time; outside stall makes things tricky
🔦 Spotlight: All four AW wins have come over C&D including when ending a 16-race losing run in returning cheekpieces a fortnight ago; 2lb rise not excessive but the outside stall makes things tricky.
Horse quote: 2021-04-03 at Cork (7f): "Strategic Fortune was on his last chance today because he's been disappointing but he has ability. The little ease in the ground seemed to help him. He's often slow out of the stalls but the blinkers we fitted him with at Dundalk last week seemed to sharpen him up a bit. He didn't seem to handle it there at all and broke slow here again but it seemed to help because they went hard up front. Over 7f here on that ground it takes a bit of getting and it just seemed to fall apart. I mostly pre-train and break yearlings, I don't have that many runners for the track - John O'Shea, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Chelmsford in November and a fair fourth over C&D a fortnight ago; frame material
🔦 Spotlight: Nothing like as good as he was but showed he could do it at the right level when successful at Chelmsford (1m2f, Polytrack) in November; fair fourth of ten (just behind Port Noir) over C&D recently; could make the frame.
Horse quote: 2021-05-02 at Newmarket (10f): "River Alwen did well. He benefited from Newbury, he needed that run and was a bit fresh. He was dropped 2lb for that and this was a winnable race. I think ten furlongs is his trip but he will get more adaptable to middle-distances as he goes along. He should progress and improve again - Jamie Spencer, rider."
