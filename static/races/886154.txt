🔦 Spotlight: First foal from a 1m6f winner; cost £60,000 after going close in two Irish points in the autumn; his form has not worked out particularly well in the meantime but, nevertheless, he's an interesting recruit for Joe Tizzard.

💬 Comment: Bought for £60,000 after going close in two Irish points in the autumn; rules debut today
🔦 Spotlight: First foal from a 1m6f winner; cost £60,000 after going close in two Irish points in the autumn; his form has not worked out particularly well in the meantime but, nevertheless, he's an interesting recruit for Joe Tizzard.
