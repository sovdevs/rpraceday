🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid novice form in Gr 3s and a Gr 1 last season, ideal conditions here, hard to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Course winner is 4-11 under Rules and 2-6 over fences; beat Spillane's Tower in a heavy ground Grade 3 novice chase at Navan (2m) in March and followed that with a fine effort behind that rival in a Grade 1 at Fairyhouse over 2m4f, again on heavy; trip and ground were against him on latest and he could get back on track returned to 2m on heavy ground.
