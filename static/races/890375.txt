🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close in big field on Doncaster reappearance and he's respected off unchanged mark
🔦 Spotlight: Recorded his third turf win when scoring by 8l at Chester (1m2f, good to soft) on penultimate run last term; shot back up the weights after that but he went close in big field on Doncaster reappearance (1m2f, good) last month; seemed as good as ever in that placed effort and he's strongly respected.
Horse quote: 2024-03-24 at Doncaster (10f): "We trained Qitaal as a two-year-old but sadly at the time Shadwell were cutting back and sold all of our horses. I made as strong a case as I could that this was one they didn't want to be letting go of and when Robert Ng bought him I contacted them and asked if there was any chance this horse could stay with us. We think a lot of him. He went to Ireland and was only seen once in two years and when I saw his name in the Tattersalls August catalogue I thought I had to see him. He was a bit of a shell of the horse who left us but when he was making 4,000gns I couldn't leave him behind so I bought him back and threw him to the field for the rest of last year.  We've been bringing him back this spring, his work had been good and that wasn't a surprise, although I worried the ground might find him out after two years off. He's a horse we liked three years ago and now he's finally fulfilling that potential - Charlie Johnston, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Triple turf winner (1m1f-1m4f), who is well treated on old form but he generally struggled last season including on final run at Newcastle (AW) in October; comes with risks attached on his return and others are more convincing.
Horse quote: 2023-08-25 at York (12f): "Ryan [Moore] said he just jumped a little bit awkwardly and that they didn't go as quickly as they might have. Marhaba The Champ was running a little bit free with him but he relaxed and let him fill up. He's done it well and that was a class ride. He'll probably get further but needs to relax a bit more. That's an avenue for the future but we'll probably stick to this trip for now - Kevin Ryan, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won this in 2023 and was runner-up last year; one to keep an eye on back on the Flat
🔦 Spotlight: Won this race in 2023 and was runner-up last year; added a hurdle win to his record last summer and he ended last year with a fair third at Sedgefield (2m1f, soft); returns after 129 days off but he's on a dangerous mark and needs a close look back on the Flat.
