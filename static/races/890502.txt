🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Kept on for third over 2m4f at the Cheltenham Festival and worth another go at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Flat-bred gelding who hasn't convinced on two previous attempts at 3m, the latest a Grade 1 novice at Kempton in December; however, he rallied for third at Cheltenham (nearly 2m5f, soft) in January and kept on well when filling the same position in the Plate at the Festival (extended 2m4f, good to soft); worth another go at this trip and could have a part to play.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "The start wasn't ideal, but there we go. We were a little better off at the weights with the winner, but he is obviously an improving horse as well. I think we can probably go up in trip with Masaccio, but I didn't want to do it this week with cheekpieces on, however maybe I should have done. I'm not sure if there is anything at Aintree for him or Ayr, although Ayr would be a quick enough track for him, but I'd like to run him once more this season, and probably over a bit further. I think we could look at the Coral Gold Cup next season and have a run beforehand. Eventually he could be for those real long distance races as he is so relaxed and he gives himself every chance of staying - Alan King, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made it two wins in a row over C&D in January; excuses since; could be on a good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Promising third on good ground on chase debut here in November and won his next two, over C&D (soft) on the second occasion; has had excuses at Cheltenham the next twice, an inadequate 2m5f on the first occasion then being badly hampered early on at the Festival last time; could be on a good mark if things click again for him this afternoon.
Horse quote: 2025-01-02 at Ayr (24f): "Whistle Stop Tour is a really progressive 7yo and Derek [Fox] was really positive about him after his Kelso win. He has plenty of options open to him. There's the 3m6f novice handicap chase at Cheltenham, there's a nice race at Uttoxeter soon after or there's always the Scottish National back here. Our dream though would be the 2026 Grand National - Sean Tracey, joint-owner, talking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten at the Cheltenham Festival but in good form previously & could bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: Has finished second a lot more often than he's won and he was soundly beaten at Cheltenham last month; however, he went there on the back of creditable second placings at Exeter (2m3f, soft) and Newbury (2m7f, soft); also effective on good ground; could be in the mix now back in calmer waters.
Horse quote: 2024-03-09 at Sandown (20f): "Pic Roc ran a mighty race in second. He probably got a bit lonely out in front after doing plenty and got nabbed on the line, but they've both run really well - Ben Pauling, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark over fences at the fourth attempt in Newbury handicap in February (2m7f, soft; Pic Roc second); also effective on good going; merely mid-division in the Jack Richards at Cheltenham since but he's back in a less competitive race here and he could tap back into his previous promise.
Horse quote: 2024-01-06 at Wincanton (21.5f): "I think Lord Of Thunder is going in the right direction, he's improved since his last win. He quickened up when I wanted him to from the back of two-out and he's put ten lengths between the others fairly rapidly. Regardless of what he's beaten, he couldn't have done it much easier. He goes through this ground like it's good ground. He's quite exciting, I don't like to get too carried away but he's got a nice future. He's earned the right now to step up in grade - Brendan Powell, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."
