🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising second here (7f) last month and he's open to more progress on this drop in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to owner's top-class 3yo miler Rosallion; faded into a well-held fifth on Redcar debut (7f, soft) in November but he left that form behind when a front-running second here (7f) last month; that form puts him firmly in the picture and he's open to more progress on this drop in trip.
