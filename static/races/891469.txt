🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won first time out four times now, including this race last year; leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Has won first time out in four of his five seasons, including when landing this race off a 3lb higher mark last spring; that came under Jason Hart from a similar draw and there's a decent chance he makes it five from six.
Horse quote: 2022-05-06 at Chester (7.5f): "Red Mirage jumped from the gate really well and I wanted to hold a forward position with him and he got a bit lit up doing that. He then relaxed and when I took it to him, he really did point his toe out nicely - David Probert, jockey."

💬 Comment: Potentially well handicapped if wind surgery since last seen seven months ago has helped
🔦 Spotlight: Best suited by an easy, turning 7f, so has that in his favour, but he struggled last year, coming 16lb down the weights; signs of life latterly, though, and is potentially well handicapped if wind surgery since last seen seven months ago has helped.

🔦 Spotlight: Has done most of his racing in sprints and his stamina looked to give way on his 7f Leicester comeback (has won fresh before); there was plenty to like about the way he travelled for a long way, though, and today's easier course will help.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pleasing comeback here a fortnight ago and won't mind going back up to 7f; considered
🔦 Spotlight: Struggled last year, aside from a 6f win here off a similar mark in June; confirmed his liking for the course when hitting traffic and making a pleasing comeback a fortnight ago, and won't mind going back up to 7f (likely to be dropped in again from stall ten).
Horse quote: 2024-06-18 at Catterick (6f): "When I first got Animate I thought he was going to be a proper horse. He's been a bit disappointing, but I've taken the extra headgear off and he's loved it today. That's the first time he's won on turf, hopefully he can take off from it. I haven't had him that long, but I've found the key to him and he'll go forward now -  Geoffrey Harker, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Done a lot of her recent racing on the AW and hasn't been in much form; fared no better back on turf at Doncaster last month and is some way down the pecking order.
Horse quote: 2023-07-26 at Catterick (6f): "Petra Celera is improving. I don't think she does a lot when she hits the front and I'd say a visor may not go amiss - but having said that, if you take the second out she's absolutely bolted up so I'm very pleased and the horses are running well - Karl Burke, trainer."
