🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hit a flat spot before keeping on at Ludlow and he's now stepping up from 2m5f
🔦 Spotlight: Unable to justify favouritism at Ludlow a month ago (2m5f, good to soft) but he kept on well after hitting a flat spot and it's easy to envisage improvement now he goes over further, especially with him so lightly raced; on the shortlist.

💬 Comment: Kept on for second behind an 🚀 improver here last time over 2m4f; stays this far
🔦 Spotlight: Stays this far so it was an encouraging effort when keeping on for second over 2m4f here recently (soft; has won on good), especially as the winner has since gone on to complete a hat-trick; last time was also a rare appearance without any aids and that's again the case; Ben Bromley is also able to claim this time; feared.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't won under rules since 2019 and much-reduced mark looks justified
🔦 Spotlight: Still in touch when unseating four out at Ascot last time (2m7f, good; 50-1) but it was still a long way from home; hasn't won under rules since 2019 and much-reduced mark looks justified.
