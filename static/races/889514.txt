🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Win and good third in her two 2yo runs and she sets the standard on return; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Made a good start when justifying support at Windsor (6f, good to firm) last August and she found improvement when a front-running third under penalty at Goodwood three weeks later; returns after 213 days off but she sets the standard and should be fine on this drop to 5f; key player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Showed ability on her Kempton debut (6f) last summer; needs checking in market on comeback
🔦 Spotlight: 22-1 for her Kempton debut (6f, AW) last June but she ran well for a long way before fading into a 3l sixth of 11; returns after a lengthy absence but that initial form is not far off the standard here and she's one to keep an eye on.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Showed promise on Kempton debut (7f) in October and he needs watching in market on return
🔦 Spotlight: 220,000euros yearling; faded into sixth of 12 on Kempton debut (7f) in October but that was behind a useful rival and he wasn't beaten far; ✂️ gelded since and now drops to 5f on his return but yard is in good form and he needs watching in market.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went off too fast on recent 7f debut and he looks interesting on this drop in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Mehmas gelding out of a Group-placed 5f/6f 2yo winner (RPR 95), well-held sixth of eight on his debut here (7f) 16 days ago but he went off too fast in that race and it wouldn't be a surprise if he took a major step forward on this drop in trip; one to keep an eye on.
