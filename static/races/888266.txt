💬 Comment: Irish point second; third in a bumper and then fifth in strong novice hurdle; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in his second point in Ireland (3m, yielding; winner was fourth in the Turners on Wednesday); fair third in a Chepstow bumper on stable debut (2m, good to soft) in October and, although only fifth in a 2m novice there (good) the following month, that is solid form; down in grade and up in trip; chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner for Henry Daly in February 2023 (2m, good); runner-up in novice hurdles at Warwick (2m5f, good) and Catterick (2m3f, good to soft) later that year; subsequently off for 305 days and although his comeback was decent he's been pulled up in two handicaps since, the latest with cheekpieces tried (visored this time); has a bit to prove.
