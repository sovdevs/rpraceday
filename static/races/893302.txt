🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Okay run on heavy on debut, fine effort on good at Navan latest, leading form claims
🔦 Spotlight: Ran okay on debut at Galway on testing ground last October; much better on turf debut on seasonal reappearance at Navan earlier this month (1m, good) in first-time tongue tie (retained); leading form claims on that if he is as effective back on a softer surface.

💬 Comment: Fine effort behind now 109 rated horse at Galway on debut, big chance if handles soft
🔦 Spotlight: Ran a blinder on only start last season when a 2.5l second behind the now 109 rated Monumental in a 7f Galway maiden on good ground; steps up to 1m and has a big chance on that form if he handles the likely softer conditions.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form of AW maiden run has been boosted, bred for turf, should be staying on at the finish
🔦 Spotlight: Ran really well on debut in a 1m maiden at Dundalk in February, staying on for a 1l third behind the now 103 rated Tiberius Thunder; Blue Point colt is bred to handle turf but he might need a bit further than this; should be doing his best work at the finish.
