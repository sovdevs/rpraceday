🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled when 40-1 for handicap hurdle debut here (2m3f); tries a new trip today
🔦 Spotlight: Struggled when 40-1 for handicap debut here (2m3f, good to soft) in January; that was his first run after a long layoff and he remains 🔍 unexposed but he needs to be a completely different proposition over this new trip.
