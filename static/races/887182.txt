🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made it 2-4 over fences in ready fashion at Ffos Las; 8lb rise may not prevent a follow-up
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 7yo who made it 2-4 over fences when scoring at Ffos Las (3m, heavy) three weeks ago following a second wind operation; did it readily and an 8lb rise may not be enough to prevent a follow-up win.
