🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below form at Kempton Christmas meeting but landed a good prize here (2m5f) in November
🔦 Spotlight: 2-8 over hurdles; ran in snatches and was below form at Kempton over Christmas but landed a good prize here (2m5f, good) in November and should be fine over today's longer trip; obvious contender if back on song.

🔦 Spotlight: Launched handicap career with three good-ground wins last spring (2m1f-2m5f) and was placed on her next two outings (2m4f/2m5f, good); could still have more to offer over 3m but we haven't seen her since a disappointing run here in November; had wind op in January.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Close/clear second to a next-time-out winner over C&D on last month's handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m3f Bangor maiden on good ground last summer and, following a six-month absence, looked very well suited by the step up in trip when close/clear second to a next-time-out winner over C&D (soft; first-time tongue-tie) on handicap debut in February; went up 6lb for that but she still has strong claims today.
