🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved form when close 2nd on handicap debut (6f); well worth a go at 7f; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Well held in first three sprint runs but despite racing freely from off the pace she found plenty to go down narrowly on handicap debut at Southwell (6f), just unable to get past a determined rival; worth a go over 7f; respected.

🔦 Spotlight: Big prices for all three runs at sprint trips, improving each time and keeping on in fourth of five on this track three weeks ago; should stay 7f on pedigree and there could be more in the offing now handicapping; worth 📊 market check in first-time headgear.

🔦 Spotlight: Looked to have more to offer as a sprinter when coming home nicely into fourth in a good race for the grade here (5f) in January, then kept on at the same pace at Wolverhampton since; pedigree suggests 7f should be within her scope if the change of tempo doesn't catch her out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rank outsider for all 3 starts, hinting at ability over C&D; this is her best chance yet
🔦 Spotlight: Rank outsider for all three starts, getting closest when beaten nearly 6l in C&D novice run at a slow pace on her second start; needs a bit more than she's shown so far at 1m and 7f but this is her best chance yet.
