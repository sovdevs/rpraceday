🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won in October on sole chase start and back on the scoresheet over h'dles recently; player
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Hexham (1m7f, soft) in October on sole chase start and back on the scoresheet in selling handicap hurdle at Fakenham (2m, good) eight days ago, when he also had something to spare; bought in for £8,200 afterwards; he's 8lb higher than for those last two wins but can play another leading role.

💬 Comment: Third at Down Royal last month despite first-fence blunder; could be involved
🔦 Spotlight: Early unseat at Down Royal in December on second chase start and made bad mistake at the first fence there last month (2m, good to yielding); however, he ran well to finish third and could be involved if minimising the blunders and handling the ground (soft going would be a question mark).

🔦 Spotlight: Below par over hurdles the last twice and a return to form is needed on this first run over fences; however, this 6yo is a three-time hurdle winner whose trainer's horses often make better chasers than hurdlers; dropping down the weights and no surprise if he bounces back with a bold show.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair fifth of seven over C&D on chase debut and could be sharper for that outing
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up three times in a row in maiden hurdles last year (1m7f-2m1f, good), for Paul Nicholls on first two occasions; ran okay when fifth of seven on last month's chase debut over C&D (2m, soft; behind Coup De Coeur) and he could be sharper for that first outing in 103 days; not ruled out.
