💬 Comment: Landed a gamble over extended 2m3f here (good) 16 days ago, wandering and with head high
🔦 Spotlight: Found it tough in handicaps until landing a gamble in ten-runner race over the extended 2m3f here (good) 16 days ago under Callum Pritchard, despite wandering and carrying his head high; back up 4lb in a larger field and tries a new trip, but he has to be considered.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark by a nose at Fontwell (3m2f) and close third at Ascot (3m, also on good) later in November; cheekpieces (tried once last term) returned over C&D last month and he was back to form in second of ten to an 🔍 unexposed favourite; has a 4lb rise but looks a leading contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: While again shaping as if could be a stayer, 32l margin of defeat last time is a concern
🔦 Spotlight: No match for the first three when fourth of ten as well-backed favourite on handicap debut at Taunton (2m3f, soft); again shaped as if he could be a stayer when trying 2m5f at Ludlow (soft) later in February but the margin of his defeat (32l) is a concern.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fell heavily in a chase last time; cheekpieces are enlisted for this return to hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: Won over the extended 2m7f in a chase at Newcastle in December and stays 3m1f, but easily the best of his three runs since saw him take a heavy fall two out on latest outing; cheekpieces are enlisted for this return to hurdling (he's 1-15 in this sphere) and he needs to be at his best.
Horse quote: 2024-12-14 at Newcastle (23.5f): "I didn't really want to make the running. Watchoutitscookie has a tendency to go to his right, but as long as you don't fight him, he's pretty straightforward that way. So I made the running on him, he's jumped well, and he's done it well - Lorcan Murtagh, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Respected on form last spring; needs major revival with his tongue tied for the first time
🔦 Spotlight: Respected on form last spring, including his win off 2lb higher in a big field at Hereford (3m2f, good to soft); however, pulled up last June and soundly beaten in his two starts this winter, so needs a major revival with his tongue tied for the first time.
