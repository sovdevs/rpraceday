💬 Comment: Resurgent 9yo who has won at Catterick last twice and he remains well treated on old form
🔦 Spotlight: Has been resurgent after wind surgery and he's won at Catterick (2m3f, soft/good to soft) in the last two of his three runs for current yard; up another 5lb but he scored with some authority last time and remains well treated on old form; key player.

💬 Comment: Has form figures of 13232 since last May and he's respected back form a break
🔦 Spotlight: Relatively lightly raced 9yo; made his breakthrough in a Market Rasen handicap (2m5f, good) last May and he's held his form with four placed efforts since; nudged up 2lb for his second at Ayr in November but he still looks feasibly treated and is respected back from a break.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Sedgefiled but flopped under a penalty at Newcastle; runner-up Sedgefield Thursday
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark with a front-running win at Sedgefield (2m4f, good to soft) last month but he flopped under a penalty at Newcastle eight days later; that may have come too soon but he has a patchy record and needs to kick on again to defy this mark; made the running before collared by odds-on shot at Sedgefield yesterday.

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 6yo and she looks a possible 🚀 improver on this drop back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Well held at single-figure odds in her three qualifying runs; started her handicap career with a seventh of eight here (3m, good to soft) last month but she ran well for a long way and wasn't beaten far; still has potential after only six starts and she's in the mix on this drop back in trip; cheekpieces worn last time are removed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won by 10l at Perth in September but has form figures of 86686 since
🔦 Spotlight: Won by 10l in first-time cheekpieces at Perth (2m4f, good) in September but he's finished down the field in five subsequent runs; now back on last winning mark but he's hard to predict and needs another bolt from the blue.
