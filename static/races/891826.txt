🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well backed and won easily on this month's stable debut; up 6lb but looks promising at 5f
🔦 Spotlight: Enthusiastic sprinter; heavily backed on stable debut at Bath three weeks ago (5f, good to firm) and overcame a tardy start to win decisively; the handicapper hasn't missed him with a 6lb rise but the way he travelled through that Bath contest offers hope of better; previous AW efforts lag behind his turf best but that could just be coincidence (sire has a higher strike-rate on AW than turf); strong claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Right up there with best form when making all to win easily at Bath last week; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from a seven-month absence to record an impressive front-running success at Bath last week (just 1lb shy of her peak RPR); doesn't have to lead and her record for Oisin Murphy reads 2319241; big run can be expected under a 5lb penalty.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Sandown (5f): "We've spent all year trying to get Lil Guff to win. Oisin had us worried halfway through. They were going too quickly and he was right to take back. He just needed the gap and you always need a bit of luck against that rail. She's won seven times so you can't complain but she needs quick ground and she's just never really had it this year. She's in at Ascot but we'll see how she is in the morning - Daniel Kubler, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two-time C&D winner; first turf win at Nottingham this month; still feasibly treated
🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins last year; running okay on AW over the winter but he dropped in the weights and returned to form with a Nottingham success 18 days ago (5f, good; front pair clear); with the short-priced favourite refusing to race, that may not have been the strongest form but a 3lb rise is manageable; Sean Levey, who rode both Robert Cowell's last-time-out winners, is on Tourist this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Won first two starts in emphatic fashion (6f; heavy and AW) before coming up short on her handicap debut at Kempton in October; 🔍 unexposed and dropping to 5f may suit but others are more appealing in today's field.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three AW wins, all at Newcastle; had excuses last time but others look better treated
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins, all at Newcastle, with the latest coming last month off a 6lb lower mark; not seen to best effect 17 days ago over 6f but it's likely that others in this field are better treated.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "They weren't the tactics we really wanted to employ but Monks Dream did the same thing the last day, he just rushed the gates before they opened. In a race like that over five furlongs when you miss the beat you're going to be held up. The way the race worked out, perhaps if he was handy he might not have finished as well as he did. Now let's see if he can transfer that form to grass - Sean Kirrane, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: On a dangerous mark and fully effective on Tapeta; sharper for return; each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: Was a smart sprint handicapper for David O'Meara on his day; encouraging debut for this stable at Newcastle on reappearance; type to win races this year but perhaps not this one.
Horse quote: 2019-07-13 at Navan (5f): "It was very easy. I think five furlongs is going to be the key to him, I don't think he stays six really. We've bounced and done things right. I'm not sure if it was much of a maiden but he gave me a nice feel today. He was behind some proper horses in maidens. Even though he wasn't getting near to them it was proper, nearly top-class, form in the book - Donnacha O'Brien, rider"

🔦 Spotlight: Took well to Tapeta last autumn, winning at Newcastle (5f) in between runner-up finishes here (5f and 6f); poorly drawn when down the field on recent Beverley return; a step forward is needed but he could yet fare better on this surface.
Horse quote: 2024-08-31 at Beverley (5f): "Spirit Of Applause is a very strong-travelling horse and when he hits the front he just does enough. When he puts his best foot forward he's very effective - Sean Kirrane, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Boasted some strong handicap form on Tapeta in 2024 and he now has a lower mark than when only just missing out over C&D and at Newcastle; some late headway on his seasonal return three weeks ago but insufficient promise to earn him the vote in this field.
Horse quote: 2020-07-09 at York (5f): "Muker's form has worked out well and he'll go for the Molecomb in three weeks. He's all speed - but for a horse with so much speed he has a great mind. - Paul Mulrennan, rider"
