🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner when last seen in this sphere and arrives on the back of a creditable Flat effort at the Curragh last month; that should put her spot on for her hurdle return and surely more to come in this sphere having just her fourth start over timber.

🔦 Spotlight: 1-34 over jumps and was tailed off over fences here when last seen; good chance he'll need this first run since 2023.
Horse quote: 2021-03-25 at Cork (20f): "Takarengo is a very good jumper but he can lose lengths at times and I'm not sure if hurdling is for him. If the owner wants to run him at Punchestown or somewhere like that then maybe we can look at that but I think the main target is the Cesarewitch, which he was third in last year. There's a few nice pots between now and then and he needs a bit of nice ground, he's not a good-to-firm ground horse. He was in real good order and today was his day to win a race over hurdles - Tom Mullins, trainer."
