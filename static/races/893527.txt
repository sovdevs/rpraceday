🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner at Wolverhampton last three starts; ended a long losing run last month and probably bettered that performance when second 11 days later; there was a heavy defeat over C&D four starts back but she's back in the good books now.

🔦 Spotlight: All three wins were in 2023, two over C&D; inconsistent since, for instance placed twice from six starts in the current winter/autumn campaign but none of those races were at Southwell and it's possible that the return here will receive a positive response.

💬 Comment: Often front-runner; two wins here this year; not ruled out despite a lesser show last time
🔦 Spotlight: Often front-runner and ridden since October by Elle-May Croot; last four wins have been at this track, two this year, and he's not ruled out despite a lesser show here 12 days ago.
Horse quote: 2022-12-13 at Southwell (AW) (11f): "It was a furlong shorter today and Lednikov needed every stride, but Joey gave him a great ride. The horse is very genuine, he gives his best all the time, and he's versatile - Ivan Furtado, trainer."

💬 Comment: Plenty of competitive shows at this track, latest three starts ago, but others appeal more
🔦 Spotlight: His three wins here were in the old Fibresand days and he's not scored anywhere since September 2023; plenty of competitive shows at this track, the latest three starts ago, and his usual tongue-tie (absent last time) returns but others appeal more for win purposes.
Horse quote: 2023-09-12 at Leicester (10f): "Bay Of Naples was suited by the way the race was run today. They got racing a long way out before coming back to him and he stayed on well ? he gets a bit further. Connor (Planas) hasn't panicked and gave him a lovely ride - Michael Herrington, trainer."
