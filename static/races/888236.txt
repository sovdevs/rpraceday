💬 Comment: Won going away in C&D contest last month, taking hurdles record to 23111; improving 6yo
🔦 Spotlight: Won going away in C&D contest (good to soft) three weeks ago, proving suited by the new trip (first  attempt beyond 2m) and taking hurdles form figures to 23111; improving 6yo who could well defy another rise in the weights.
