üí¨ Comment: Runner-up the last twice and this lightly raced 7yo could continue to improve
üî¶ Spotlight: Runner-up here (2m6f, good to soft) in December and short-headed at Haydock (2m5f, soft) in January, when clear of the third; also effective on good ground; he's up 5lb since last time but this lightly raced 7yo is in good hands to continue to improve and features prominently in calculations.

üí¨ Comment: Won by 11l at Ayr following wind surgery and a 9lb rise may not stop him
üî¶ Spotlight: Showed the benefit of wind surgery when getting off the mark at Ayr (2m, soft) a fortnight ago; scored by 11l and this former 3m pointer (placed in that sphere) could be fine now back up in trip; a 9lb rise may not stop him if he can back up that latest performance.

üî¶ Spotlight: 10yo who has had an inconsistent season but he's won on the last two occasions he's worn these cheekpieces, which were over C&D (good) last September and under Paddy Barlow at Doncaster (2m5f, good) last Friday; a 4lb rise isn't harsh and he could be firmly involved once more.

üí¨ Comment: Down to a dangerous mark but this 10yo hasn't been competitive this season
üî¶ Spotlight: He's dropped to a mark 7lb lower than when winning at Newcastle (2m4f, heavy) last March and is one to watch in the betting; however, this 10yo has been unable to get competitive across his five starts this season and needs to turn things around; testing ground may be preferable.
