🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up the last twice and this lightly raced 7yo could continue to improve
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up here (2m6f, good to soft) in December and short-headed at Haydock (2m5f, soft) in January, when clear of the third; also effective on good ground; he's up 5lb since last time but this lightly raced 7yo is in good hands to continue to improve and features prominently in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won by 11l at Ayr following wind surgery and a 9lb rise may not stop him
🔦 Spotlight: Showed the benefit of wind surgery when getting off the mark at Ayr (2m, soft) a fortnight ago; scored by 11l and this former 3m pointer (placed in that sphere) could be fine now back up in trip; a 9lb rise may not stop him if he can back up that latest performance.

🔦 Spotlight: Enjoying a consistent season, going close over C&D (good to soft) in November in this visor and winning at Musselburgh (2m4f, good to soft) last month in cheekpieces; up 5lb since last time and a career best is needed, but he has a steadily 📈 progressive profile and is entitled to respect.
