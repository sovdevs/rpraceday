🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reached the frame in two 2yo runs, with RPR of 77 on both occasions; respected on return
🔦 Spotlight: Reached the frame in two 7f soft-ground maidens in September and his latest third at Newmarket was behind an impressive winner who ran respectably in a Group 1 next time; both pieces of form put him firmly in the picture and he's respected on return.

🔦 Spotlight: 280,000euros (breeze-up) 2yo; 50-1 for Kempton debut (7f, Polytrack) in October but he made some striking late headway into third and that was behind a useful rival; should be more streetwise this time and he needs a close look on his return.
