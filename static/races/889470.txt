üí¨ Comment: Disappointing on stable debut at Ascot but this lightly raced 7yo was promising previously
üî¶ Spotlight: 2-2 over hurdles and won on chase debut for Nicky Henderson at Cheltenham (2m4f, good) in November; good third in hot handicap there (3m1f, good to soft) next time; his jumping lacked fluency when he tailed off in the Grade 2 Reynoldstown at Ascot (3m, good) on stable debut in February, but this lightly raced 7yo retains potential and is not written off.
