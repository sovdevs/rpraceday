💬 Comment: 9yo who has been better than ever in good handicaps at Doncaster the last twice; chance
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who has been inconsistent over the years but he's been better than ever the last twice, going very close at Doncaster (3m, good to soft) in December before winning another competitive handicap there (3m, good) in January, albeit having a battle on his hands before being left clear at the final fence; that latest form still reads well and a 4lb rise isn't harsh; chance.
