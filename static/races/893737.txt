🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive recent Leopardstown maiden winner; looks up to this step up in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Lope De Vega filly a 400,000gns yearling; third foal; half-sister to French 1m2f/1m3f Listed winner Grand Stars; dam unraced half-sister to winners High Heeled (1m4f Group 3) and Bella Estrella (1m Group 3) and to dam of Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Just The Judge; created good impression on recent Leopardstown fillies maiden debut over this trip, plenty green but travelling strongly and picking up nicely to go clear final furlong; looks up to this step up in grade.
Horse quote: 2025-04-09 at Leopardstown (10f): "Catalina Delcarpio is a nice filly. She was just ready to start and most of mine on debut can be green and she was, but I thought if we would have a first-time-out maiden winner this year it could be her. She trains very well and finds everything very easy, and I just thought she might have enough class to carry her through. I told the owner last week I was going to put her in the Epsom Oaks and then I said I wasn't going to as it was too soon in her development. I have the Irish Oaks in mind for her - Paddy Twomey, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Leopardstown maiden winner should relish this longer trip; likely major player
🔦 Spotlight: Lope De Vega filly is three-parts sister to top-class mid-distance filly Tarnawa (Prix Vermeille, Prix de l'Opera, Breeders' Cup Turf), and half-sister to four-time Group 1 winner Tahiyra; dam 12f Listed winner; landed odds on debut last month under patient ride in 1m Leopardstown fillies maiden, never stronger than at the finish; expected to come on considerably for that, especially over this longer trip and likely major player.
Horse quote: 2025-03-30 at Leopardstown (8f): "That was a nice performance by Tarima and she'll learn a lot from it. Chris [Hayes, jockey] hadn't planned to sit quite so far back on her, but she just gets turned sideways when they came out of the stalls and he had to sit and do the right thing and ride her with confidence. She was a backward filly as a two-year-old and I didn't get to teach her that much - she was growing and developing. She's going to learn an awful lot from that race. I expect a lot of progress and hopefully she develops to be a stakes filly. I trained her two half-sisters to win seven Group Ones - Dermot Weld, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won Tipperary maiden on quick ground last summer but looked a bit exposed afterwards in Group company; nicely improved on recent seasonal return however in Park Express Stakes (Group 3) at the Curragh, coming home strongly into second over 1m; looks to be crying out for this trip and more improvement likely.

🔦 Spotlight: Solid placed form at Pattern level last year, notably twice placed in Curragh Group contests at 7f; Leopardstown comeback run over the same trip last month was disappointing and now takes a marked step up in distance with stamina concerns on breeding.
Horse quote: 2024-05-06 at Curragh (6f): "Barnavara was good. We worked her on softish ground the other day and I was delighted with her. She will probably like better ground. We might go to Ascot for the Albany and she might have a run before then - Jessica Harrington, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Plenty green at two; bred for this sort of trip and more; likely 🚀 improver
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a sister to high-class fillies Magical and Rhododendron; still looked green when winning Gowran fillies' maiden in September and again when under 2l off stablemate Whirl in Group 3 at the Curragh following month; should appreciate this longer trip and likely 🚀 improver.
Horse quote: 2024-10-22 at Curragh (8f): "Ronan said he thought Island Hopping came home very well. She will get a mile and a quarter easily and she should be a Group filly for next year - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good attitude for Curragh maiden win over this trip; big jump in class now
🔦 Spotlight: Placed three times for Pat Martin and took a nice step forward on second start for the Cromwell yard when upped to today's trip in Curragh maiden last month, keen and making much of running (soft); big step ⬆️ up in class here though.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Curragh (10f): "J M's Joy surprised me as it wasn't the plan to make the running, she kind of ended up there. I thought she went a good gallop and I wasn't sure whether she'd see it out over the trip but she was gutsy. She was fit and had a couple of runs, while she handled the ground well. It's a nice pot to win - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Showed a good attitude to get off the mark in a 1m Listowel maiden in September but disappointed following month under top-weight in nursery at Leopardstown on softer ground; seemingly plenty to find here.
