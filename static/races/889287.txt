🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Major 🚀 improver over 6f as 3yo, close 2nd to Spycatcher in French Group 3; more to come
🔦 Spotlight: Brought along steadily before showing his mettle in a Group 3 at Deauville (6f, very soft) in August, when losing out only narrowly to Spycatcher; finished further behind that rival in Group 1 at Ascot after, when he was again slowly away and didn't have the best of runs; has sprint potential but he doesn't always travel strongly and that, combined with a possible slow start, could cost him here.

💬 Comment: Very good 2nd in this race last year; in fine form on AW at 6f and 5f; solid chance
🔦 Spotlight: Group 3 winner in France as a 3yo and he started last season with an excellent second in this race (soft) when travelling strongly but run down late on by a top sprinter; his path took a grey turn later but he's been in fine fettle on the AW since being ✂️ gelded and having wind surgery and he'll be suited by the return to 6f; solid chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: High-class sprinter at 6f; tends to reproduce his best form on reappearance; solid chance
🔦 Spotlight: High-class sprinter who's very effective at Deauville and was able to see off James's Delight in a Group 3 there (6f, very soft) in August; finished a creditable sixth in Group 1 at Ascot later and, given he tends to reproduce his best form when fresh, he should be good for another strong show.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Suited by good to soft/soft; front-runs; well held on reappearance in this last year
🔦 Spotlight: Best form on good to soft and slower surfaces; genuine front-runner who tends to be at her best in the later months of the turf season and was well held, after rearing at the start, in this race last year (20-1).
