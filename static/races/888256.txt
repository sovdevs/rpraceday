🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second over 2m4f latest and on breeding he has every chance of staying this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Still a maiden but it was only his second run over fences when pushing an in-form rival close at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft); only 1lb higher and on breeding he has every chance of staying this new trip.

💬 Comment: C&D winner and solid effort off this mark when second at Warwick last time
🔦 Spotlight: Better chaser than hurdler and won by over 8l here last month; a 7lb rise didn't look too harsh and she duly ran well again at Warwick, finding only one too good (again on soft); enters the reckoning.

🔦 Spotlight: Well in with Safe Destination on their clash at Uttoxeter last October and has produced similar sort of form in his last three races, all 3m handicaps on slow ground (effective on good to soft); unlikely to be far away.
