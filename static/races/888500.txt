🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner last month and went close over C&D ten days ago; obvious contender
🔦 Spotlight: Dual C&D winner last month, latterly when just doing enough to thwart Daaris; gave another good account when close second over C&D ten days ago and is very likely to be right in the thick of things again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form over staying trips on Tapeta since the autumn and current mark is workable
🔦 Spotlight: In good form over staying trips on Tapeta since the autumn and was a C&D winner in December; lost out only narrowly to Mamdoh over C&D last month and did not have the race run to suit when dropped back to 1m4f at Lingfield recently; on a workable mark and has a big role to play.
