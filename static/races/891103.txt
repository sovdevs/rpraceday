💬 Comment: Third to stablemate Custom Taylor at Limerick 2 weeks ago; handles soft; sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Promise for this stable last season, twice runner-up in maiden hurdles at Tramore; tailed off on sole outing for Henry de Bromhead in January; didn't see out 3m on first run back with this yard when third to stablemate Custom Taylor at Limerick two weeks ago; handles soft; sets the standard.
