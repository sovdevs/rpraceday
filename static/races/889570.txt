🔦 Spotlight: Had a wind operation in November and he has shown the benefit with two wins this year, a 7f maiden at Kempton and then a handicap success at Wolverhampton (Sorbus third) where he was value for more than the winning margin; drop back in trip no problem and a 3lb rise looks fair; leading claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Huge chance if reproducing August's Newmarket third on his stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Standout effort for Brian Meehan as a 2yo came when third to the subsequent Dewhurst winner at Newmarket last August (front three clear); possible to excuse both nursery runs (caught wide on first occasion and soft ground on the second) and he's been dropped 5lb for them; sold for 20,000gns in October; interesting contender on stable debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up on final start for G Boughey in Jan but barely beaten a rival for current stable
🔦 Spotlight: Finished second of nine at Wolverhampton in January (first-time blinkers; final run for George Boughey) but he's beaten just one home in three runs for current stable; plenty to prove.
