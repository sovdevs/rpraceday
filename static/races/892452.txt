🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Much better chaser but trip/ground to suit and definite contender
🔦 Spotlight: Much better chaser, now rated 41lb above this hurdles mark; good run over hurdles two starts back when second over 2m4f at Fairyhouse and goes on this sort of ground; definite contender.
Horse quote: 2023-02-19 at Punchestown (25f): "Stealthy Tom ran a lovely race here last year and got a lovely patient ride from Simon. He's only eight and will be a nice horse for this game in the future - Enda Bolger, trainer."
