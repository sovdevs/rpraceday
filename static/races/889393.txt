🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner; seemingly amiss on hurdles debut but progressing now; leading player
🔦 Spotlight: Bred to be useful and won Bangor bumper last April; ran as if amiss on hurdles debut but he looks to be progressing now and took second behind an impressive odds-on shot in maiden at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) four weeks ago; shapes as if he'll stay this longer trip; leading player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in point then fifth in bumpers; has some potential and should make a hurdler
🔦 Spotlight: Second behind a useful rival in an Irish point before finishing fifth in two bumpers, fading when beaten 16l at Southwell on latest; still has some potential and should make a hurdler.

🔦 Spotlight: 4yo filly; low-grade Flat maiden; some improvement on third hurdles run when fourth of eight in maiden at Chepstow (2m3f, good), but that's poor form and she's not sure to stay this longer trip.
