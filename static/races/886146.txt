🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten 12l for British hurdles debut latest but one to take seriously in this small field
🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 over fences in Britain and he's well handicapped judged on much of that form, including here on soft; below that level off this mark when beaten 12l for British hurdles debut at Uttoxeter on latest outing but he's one to take seriously in this small field.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-18 under rules; return to hurdling, a longer trip and much softer ground could all help
🔦 Spotlight: 0-18 under rules and beaten a long way when cheekpieces were given a go at Fakenham on latest start, despite starting 5-4 favourite; it can all be argued that this return to hurdling (first time since June), a longer trip and much softer ground will all help.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-16 but he's often been competitive; first blinkers and back from chasing
🔦 Spotlight: 0-16 and needs to prove he can get the job done but he's often been competitive, was short-headed once at this track last winter and signed off last term was a second over 3m2f on heavy; reappeared with fair fourth in December and perhaps being tongue tied for the first time was the problem when tailed off 11 days ago; now he swaps usual cheekpieces for blinkers; also goes hurdling (instead of chasing) for first time since 2021.

💬 Comment: Won a point but 0-11 under rules; handicap performances unconvincing, latest on Sunday
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point but 0-11 under rules; handicap performances have been unconvincing and while his remote third over an extended 2m5f at Exeter on New Year's Day suggested that this sort of trip might be worth another attempt, he was always behind when trying it again at Chepstow on Sunday.

💬 Comment: Beaten 12l for British hurdles debut latest but one to take seriously in this small field
🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 over fences in Britain and he's well handicapped judged on much of that form, including here on soft; below that level off this mark when beaten 12l for British hurdles debut at Uttoxeter on latest outing but he's one to take seriously in this small field.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-16 and needs to prove he can get the job done but he's often been competitive, was short-headed once at this track last winter and signed off last term was a second over 3m2f on heavy; reappeared with fair fourth in December and perhaps being tongue tied for the first time was the problem when tailed off 11 days ago; now he swaps usual cheekpieces for blinkers; also goes hurdling (instead of chasing) for first time since 2021.

💬 Comment: Beaten 12l for British hurdles debut latest but one to take seriously in this small field
🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 over fences in Britain and he's well handicapped judged on much of that form, including here on soft; below that level off this mark when beaten 12l for British hurdles debut at Uttoxeter on latest outing but he's one to take seriously in this small field.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-16 and needs to prove he can get the job done but he's often been competitive, was short-headed once at this track last winter and signed off last term was a second over 3m2f on heavy; reappeared with fair fourth in December and perhaps being tongue tied for the first time was the problem when tailed off 11 days ago; now he swaps usual cheekpieces for blinkers; also goes hurdling (instead of chasing) for first time since 2021.
