🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won last February/March; revival needed after his two runs this winter, one for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Made all over about 3m here and at Ayr last February/March when first tried in cheekpieces, which have been kept since; left Sandy Thomson after a lacklustre performance in November and weakened into a modest third at Carlisle (3m2f, soft) for new trainer two months ago, so needs a revival.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4-8 here but not having gone much beyond 2m4f under rules asks a major question
🔦 Spotlight: All four of his wins were at Musselburgh (he's 4-8 here) with the first three at about 2m4f and the latest 2m (last January); his three completions this season have also been over 2m, placed on last two occasions, and not having gone much beyond 2m4f under rules asks a major question.

💬 Comment: Seemed to find 2m4f on the short side here on hat-trick bid but ran respectably
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wetherby (3m, good) and here (2m7f, good to soft) in November; seemed to find 2m4f here on the short side on latest outing but ran respectably and looks a strong candidate back up in trip today.
