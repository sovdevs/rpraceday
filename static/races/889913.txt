🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Naas fourth was disappointing following a fine Down Royal win, capable of getting involved
🔦 Spotlight: Built on a fair debut run with a commanding success for Sean Doyle in a Castlelands maiden last March; claimed a huge scalp when making almost all to beat Its On The Line (who was ridden from off the pace) at Down Royal; failed to uphold form with Its On The Line when a tame fourth at Naas; capable of getting involved if back on song.
