🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Listed mares' hurdle at Kelso last time and the handicapper may have been lenient
🔦 Spotlight: Won Aintree handicap (2m4f, good to soft) in December and improved for the step up to 3m to win a Listed mares' hurdle at Kelso (good to soft) three weeks ago by 9l; also effective on good ground; the handicapper has put her up just 6lb for last time, which could prove lenient.
Horse quote: 2025-03-22 at Kelso (24.5f): "We thought Lavida Adiva would like the longer trip and we thought if she stayed and could cope at this level we could look at a similar race at Ayr.  She never travelled or jumped on the ground last time, it was too tacky for her, and Charlie Maggs didn't give her a hard race, which I loved. As soon as I rode her on the Monday I thought 'you're coming here' - Ruth Jefferson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over the extended 2m5f here last time; this new trip could prompt another step forward
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well in defeat on first three starts for this yard before winning over the extended 2m5f here (soft) last month, which is the furthest she's been previously; also effective on good ground; today's further increase in distance could prompt another step forward and she's respected.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Ayr (21.5f): "Ruby Island has run consistent and well for me and it was nice to get her head in front. She's run decent races every time and she grounded it out well, although it was very testing ground. I have half a feeling she might step up in trip again. I might bring her back up here again for a 3m mares' handicap - Nicky Richards, trainer."

💬 Comment: Takes big step up in trip on h'cap debut but dam is a sister to a Midlands National winner
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper runner-up who returned from a long absence to win a maiden at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft) in February on her fourth hurdle start; takes a big step up in trip on handicap debut but she's in top hands and her dam is a sister to Midlands National winner Goulanes; could go well.
Horse quote: 2025-02-13 at Newcastle (17f): "I thought maybe it was a little fresher ground on the outside but up the home straight the horse in front was jumping to his right so I had to switch to challenge on the inside, which wasn't ideal. Armed And Fabulous had an injury since her last run and had been off for a long time but we had her pretty ready and she was tough - Patrick Mullins, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-11-02 at Ayr (24.5f): "Ottizzini was fantastic. I just went out there and rode her off the cusp and she really enjoyed it. She's jumped great and travelled great. She's very honest and very solid. We schooled her last week over fences and she was good there, so I'd imagine she'll have a go over them at some point - Daryl Jacob, jockey."
