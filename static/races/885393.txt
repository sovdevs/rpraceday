🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten about 10l on chase debut but ran well and the effort can be upgraded
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 but signed off over hurdles with a second of 15 here in October (2m3f, soft) when fitted with a hood that was retained when again making the frame on chase debut at Warwick (3m1f, good to soft); beaten a shade over 10l in the latter but he made up his ground quickly before weakening and the run can be upgraded; headgear left off here but perhaps it's unwise to read much into that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Long absences in his career and back from another; ability respected; chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Had a mammoth absence after winning his Irish point in May 2021 but ran second to high-class The Jukebox Man on his belated comeback before promoted to first in a 2m3f maiden hurdle here (heavy); later pulled up on his handicap debut and that was 12 months ago, but this 9yo could still have a future over fences; market could be useful.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second on chase debut over C&D; aided by another low weight, should have a part to play
🔦 Spotlight: Won her only point; handicap hurdle win came off 2lb higher and she ran two solid races in that discipline before finding only one too good on her switch to fences over C&D 12 days ago (heavy); aided by another low weight, she should have a part to play.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a heavy-ground maiden hurdle last season (2m4f) but has been a long way below that form in three runs after a long break, the latest when pulled up on his chase debut; should be fine over this far with his pointing background but comes with risks right now.

💬 Comment: Beaten about 10l on chase debut but ran well and the effort can be upgraded
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 but signed off over hurdles with a second of 15 here in October (2m3f, soft) when fitted with a hood that was retained when again making the frame on chase debut at Warwick (3m1f, good to soft); beaten a shade over 10l in the latter but he made up his ground quickly before weakening and the run can be upgraded; headgear left off here but perhaps it's unwise to read much into that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten about 10l on chase debut but ran well and the effort can be upgraded
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 but signed off over hurdles with a second of 15 here in October (2m3f, soft) when fitted with a hood that was retained when again making the frame on chase debut at Warwick (3m1f, good to soft); beaten a shade over 10l in the latter but he made up his ground quickly before weakening and the run can be upgraded; headgear left off here but perhaps it's unwise to read much into that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second on chase debut over C&D; aided by another low weight, should have a part to play
🔦 Spotlight: Won her only point; handicap hurdle win came off 2lb higher and she ran two solid races in that discipline before finding only one too good on her switch to fences over C&D 12 days ago (heavy); aided by another low weight, she should have a part to play.
