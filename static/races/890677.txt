💬 Comment: Wide-margin 7f winner at Southwell in January; back on better mark again; surface query
🔦 Spotlight: Back to best when coming well clear at Southwell (7f) in January and although unable to compete after going smartly back up the weights she fared better at Southwell (1m) recently until stamina gave out; the return to 7f will suit but she needs to show she's as effective on Polytrack.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Multiple wins but on a long losing AW run and has her work cut out again
🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner, the latest three on turf in 2024, but she hasn't won on the AW for nearly three years and recent runs on sand suggest she has her work cut out again.
Horse quote: 2021-12-31 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "We were umming and ahing over whether the drop back to six furlongs would suit, but Alcazan has enjoyed that and bowled along nicely. I did think at one point we were tapping a bit too soon but I managed to get a breather into her at the three-furlong pole and she's gone on again round the bend - Laura Coughlan, jockey."
