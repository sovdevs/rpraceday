💬 Comment: Clear second to well-handicapped winner at Huntingdon; major player if seeing out the trip
🔦 Spotlight: Good-ground bumper runner-up who ran his best race yet over hurdles when clear second at Huntingdon (2m, good to soft) last month on his second handicap start, and that form has received a firm boost from the winner; stamina to prove today but he's a major player if seeing it out.

💬 Comment: Step back in right direction when fourth of 15 at Uttoxeter and he's respected
🔦 Spotlight: Won last season on first three rules starts; failed to threaten this term in his first three handicaps but took step back in right direction when fourth of 15 at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) last month; respected.
Horse quote: 2024-03-16 at Uttoxeter (20f): "Below The Radar is very tough and did it easily enough in the end. He's a versatile horse. He's not the quickest in the world but has a good attitude - Freddie Gingell, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good 3rd off this mark at Wetherby last time and he's one to consider for his in-form yard
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 11 times since winning juvenile hurdle in October 2023 but he returned to form when third at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in February; also effective on good/good to soft ground; the first-time cheekpieces may help him travel better; one to consider for in-form yard off the same mark as last time.
Horse quote: 2023-10-14 at Chepstow (16f): "It's taken a while for the penny to drop. Balboa has had two runs but he still had a look at the first (hurdle). We got a bit of good fortune with the non-runners but that's racing and you've got to kick the ball when it's in front of you. He's ok and he's solid, he seems to handle the soft ground. We might turn up at the Cheltenham meeting in November, although we do have some higher rated who could go there. Milton Harris, trainer"

Horse quote: 2023-11-05 at Carlisle (17f): "Dunnet Head is a nice horse with a nice future, he's a three-mile chaser in the making. The wind operation has probably made a small difference. That was only his fourth run so there's plenty more improvement - Iain Jardine, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Remains a maiden after 17 starts but just five of those have been over hurdles and she ran well from the front on her handicap debut in this code when second over C&D (soft) in February; fair fifth of 19 at Down Royal (2m4f, good) since when inconvenienced by jumping to the left, and she could play a leading role now back at a left-handed track.
