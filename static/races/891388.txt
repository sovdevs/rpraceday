🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent comeback second makes him the one to beat if handling quicker ground
🔦 Spotlight: Solid effort on debut when second in Clonmel bumper in April 2023 (heavy) and absent for 690 days until fine effort in the circumstances when a clear second behind a smart type in 2m4f Punchestown maiden hurdle last month on similar ground; longer trip should be no problem and likely the one to beat if handling quicker ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Sligo bumper winner on good ground; 0-6 over hurdles but has run well in defeat including on recent return from 212-day absence when staying on third behind a ready winner in 2m4f Leopardstown maiden; sure to be thereabouts but weight concession makes it tough.
