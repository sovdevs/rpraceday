🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seeking to win this race for the third consecutive season and he's the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Won this in 2023 on his reappearance (good to soft) and last year on his second start of the campaign (good to soft); also effective on fast ground; mixed form subsequently last season but ran well in the Group 1 Prix du Cadran in October when last seen; the one to beat on his return.
Horse quote: 2024-05-01 at Ascot (16f): "I think there was a concern whether the fire was still there, but I think it certainly was. I think Coltrane was in front longer than Oisin probably wanted to be but he was really brave there at the end. Maybe the cheekpieces sparked him up today, but he really looked well and maybe he just wasn't himself in Meydan. He's just come to himself now and he's a fighter. He loves Ascot and has run one bad race here and that's it. We'll look forward to coming back here in June. He does his own thing at home, which is not very much in the mornings. We'll let him do his own thing and he will train himself for the Gold Cup, as he did the same last year and he ran a stellar race - Andrew Balding, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went very close in 1m6f Listed race on reappearance; could build on that now back up to 2m
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive in handicaps in both the last seasons and went close in the Ascot Stakes at the Royal meeting last June (2m4f, good to firm); reappeared with close Listed second at Nottingham (1m6f, good) three weeks ago and could build on that performance now back up in trip; in calculations.
Horse quote: 2024-05-25 at Haydock (16f): "I hadn't thought beyond today because two miles on this ground is a very different kettle of fish to two miles at Kempton but Divine Comedy loved the ground and the trip. The Ascot Stakes came to mind, black type will come into it at some point and the handicapper will have his say. Something like the Doncaster Cup could be a race for her down the line - Harry Eustace, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Coltrane has stronger form but he can go well fresh and is not ruled out on stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: 1m6f Group 3 winner in Ireland for Jessica Harrington; changed hands for 80,000gns last October and has had wind op since; something to find if Coltrane is at his best and stamina for 2m isn't guaranteed, but he can go well fresh and is not ruled out making his stable debut in a first-time tongue-tie.
Horse quote: 2023-05-19 at Leopardstown (14f): "Yashin will have to go up a bit to get to the Melbourne Cup, but he stays well and he has to have good ground. He probably likes going left-handed too. He was hung wide and keen all the way there. Shane said he really had no right to pick up and win like he did. I know it was only a short head but he was always getting there - Jessica Harrington, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bottom of this pack on form but very lightly raced and he may have staying potential
🔦 Spotlight: Bottom of this pack on form but this 4yo is very lightly raced and the way he kept on for fourth in a 1m4f Group 3 at Newbury on his reappearance (good; beaten just over 6l) hinted he may have staying potential.
Horse quote: 2023-10-25 at Newmarket (8f): "Feigning Madness never looked like winning as he was just green. He looked green at Newbury and fell in a bit. He did the same today. He is a nice horse to win under a penalty as that takes a bit of doing. He surprised us at Newbury and I didn't think he would know enough, that is why I started him over seven furlongs. He galloped right out to the line. Next year he will want all of a mile and a half. I think we will end up rolling the dice with a nice race in the spring and see how he goes - Ralph Beckett, trainer."
