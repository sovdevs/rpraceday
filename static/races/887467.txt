🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner over 7f; just 2-41 but has run well the last twice; claims
🔦 Spotlight: Refused to enter stalls on latest intended start; both wins came in 0-50 classified events over 7f on Polytrack early last year, including one here; record of 2-41 hardly compelling, but he comes into this off the back of fair thirds at Wolverhampton (7f, Tapeta) and Kempton (1m); claims.
