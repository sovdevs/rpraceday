🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Musselburgh (3m) in December and by 16l at Newcastle (extended 2m4f) last Thursday
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Musselburgh (3m) in December and by 16l at Newcastle (extended 2m4f) last Thursday, both from the front on good to soft; disappointing in his two runs in between but he'd have a huge chance under this penalty if that form from last week (a narrow career best) is repeated.

🔦 Spotlight: Won here last April and registered his second handicap win when comfortably in front at Hereford (3m2f, good to soft) in December; the latter was his first attempt at this sort of trip but he flopped when 7-4 favourite at Wincanton five weeks ago; major player if bouncing straight back.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back hurdling with a win at Southwell (2m4f) in November; unraced beyond 2m5f under rules
🔦 Spotlight: Hurdles winner here in 2023; well held in two chases this autumn but reverted to hurdling with a win at Southwell (2m4f) in November, travelling best before asserting close home; off since and 6lb higher today, and he's unraced beyond 2m5f under rules, but keeping away from soft ground is seemingly a help.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won by wide margin in maiden at Catterick (3m1f, good to soft) ten days ago; 7lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: 7-11 in points; it took him a long time to get off the mark under rules but he did so by wide margin in seven-runner maiden hurdle at Catterick (3m1f, good to soft) ten days ago; he has a 7lb penalty today (with a 7lb-claiming amateur enlisted) but is due to go back up by just 1lb; penultimate start was poor, which is another niggling worry.

🔦 Spotlight: Yet to replicate his bumper form (he won here last April) over hurdles but it's still early days and he was made favourite when pulled up on handicap debut here (2m4f) in December, with connections blaming the soft ground; tongue tied first time; could be interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7th of 17 at Doncaster last time was easily the most positive of three runs this winter
🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing since he won twice over hurdles from markedly higher marks in spring 2021; seventh of 17 at Doncaster latest start was easily the most positive of his three runs this winter, however; needs to build on that, with blinkers replacing his recent cheekpieces.
