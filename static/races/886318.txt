💬 Comment: Behind Star Of Guiting but still displayed considerable promise when third on debut
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a fairly useful Flat/hurdle winner; unable to justify warm favouritism but still displayed considerable promise before fading into third (nearly 4l behind Star Of Guiting) at Newbury (2m, soft) last month; could be hard to beat here if that run has brought him on.

🔦 Spotlight: Half-sister to connections' very useful chaser Pink Legend; 5-4 favourite for debut at Ludlow in December but did not look straightforward and was struggling to keep up from a fairly early stage; presumably thought capable of much better but some of today's rivals look much less risky.
