🔦 Spotlight: Made breakthrough over hurdles for Victor Dartnall with game win at Fontwell (2m6f, soft) last January on handicap debut; unseated early on chase debut and ran poorly when upped to 3m1f in May when last seen, but he could still have more to offer for new yard; one to check for market support.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m6f winner; could still have more to offer for new yard; one to check for market support
🔦 Spotlight: Made breakthrough over hurdles for Victor Dartnall with game win at Fontwell (2m6f, soft) last January on handicap debut; unseated early on chase debut and ran poorly when upped to 3m1f in May when last seen, but he could still have more to offer for new yard; one to check for market support.
