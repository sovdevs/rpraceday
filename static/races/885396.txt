🔦 Spotlight: Made breakthrough over hurdles for Victor Dartnall with game win at Fontwell (2m6f, soft) last January on handicap debut; unseated early on chase debut and ran poorly when upped to 3m1f in May when last seen, but he could still have more to offer for 🆕 new yard; one to check for market support.

🔦 Spotlight: Won once over hurdles and fences (3m2f) for Robert Walford; five starts for this yard, easily best of them when second at Exeter (near 2m6f, soft) on New Year's Day after 11 months off; that was followed by a heavy defeat over that same C&D 12 days later but this longer trip should help.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-10 under rules; handicaps unconvincing; staying trip may be worth this fourth attempt
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point but 0-10 under rules; handicap performances have been unconvincing but penultimate start (remote third over an extended 2m5f) suggested that this sort of trip may be worth this fourth attempt.

🔦 Spotlight: Out of form in his two races (fences and hurdles) in late 2023 and, after a year off, no sign of turning things around in his two starts this winter; cheekpieces (tried once two years ago) are given another go.

🔦 Spotlight: Won once over hurdles and fences (3m2f) for Robert Walford; five starts for this yard, easily best of them when second at Exeter (near 2m6f, soft) on New Year's Day after 11 months off; that was followed by a heavy defeat over that same C&D 12 days later but this longer trip should help.
