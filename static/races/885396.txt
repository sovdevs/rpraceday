🔦 Spotlight: Made breakthrough over hurdles for Victor Dartnall with game win at Fontwell (2m6f, soft) last January on handicap debut; unseated early on chase debut and ran poorly when upped to 3m1f in May when last seen, but he could still have more to offer for new yard; one to check for market support.

🔦 Spotlight: Won once over hurdles and fences (3m2f) for Robert Walford; five starts for this yard, easily best of them when second at Exeter (near 2m6f, soft) on New Year's Day after 11 months off; that was followed by a heavy defeat over that same C&D 12 days later but this longer trip should help.

🔦 Spotlight: Sole hurdles win (16 races) was in 2021 but five wins since from 17 starts over fences, including three over 3m-3m2f last spring; thrown in on that form but there's been no sign of it in his three attempts since five-month break and this is his first hurdle race for over two years.

💬 Comment: Out of form for Anthony Charlton lately; headgear removed on this debut for new stable
🔦 Spotlight: Twice second off higher marks over 3m2f last May but soundly beaten on all four starts for Anthony Charlton this autumn/winter, two of them over fences; tried various headgear last six outings but it's removed today on debut for new stable.
