🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-13 but runner-up here in his last three starts; doesn't need much more in order to win
🔦 Spotlight: 0-13 under rules and becoming frustrating having finished runner-up with cheekpieces enlisted here in his last three starts, the last two over C&D including a half-length defeat by Cosmic View; cheekpieces off this time; likely to go well again and he doesn't need much more in order to get his head in front.

💬 Comment: 0-14; second to an in-form rival at Lingfield in January but disappointing there next time
🔦 Spotlight: 0-14 and his second of ten at Lingfield (1m4f, Polytrack; first-time cheekpieces) in January came in a very slowly run race, albeit with the winner handsomely advertising the form since; disappointing when sent off favourite back there (1m2f) last month; needs to bounce back.
