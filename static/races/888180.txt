🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gr 1 Fillies' Mile winner; unbeaten; sparkled in racecourse gallop last month; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Godolphin filly whose unbeaten 2yo campaign comprised four wins by an aggregate of almost 17l, the last two in the May Hill at Doncaster (good) and Group 1 Fillies' Mile at this venue (good to soft); sparkled in a racecourse gallop here last month and commands major respect.
Horse quote: 2024-10-11 at Newmarket (8f): "I see no reason not to do that [go straight to 1,000 Guineas], as Desert Flower won't take much to get fit. She's a scopey filly but you'd love to see her put a few kilos on during the winter. We probably haven't had the fillies for a little while, but she's always pleased us. We were confident with her in her maiden and she's just kept pleasing us all the way throughout. She's not an exciting filly in the morning, but the way she does stuff and pulls up at the end of her gallop, it's like she hasn't done anything. She paraded very well and she's got a head that means hopefully she'll have something to think about over the winter. She'll be a more mature filly in the spring - Charlie Appleby, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: The top European-trained 2yo filly of 2024 having won Group/Grade 1 races at 6f-1m, namely the Moyglare at the Curragh (good), Cheveley Park Stakes at this track (soft) and Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf at Del Mar (firm); still unbeaten (5-5) and holds leading claims.
Horse quote: 2024-11-01 at Del Mar (8f): "It was an incredible performance. Lake Victoria looks very special. Ryan was very cool on her - he probably ended up further back than he wanted to be. She'd only ever run over straight tracks before and it was her first time over a mile, and Ryan gave her a brilliant ride - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid form at the Curragh; ties in closely with Lake Victoria on two efforts; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Frankel filly whose very solid 2yo form at the Curragh (7f, good) comprises an impressive maiden win and two efforts that tie her in closely with Lake Victoria, latest in the Moyglare Stud Stakes when running well despite traffic issues; 🔥 big player with further progress on the cards.
Horse quote: 2024-07-21 at Curragh (7f): "Red Letter did what we probably expected. She stepped forward nicely from her debut. We will see how she comes out of it. It's just raw ability at the moment. She will tell me where we go with her, whether she comes back for the Moyglare or something like that - Ger Lyons, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Emphatic winner of the Fred Darling; frame possibilities, provided she stays the new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Supplemented for this race at a cost of £30,000 having belied her 33-1 odds with an emphatic success in the Fred Darling at Newbury (7f, good) on seasonal debut; has frame possibilities, provided she stays the new trip (not guaranteed on breeding).
Horse quote: 2025-04-12 at Newbury (7f): "Duty First will definitely go over a mile in the 1,000 Guineas. I haven't got her in entered at Newmarket, but I'd imagine that's where she'd run. She was actually scheduled to go for the Italian Guineas, but I don't think that'll happen now. - Archie Watson, trainer."

💬 Comment: Consistent last season but was twice beaten by Desert Flower; needs to have wintered well
🔦 Spotlight: Proved very consistent (22133) last season and her Sandown maiden win is flanked by good efforts in races won by Desert Flower, including the May Hill; however, she looks unlikely to reverse the placings unless she has wintered particularly well.
Horse quote: 2024-09-12 at Doncaster (8f): "Flight travelled well. Oisin [Murphy, rider] was very happy and felt she quickened well the whole way to the line. I'd say she was just beaten by two very good fillies. She's run her race, which was a very good race. She's a big filly, she's going to keep improving. She'll either be finished for the year or we might think about the Fillies' Mile or something. She'll be one for next year, when she'll go up in trip - Ollie Sangster, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very useful last year but form dipped sharply in the Fred Darling on reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful filly whose solid 2yo campaign featured Group wins over 6f/7f in Britain/France and a good second to Lake Victoria in Irish Group 1; form dipped sharply in the Fred Darling on reappearance, which isn't ideal going into this Classic.
Horse quote: 2024-08-17 at Deauville (7f): "It was an easier watch than the Princess Margaret. Dylan [Browne McMonagle] said Simmering probably hit the front a bit soon but he didn't have anything else to take him into the race, and she maybe looked a round a bit. I think she will be a better filly on better ground but she seemed to handle it okay here today. This is only my second ever foreign runner and she's my first Group 2 winner so it's nice to have a flagbearer like that in the yard. I think she's still progressive, she's a big filly and it's exciting. Seven furlongs was a new trip today, which she saw it out well. It's her fourth run of the season and I don't think we'll go to the well too many more times this year. She likes the quick ground and we'll give the Breeders' Cup strong consideration - Ollie Sangster, trainer."

Horse quote: 2025-04-15 at Newmarket (7f): "We were pleased with that and we feel Remaat will be suited by an extra furlong. She'd been off a while and enjoyed the ground - Andrew Balding, trainer."

Horse quote: 2025-04-12 at Newbury (7f): "It'll be straight to the Guineas. I'm delighted with her. It was Hey Boo's first time on the grass after two wins on the all-weather and she'll come on a ton. She'll improve for the mile and I wouldn't swap her - Jack Channon, trainer."
