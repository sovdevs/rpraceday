🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recaptured some form of late and this looks weaker than his recent third over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Most recent win in July 2022; had a disconcerting year in 2024 but back in better form now and a close third over C&D last month came in a stronger classified than this; widest draw but good form claims.

🔦 Spotlight: In good heart for 🆕 new yard and he did it nicely, if narrowly, when winning over 6f here last week; under a penalty this time but more of a problem may be the extra furlong as he hasn't appeared to relish it in the past.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not at best of late but good claims on best form this winter, including over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Good claims on the pick of his form since the autumn, gaining his first AW win here (about 1m) and just touched off in two 7f events since, including over C&D in December; has lost his way a touch since but he ought to figure in his first 7f classified event.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden; close second on rare 6f run in February; faded latest; trip query back at 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden; close second to Kapparis Kid on rare 6f run, at Southwell in February, but she did too much in front when fading there since and the return to 7f raises big questions; blinkers the last twice, cheekpieces now.
