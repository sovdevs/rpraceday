💬 Comment: Starman colt cost 80,000euros; freshman sire has already had an impressive 2yo winner
🔦 Spotlight: Starman colt an 80,000euros yearling; second foal; dam Listed-placed 5f winner (RPR 99), half-sister to winners War Of Succession (8.4f/1m2f) and Tommy De Vito (useful 6f); freshman sire has already had an impressive 2yo winner; looks the more likely of the Murtagh pair.
