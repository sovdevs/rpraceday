🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close on hurdling debut and last month's Wetherby fifth was perfectly respectable
🔦 Spotlight: Went very close on hurdling debut at Ayr (2m4f, soft) in January and put a lesser effort behind her when very respectable fifth at Wetherby (2m3f, good) last month, only fading out of contention on the run-in; raced a bit too freely last time so this drop in trip could be a good move in the short term; wears first-time tongue-tie; features prominently in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairly useful on the Flat but last month's stable/hurdle debut was rather disappointing
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful on the Flat at up to 2m for Harry Eustace but made rather disappointing stable/hurdle debut when well-held fifth at Doncaster (2m, good) last month and will need to take a good step forward here.
Horse quote: 2023-09-18 at Brighton (12f): "Newbury was a sort of fact-finding mission and we were pleasantly surprised Plus Point was up to winning over a mile and a quarter. We hoped there was improvement up to a mile and a half but, especially against one of Sir Mark's without a penalty, it was a bit of a question. She did it nicely. We were very much on weather watch. I think probably it was a two-way swing in that Sir Mark didn't want rain and we did. The ground is very much as important a factor to her as the trip. This is her time of year now and I hope she continues to improve - Harry Eustace, trainer."

💬 Comment: Made promising bumper debut in 2023 but well beaten in both bumpers this year
🔦 Spotlight: Quite promising fourth of 16 in soft-ground Warwick bumper in November 2023 but returned from long absence with two down-the-field bumper runs this year and has a lot to prove on this hurdling debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Won three-runner Flat maiden (7f, soft; RPR 72) for Peter Chapple-Hyam in October 2023 but, after a long absence, it's questionable what she achieved when second in small-field novice hurdle at Catterick (1m7f, good; 1-16 favourite fell) for new stable last month.
