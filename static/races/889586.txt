🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed on AW and respected in hat-trick bid from 3lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Only made his AW debut in January, but has made up for lost time by winning twice last month with a visor reapplied, firstly over C&D (66-1) and then under a 4lb penalty at Southwell (1m, Tapeta); respected in his hat-trick bid from 3lb higher.
