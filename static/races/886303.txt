🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His Ascot conqueror is Cheltenham-bound; that was a step up on his winning form
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who drew clear to win easily at Chepstow (good to soft) and stepped up again when second in a Listed race at Ascot behind Windbeneathmywings who is bound for Cheltenham; unlikely that he faces anything of his calibre here.

🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to the smart Go Dante; likely that he was inconvenienced by the steady pace when a keeping-on second in a Listed bumper at Cheltenham (soft), which was some effort by a newcomer; that might not have been a strong race for the grade and tackles older opposition this time, but he's promising.
