💬 Comment: Untested on good ground but was commendable third in valuable handicap in November
🔦 Spotlight: Gained his hurdling win at Chepstow (2m, good to soft) last spring; slightly disappointing when third of five at Hereford in January but was commendable third in valuable Haydock handicap (also 2m3f, soft) in November and will be tough to beat if okay on the forecast faster ground here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second twice (once over C&D) since Chepstow win in October; leading contender
🔦 Spotlight: Rewarded good market support when scoring at Chepstow (2m, soft) on seasonal/hurdle debut in October and came second on two of his three subsequent starts (once over C&D); unraced on ground faster than good to soft but has a big role to play if handling the conditions here.
