🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Thriving 7yo who cruised clear for wide-margin win at Hereford last month; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Thriving 7yo who cruised clear to win by 22l at Hereford (2m, good) last month, his third success this season; 10lb higher in a deeper race, but will be fine over the longer trip and needs to be taken very seriously in current mood.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Wincanton (15.5f): "Western General was very good. As soon as I got to the leader he pricked his ears, went on and won very nicely. This race was perfect as he's shown form on heavy ground and two miles is right for him. Hopefully we can find another nice race - Freddie Gingell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Returned to peak form when dominating from the front at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in December and has been placed on all three starts since; still on a workable mark and can make another bold bid.
Horse quote: 2024-12-18 at Newbury (20f): "Saint Segal owed us. He's behaving himself better but he's only six and needed to learn how to settle over the two-and-a-half-mile pace. He's switched off and just goes on so that's great - Jane Williams, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Rebounded from poor performance and went down fighting when second at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) last month; up in grade and 2lb higher but ran very well over C&D on both previous visits to Chepstow, more notably when winning by 3l on good ground a year ago.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way when sixth of 30 over the big Aintree fences this month
🔦 Spotlight: Well below best form this season, but came second off much-reduced mark at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft) in February and ran well for a long way when sixth of 30 over the big Aintree fences (2m5f, good to soft) this month; enters calculations.
Horse quote: 2023-10-29 at Aintree (20f): "This has been the target since the day we turned out Jetoile after winning at Chepstow. All he does is jump and travel. The fences being out has hopefully done us a favour with the handicapper. He has to either go for the Peterborough Chase or the December Gold Cup. I'd say at this moment in time we will probably go for the Peterborough, but we will enjoy today - Ryan Potter, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Slightly disappointing last time but this largely consistent 7yo is on a workable mark
🔦 Spotlight: Largely consistent 7yo who was runner-up three consecutive times after his Wincanton win (2m4f, good) in November; slightly below form when dropped back to 2m at Newbury last month but this move back up in trip will suit and his current mark is workable.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Wincanton (20f): "It was a brilliant ride. Beau Balko just needed the run at Kempton and he's improved like a lot of ours have and they'll only get fitter as the season goes along. Last season we couldn't drop him in as he was always too keen but we could over two and a half [miles] there - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Suited by the return to good ground when very respectable third of five at Ascot (2m1f, good; jumped left on occasions) three weeks ago; needs to build on that performance but remains on a good mark and ought to be better suited by this left-handed track.

🔦 Spotlight: Rewarded very positive ride and caused 33-1 surprise at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in February but was not quite in the same form when dropped back to 2m1f at Kelso last month; may need some rain here and others appeal more.
Horse quote: 2023-11-25 at Haydock (16.5f): "The race fell apart pretty dramatically, two of the others didn't run their race at all so you should take the form with a pinch of salt. But given our current form I'll take any win. There's nothing wrong, the horses just aren't absolutely ripping. We've probably got a few good days in Real Stone as he didn't do a lot of racing as a youngster. But under pressure he does go pretty violently left so that rules out Ascot and Kempton - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very well handicapped on old form but has not shown much for owner-trainer this season
🔦 Spotlight: Best known for his heroics at Newbury but is also suited by this track; very well handicapped on old form for Fergal O'Brien but, following a long absence, has not shown a great deal for his owner-trainer this season, including when back at Newbury last month; revival needed.
Horse quote: 2022-11-25 at Newbury (20f): "Paint The Dream is a lovely, lovely horse and he seems as good as ever. He ran a cracker at Wetherby last time and I think he's even improved again this season - he's filled out more and was bouncing in the parade ring. He could run at Cheltenham on either New Year's Day or the end of January, but we'll speak to the team. He can go on soft ground as well, not heavy though - Bob Preston, part-owner."
