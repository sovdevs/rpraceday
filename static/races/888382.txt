🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two wins in January but less good in two of his last three runs; others appeal more
🔦 Spotlight: Had a warm spell in January, winning twice, but he's been far less convincing in two of his last three starts; only 1lb higher than for the last win but others are more appealing in this field.
