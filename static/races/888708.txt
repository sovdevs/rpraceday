🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive this term, won 3 of last 4 and won with plenty in hand latest; 8lb rise fine
🔦 Spotlight: Has really progressed this season, following up a narrow defeat on return with wins in three of his next four starts; won a novice handicap hurdle with plenty in hand here 17 days ago so an 8lb rise is probably workable and shapes like he's well worth another go at this sort of trip; rider good value for the 5lb he can claim and leading claims.

💬 Comment: Bumper/maiden hurdle winner and form of latest run at Limerick working out well; good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Hexham bumper winner and retrospectively promoted to first (winner DQ'd for banned substance) in a Wexford maiden hurdle in October; form of her subsequent fifth in a Limerick maiden hurdle over Christmas has been boosted several times since and an opening mark of 110 could underestimate her.
