💬 Comment: Has yet to win a handicap but has threatened and 2m7f looked too far the last time
🔦 Spotlight: Has yet to win a handicap (dual hurdle winner) but she wasn't far away in 2m5f/2m4f races before Ascot's 2m7f perhaps stretched her last time; handicap mark hasn't really gone anywhere but she's a contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wasn't herself last time over fences; on a competitive mark for this return to hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: Only 2lb higher than for her sole success over hurdles gained at Ludlow last March (2m, soft); runner-up in her first two chases before a disappointing run at Hereford; had a break since then and, back over hurdles, she could have a say if she stays (best runs have been at up to 2m1f).
