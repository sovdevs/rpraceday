üí¨ Comment: Smart at best; lightly raced last year; absent 350 days but given good weights chance
üî¶ Spotlight: Developed into a smart 5f performer in 2022 and early 2023 (RPR 108); only seen three times in 2024, doing enough to think he retained some spark; absent for 350 days but he's been given a real chance by the handicapper and he could outrun his likely big odds.
