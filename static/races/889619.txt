💬 Comment: Eight-race maiden; runner-up the last twice but creeping up the weights and drawn widest
🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 but has finished second on three occasions, including twice at Kempton last month; creeping back up the weights though and he has the widest stall to negotiate this time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gifted easy lead when winning on 2nd start (7f, Tapeta); makes h'cap debut at fair level
🔦 Spotlight: Gifted the softest of leads when winning a four-runner novice at Newcastle (7f) on her second start; couldn't cope with a penalty back there last time; makes her handicap debut at a realistic level and well drawn so not ruled out.
