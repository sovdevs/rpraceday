🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two-time maiden hurdle runner-up who holds leading form claims
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a point and also two maiden hurdles (2m7f, good/good to soft); disputing the lead (albeit driven) when falling three out in Ludlow maiden (3m, good to soft) last time; the drop back in trip may not be an obvious positive but he holds leading form claims.
