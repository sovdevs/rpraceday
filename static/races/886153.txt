💬 Comment: Opened account over 2m last month and could easily have more to offer over this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Much more competitive since switched to handicaps for last two runs, more recently when scoring at Taunton (2m, soft) five weeks ago; could easily have more to offer if today's longer trip suits; high on the list.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way over 3m2f on Boxing Day and today's trip looks more suitable
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to hit peak form since returning from long absence in October but ran fair bit better than eventual 21l defeat suggests when fourth at Fontwell (3m2f, soft) on Boxing Day, and this drop back in trip looks the right move.

🔦 Spotlight: Won by wide margin on last season's hurdling debut (2m3f) but well beaten all four starts since (2m4f-3m1f); not written off just yet but it's probably wise to wait for some encouraging signals from the betting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lost her way last spring and was pulled up last month, after a layoff; revival needed
🔦 Spotlight: Lost her form after last season's heavy-ground novice win and there was no sign of a revival at Exeter last month, after a layoff; needs to have taken significant benefit from that recent outing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed mare; shade disappointing on handicap debut but had wind op soon afterwards
🔦 Spotlight: 🔍 unexposed mare who displayed improvement when keeping-on second in Sedgefield maiden (2m4f, soft) in December; below that form on subsequent handicap debut but had wind op soon afterwards and may still have potential.
