🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Listed wins in 2024, including this race; Friday's rain a plus; good draw; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Admirable filly who won twice in Listed company last season, including this race; handles any ground but Friday's rain certainly won't hurt; well drawn and she should make a bold bid for a yard going nicely.
Horse quote: 2024-06-15 at Sandown (5f): "The second is a good horse and I thought Adaay In Devon did well to give her 3lb. I thought we might get caught in the closing stages. She's very easy to train, a good-tempered filly, and she's still growing. We could have gone to the Commonwealth Cup Royal Ascot but she'd have to run a blinder just to finish fifth or sixth. I put her in the five-furlong handicap on Friday in case she was beaten but she won't go now she's got a penalty. We'll stick to the fillies' black-type races this year but distance wise could step up to seven furlongs. I expect she'll stay in England for now but she could go abroad next year. She's more than paid for herself - Rod Millman, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second to Adaay In Devon in this race last year; solid Group form after; still low mileage
🔦 Spotlight: Won both starts as a 3yo; chased home Adaay In Devon in this race 12 months ago (good ground) before winning a Listed race at Haydock one month later; solid efforts in Group company afterwards and she's one to consider with further progress a distinct possibility after just eight starts.
Horse quote: 2024-05-24 at Haydock (6f): "Electric Storm had some developmental issues as a yearling so really she didn't train as a two-year-old and only stepped up her training midsummer as a three-year-old. She's got the speed for five but she stays seven, I think six is probably her ideal trip. I think there will be further improvement there. We have three four-year-old fillies by Night Of Thunder - Cloud Cover won on All-Weather Finals day, Royal Dress won a Listed race at Goodwood a couple of weeks ago and now this filly has won a Listed race too - James Tate, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On losing run of 16 but she's capable at this level and finished 3rd in this race in 2024
🔦 Spotlight: Well suited by good ground or slower; often ran well last year, including when third in this race on her reappearance, but her losing run now stands at 16; cheekpieces return today.
Horse quote: 2023-05-06 at Newmarket (5f): "I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't delighted by the rain. Vadream just loves it. She's a very good filly but she has to have her conditions and she got them today. I'd say (the Duke of York Stakes) is unlikely and will come a bit soon, we'll just run her where the conditions are right - Charlie Fellowes, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't stay 7f in Group 3 when last seen; earlier 6f wins most promising; yard in top form
🔦 Spotlight: Looked a good prospect when winning 6f fillies' events on her first two starts (good to firm and good to soft); stretched by 7f in Group 3 company when last seen in October; faced with a different challenge on her return to action but the stable are banging in winners and she still has considerable potential.
Horse quote: 2024-09-06 at Haydock (6f): "First Instinct has been faultless. I was a bit worried that the ground today might just blunt her speed but she fell asleep early - which was key I think - and showed that trademark turn of foot which she showed on her first run. I think she'll be even more effective on better ground - Tom Marquand, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Group 3 winner in Dubai last year; regularly highly tried since and the return to Listed company didn't spark a revival at Doncaster three weeks ago (6f, good to soft); seems happiest on good or quicker so significant rainfall would be a negative.
Horse quote: 2024-03-02 at Meydan (5f): "I had the luck to have a good draw today, so I just played my card. It's the first time I've ridden Frost At Dawn. She's fast and I think she would travel even better over six furlongs - Mickael Barzalona, jockey."

💬 Comment: Promise in Ireland last year; new connections won this race with a similar type in 2022
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish filly; useful form for Patrick Foley in her first season of racing last year, including a Listed second at Naas last July (6f, yielding); improvement is a must but that was the case when White Lavender, one with a similar profile, won this race in 2022 on her first run for these connections; betting useful.
Horse quote: 2024-06-26 at Naas (6f): "Over The Blues did that pretty well. She was green at the Curragh and she was keen after that. She gets six well and might even be good over five. With a bit of luck all she will do is improve. We might come back here next month for a Listed race - Pat Foley, trainer"

Horse quote: 2024-05-20 at Carlisle (5f): "Englemere is very tough. She fluffed her lines a little bit at the start but we went very quick and for a filly to win with a penalty takes a bit of doing. She's a nice filly - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Followed Salisbury win last May with two 3rds in Listed company; 🔍 unexposed; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Came to hand early last season, winning at Salisbury last May (5f, soft) before a good third in Listed company at York's Dante meeting; absent for 168 days prior to another good third in Listed company at Newmarket (6f, good); still 🔍 unexposed.
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Salisbury (5f): "It was very pleasing. We fancied Running Queen the first day at Newbury but it was a competitive race and she raced on the wing a bit. She seems to have come forward and she did it nicely. She's always stuck her head above the parapet and has come to hand early. She's always looked like an above-average filly, so it's nice to do it and it's for a new owner in the yard too. She'll hopefully have some nice targets throughout the year. I'm sure she'll get six furlongs no problem, but she's quick and we're happy for now keeping her over five - Ollie Sangster, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Better than ever in 2024, winning four 5f handicaps (ground ranging from good to firm to heavy); should appreciate the likely strong pace and could pinch black type this year granted further progress; only midfield in the 2023 renewal on her only run at Bath; stable also runs Adaay In Devon.

🔦 Spotlight: In the form of her life prior to finishing fifth in this race last year (would have been placed with a clear run); ended 2024 quietly but was back on the up when second to an interesting handicapper over C&D on seasonal return 16 days ago (fourth won last week); drawn wide and can race freely if not getting cover but no surprise to see her outrun her likely odds once again.
