🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 8yo; won handicap chases last two starts, plenty in the tank over C&D latest
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 8yo; switched to handicaps and fences this season and has come good at Hexham (2m4f, soft) and Newcastle (C&D, good to soft) on last two outings; always prominent in both and, after mistakes at the first two fences, it looked as if he had plenty in the tank last time (Coqolino sixth); up another 7lb but good chance for the hat-trick.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won chase debut; slightly shorter trips than this were perhaps not ideal when placed since
🔦 Spotlight: Won two soft-ground handicap hurdles last season, one over 2m4f here; won at Doncaster (2m4f) in December on chasing debut and slightly shorter trips may not have been ideal in his two placed efforts since, all on good to soft; major player in this small field.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 8yo; won handicap chases last two starts, plenty in the tank over C&D latest
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 8yo; switched to handicaps and fences this season and has come good at Hexham (2m4f, soft) and Newcastle (C&D, good to soft) on last two outings; always prominent in both and, after mistakes at the first two fences, it looked as if he had plenty in the tank last time (Coqolino sixth); up another 7lb but good chance for the hat-trick.

🔦 Spotlight: Won two soft-ground handicap hurdles last season, one over 2m4f here; won at Doncaster (2m4f) in December on chasing debut and slightly shorter trips may not have been ideal in his two placed efforts since, all on good to soft; major player in this small field.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flopped on handicap hurdle debut and his jumping was not up to scratch on chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Irish maiden point winner (2023) who was second over about 2m4f last season in two of his three novice hurdles; flopped on handicap hurdle debut last April (3m1f, heavy) and his jumping was not up to scratch when favourite again on chase debut in November; back down in trip and early days.
