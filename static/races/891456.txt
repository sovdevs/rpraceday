🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Scored last month for the second time over hurdles and has to be in serious calculations
🔦 Spotlight: 1m4f winner off 1lb lower at Chester (good to soft) last May on first run for James Owen; he's had an uneven time of it since but scored last month for the second time over hurdles and firmer ground today should be okay; has to be in serious calculations.
Horse quote: 2024-05-25 at Chester (12.5f): "I was tasked with finding the owners a fun dual-purpose horse and I hope Cavern Club can keep going forward and win a few more races. He will definitely go hurdling at some point; he's already done lots of schooling. The Northumberland Plate could definitely be a target, but there's a few more runs to go before then - James Owen, trainer."

💬 Comment: 📈 progressive 2024 and creditable return but pedigree says he's not a certainty to get 1m4f
🔦 Spotlight: Progressed well in handicaps last term when he did not have soft ground and he reappeared with a creditable front-running second at Redcar (1m2f, good) 15 days ago; another bold show looks on its way but, although he stuck on well last time, pedigree says he's not a certainty to get 1m4f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Even if on best behaviour (virtually refused to race on return), 1m4f is a nagging worry
🔦 Spotlight: Landed a £100,000 bonus for winning three Sunday Series races (1m3f, 1m6f and 2m1f) last term; 3-6 once handicapping in that campaign and second favourite at Musselburgh nine days ago, despite the drop back to 1m4f, but he had no chance after virtually refusing to leave the stalls; even if on his best behaviour, 1m4f is a nagging worry.
Horse quote: 2024-08-18 at Pontefract (17f): "Letsbefrank is getting very lethargic in his races and he was never on the bridle. He's tough and game, but the Johnston horse got a soft lead and you know they'll always keep going. But this horse keeps digging, he's tough. I'm lucky I'm the one pointing him, but this has been the plan for Jim and his team since the winter. He's had all the races mapped out, credit to him. To win one race is hard but to win three takes some doing - Paul Mulrennan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His only run on turf (last of nine in a good-ground handicap) is the main worry
🔦 Spotlight: His two wins were in January 2024 and January 2025, the latter when awarded a 1m4f AW handicap after interference; below-form second favourite over that same C&D on latest outing when trying a Class 2, but he's back down in class for this; it's his only run on turf (last of nine in a good-ground handicap) which is the main worry.

🔦 Spotlight: Both wins on AW, including when well on top at Newcastle (1m2f) in September with first-time blinkers, which have been kept since; a novice second on good ground last May gives some hope for this return to turf and a respectable AW reappearance three weeks ago suggests he's worth this first crack at 1m4f; needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: 2021 Listed winner, form which is long gone but he continues down the weights and his never-nearer sixth of nine to an impressive winner over C&D ten days ago suggested that all hope is not lost.
Horse quote: 2021-08-14 at Newbury (7f): "Masekela has a couple of entries in the Champagne Stakes and the Royal Lodge and I need to talk to Andrew, but my view is that a mile is the right distance. William said he's a nice horse and there would be more to come. He said he'd make a nice 3yo, which we always felt as he's a big horse - Mick Mariscotti, owner."

💬 Comment: Has a form chance if he's on song for this reappearance, which he wasn't last year
🔦 Spotlight: His 2023 and 2024 campaigns contained just one win (1m6f here last June) but he was pretty consistent off higher marks last term and has a form chance if he's on song for this reappearance, which he wasn't last year.
Horse quote: 2022-08-27 at Beverley (10f): "We travelled really well around there, but didn't go as quickly as I thought they would do. It turned into a bit of a sprint, which we didn't really want, but I got Kitsune Power rolling 3f down. I'd say he'd easily get 1m4f in time. He was knocking on the door previously - Kevin Stott, jockey."
