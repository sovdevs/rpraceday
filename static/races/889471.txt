🔦 Spotlight: Low-key effort over 2m on second hurdle start but he'd previously prevented a useful one from having it all his own way over this trip at Leopardstown after Christmas and the return to 2m4f there (also on yielding) paid off handsomely last month; one of the better ones.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Left clear for Punchestown win; tough task at Cheltenham since; may be similar story again
🔦 Spotlight: Turned over on hurdle debut but he took a healthy step forward when left clear by his main rival's late fall at Punchestown (2m1f, soft) in January; found the Turners at Cheltenham too tough since and so might this.
