üí¨ Comment: Useful Sandown win on debut and respectable third in Grade 2 since; highly tried this time
üî¶ Spotlight: Moved to Alan King after Ayr bumper win and he found the most on hurdle debut at Sandown (2m, soft) against a rival who showed up well at the Cheltenham Festival next time; just a respectable effort in Grade 2 at Kelso (2m2f, good to soft) last month suggests he's highly tried here.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Wore down the favourite in the Triumph only to get nailed close home; redemption awaits
üî¶ Spotlight: Headed the Triumph Hurdle betting before making a good all-round impression on British debut at Ascot (1m7f, good); he again raced freely, without overdoing it, when always prominent at Cheltenham (2m1f, good to soft) but there was plenty in reserve when he finally wore down the favourite, only to get nailed close home by a smart one off the Flat; redemption awaits.
