🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive novice with likely more to offer on handicap debut; Townend's pick
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Grade 2 Aintree bumper scorer Seo Lin on Ballinrobe debut last May (good) and steady improvement in three maiden hurdle runs this winter, including plenty keen when second at Navan and most recently settled better in hood/tongue-tie combination to win at Naas in February on heavy; back from a break for handicap debut with likely more to offer (headgear left off) and Townend's pick.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grand Annual winner of obvious appeal here off 17lb lower hurdles mark
🔦 Spotlight: Two of five career wins have come at Cheltenham Festival; 2023 Fred Winter and in last month's Grand Annual Handicap Chase when battling on well winner here; back hurdling off 17lb lower mark and has to be greatly respected, although would prefer better ground.
Horse quote: 2025-03-12 at Cheltenham (16f): "Jazzy Matty has gone from strength to strength since we got him. He really enjoys the way we train, and it's unbelievable to have gone this today. It's been a long couple of weeks before today - we only had one horse coming over and a lot of time and effort has gone into him. Everyone at home in the yard - we've a great team and to get this is unbelievable. To win on the big stage means so much and hopefully showcases that we can get one ready for the big day as well - Cian Collins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Decent Cheltenham run; back in handicap company and at 2m, could well have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive mare was gaining her second success over hurdles when impressive winner of the valuable William Hill Hurdle at Newbury (2m, soft) in February; big ask nonetheless in 2m4f Grade 1 Close Brothers' Mares Hurdle at Cheltenham and not at all discredited when beaten 13.5l, after hitting the last; back in handicap company and at 2m, could well have more to offer.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Newbury (16.5f): "Joyeuse jumped and travelled well, and you'd have to say she was in the perfect position throughout. This is a great race and local too. That's only the fourth hurdle race of her life, so it's not easy. She can't run in a Cheltenham handicap because she's not had enough runs, so where we go now we'll think about on another day - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won going away at Leopardstown; 10lb rise but could go well off light weight
🔦 Spotlight: German Flat winner was 0-7 over hurdles for Tony Mullins before scoring on first start for Gavin Cromwell in 2m Leopardstown handicap last month in a first-time hood, short of room at the last but winning going away; up 10lb for that but won with plenty in hand and could go well here off light weight.
Horse quote: 2025-03-02 at Leopardstown (16f): "They went a great gallop which helped Serienmond settle. He's been very keen at home since he came to us, and we've been working hard on just trying to get him to do things right. He jumped well and did everything right. It wasn't a great race on paper so hopefully the handicapper is not too hard on him - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Down Royal second a solid effort; hard to be confident in but can't rule out
🔦 Spotlight: Group 1 winner in the Tattersalls Gold Cup in 2021; nowhere near as good a hurdler although decent second in quite valuable 2m1f Down Royal handicap in November; too keen in a first-time tongue-tie latest on flat; hard to be confident in but can't rule out.
Horse quote: 2024-02-11 at Navan (15.5f): "I said the other day that if Helvic Dream was in a Group race on the Flat, I'd fancy him, because he was that well in himself. He's still novicey for anything big, so I would have thought we'll try and get another run into him somewhere and then tip along. He will go back on the Flat again this year - Noel Meade, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-01-12 at Naas (19f): "American Money is what he is but he's a good solid horse. He'll probably go chasing at some stage. He's qualified for the final of this series at Punchestown, so that's where we'll target him - Eddie Harty, co-trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point and maiden winner, promise on h'cap debut latest, may need good ground, 5lb wrong
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point and Clonmel maiden hurdle winner, both on good ground; tough tasks in novice hurdles here (20.5f) and at Thurles (2m6f) but was still going okay when falling two out dropped back to 15.5f (good) at the latter venue on handicap debut in January; may need better ground than this and 5lb wrong, although he was runner-up here yesterday.
Horse quote: 2024-11-07 at Clonmel (16f): "The final hurdle was the winning of the race for Stuntman Steve and thankfully he came up for me. We have him six weeks and while he hadn't been away, we thought he was a nice horse so thought he'd go close - Keith Donoghue, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-01-29 at Punchestown (16f): "Anotherway stayed and galloped to the line but his jumping left a lot to be desired. Maybe it was the heavy ground as he jumped a lot better at Leopardstown. But he did what he was showing us at home today - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Veteran with a bit to find on recent form although never one to rule out; likes it soft
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran dual-purpose performer whose last win came in very valuable 2m handicap at last year's DRF on favoured soft ground off 120; recent runs leave him with a fair bit to find but never one to rule out.
Horse quote: 2024-02-04 at Leopardstown (16f): "I was a bit worried about the ground but Darragh (O'Keeffe) said it was no problem. I could never get Lord Erskine into a good race with a light weight and it was the same on the Flat. He'd a proper weight on his back today and there was a good gallop which suited him. His (late) owner Jerry Nolan was a pure gentleman. I rode winners for him and having an owner like him, you couldn't buy them - Harry Rogers, trainer."
