💬 Comment: Losing run is mounting up but his peak form sets a high standard
🔦 Spotlight: Below best this term and losing run is mounting up; not exactly one to take short odds about at present but his peak form, namely a success in the 2022 King George and second-place finish in the 2023 Cheltenham Gold Cup, sets a high standard in this field; tongue-tie replaces blinkers.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in this contest for the last two years and has filled the same position in two good handicaps this term, the latest at Ascot; appears to hold a solid chance but is by no means certain to go one better, being a frustrating and low-yield performer; losing spell goes back to 2022.

💬 Comment: Impressive in handicap here in November; interesting back at Newbury
🔦 Spotlight: Has a record of 4-7 over fences and may have more to offer; perhaps unsuited by the return to Cheltenham most recently and is better judged on his impressive handicap success here (2m4f, good to soft) the time before; interesting back at Newbury, assuming he stays the new trip.

💬 Comment: Useful over 2m4f and this step back up in distance is worth exploring
🔦 Spotlight: Similar type to Fugitif, having been a regular participant in notable 2m4f handicaps at Cheltenham (has won two of them); form dipped last time; held every chance when final-fence faller in good 3m handicap at Doncaster two years ago, so this step back up in distance is worth exploring.

🔦 Spotlight: Clear second in veterans' event at Market Rasen (3m) last month, showing that he retains a good deal of ability aged 13; however, beaten twice in this race (pulled up in 2023, fourth of five in 2024) and looks unlikely to make it third-time lucky.

🔦 Spotlight: Below best this term and losing run is mounting up; not exactly one to take short odds about at present but his peak form, namely a success in the 2022 King George and second-place finish in the 2023 Cheltenham Gold Cup, sets a high standard in this field; tongue-tie replaces blinkers.

💬 Comment: Largely 📈 progressive and could easily bounce back from Windsor defeat
🔦 Spotlight: Easily beat Protektorat in the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon (2m4f, soft; Grade 2); comprehensively unable to confirm placings with that rival at Windsor since, not beaten entirely by the 2m6f trip, but has proved largely 📈 progressive and could easily rebound; sibling has won at up to 3m2f.

💬 Comment: Impressive in handicap here in November; interesting back at Newbury
🔦 Spotlight: Has a record of 4-7 over fences and may have more to offer; perhaps unsuited by the return to Cheltenham most recently and is better judged on his impressive handicap success here (2m4f, good to soft) the time before; interesting back at Newbury, assuming he stays the new trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Similar type to Fugitif, having been a regular participant in notable 2m4f handicaps at Cheltenham (has won two of them); form dipped last time; held every chance when final-fence faller in good 3m handicap at Doncaster two years ago, so this step back up in distance is worth exploring.

💬 Comment: Runner-up in this race for the last two years; hasn't won since 2022
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in this contest for the last two years and has filled the same position in two good handicaps this term, the latest at Ascot; appears to hold a solid chance but is by no means certain to go one better, being a frustrating and low-yield performer; losing spell goes back to 2022.

💬 Comment: Impressive in handicap here in November; interesting back at Newbury
🔦 Spotlight: Has a record of 4-7 over fences and may have more to offer; perhaps unsuited by the return to Cheltenham most recently and is better judged on his impressive handicap success here (2m4f, good to soft) the time before; interesting back at Newbury, assuming he stays the new trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Clear second in veterans' event at Market Rasen (3m) last month, showing that he retains a good deal of ability aged 13; however, beaten twice in this race (pulled up in 2023, fourth of five in 2024) and looks unlikely to make it third-time lucky.
