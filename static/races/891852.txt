🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all for 7l success here ten days ago and obvious chance under a 4lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Often front-runner and ridden since October by Elle-May Croot; has gained his last five wins here, the latest ten days ago by 7l when dominant throughout; obvious chance under a 4lb penalty.
Horse quote: 2022-12-13 at Southwell (AW) (11f): "It was a furlong shorter today and Lednikov needed every stride, but Joey gave him a great ride. The horse is very genuine, he gives his best all the time, and he's versatile - Ivan Furtado, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Wolverhampton classified winner over 9.4f in January and was third of ten in a handicap there three weeks ago; starts have been an issue, though, and he was withdrawn last week after getting loose at the start; could feature should the new hood focus his mind.
Horse quote: 2025-01-04 at Wolverhampton (AW) (9.5f): "It's Desiderata's first run for us. We worked him up in Lambourn in the week and he went very well with a 60-rated horse so we expected him to run a nice race - Thomas Faulkner, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only sixth in a classified race before finishing tailed off on hurdling debut; opposable
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 1m4f classified race on Polytrack 14 months ago but only sixth of nine at that level here in January before finishing tailed off on his hurdling debut (after wind surgery); wouldn't be the obvious place to turn.
Horse quote: 2024-02-23 at Lingfield (AW) (12f): "We're very happy for owner-breeder Richard Marriott and his broodmare Battery Power. Velvet Vulcan is now the fourth winner from the mare from four runners - Michael Keady, joint-trainer."
