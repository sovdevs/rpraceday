💬 Comment: Cheltenham third has taken some knocks but he's clearly a major player at this lower level
🔦 Spotlight: Both bumper runs on good ground; strong in the finish to win at Sedgefield and again when third of six in a Listed race at Cheltenham; the latter form has taken some knocks but he's clearly a major player at this lower level, even with a penalty to carry this time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some questions asked over what he achieved at Lingfield but trainer is much respected
🔦 Spotlight: Trainer has always done well in bumpers and this 5yo ran okay to be third at Lingfield (AW) two months ago, though the close proximity of a modest horse in fourth holds that form down; still respected.

💬 Comment: £14,000 3yo; half-brother to prolific 2m chase winner Halcyon Days; check the market
🔦 Spotlight: £14,000 3yo; half-brother to prolific 2m chase winner Halcyon Days; dam well-beaten half-sister to 1m2f and 1m5f Flat/2m6f-3m3f useful hurdle/chase winner Inch Closer and useful 6f-1m winner Lead The Dance; stable only 1-18 in bumpers in recent seasons but it makes sense to check the market.

💬 Comment: Flat-bred; tailed off at Kempton a year ago but on soft ground and was only 100-30
🔦 Spotlight: Flat-bred gelding who cost £50,000 as a 2yo; made his debut in these colours but for Ben Pauling when appearing to perform below market expectations (100-30) on soft ground at Kempton a year ago; should be better than that and today's good ground can help.
