🔦 Spotlight: Bounced back from a poor run last month, making all to win readily by 13l at Doncaster (2m3f, good); 8lb higher today and may not be allowed the luxury of an uncontested lead this time but evidently in very good nick.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In the frame all four hurdling starts and could be hard to catch in this easier grade
🔦 Spotlight: Ended last season with creditable second in 18-runner Cheltenham bumper (good ground) and has made the frame on all four hurdling starts this term; went off too hard when well-held third in Kempton handicap (2m, good to soft) last month but could be hard to beat in this lower grade if subsequent wind op aids her finishing effort.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won twice off higher marks last March but has not been firing on all cylinders lately
🔦 Spotlight: Came good with two soft-ground wins at Southwell (2m4f) last March and is well handicapped on those exploits but hasn't been firing on all cylinders lately and others in this line-up have more pressing claims.
