🔦 Spotlight: Suited by the step up in trip when staying on for close second of 16 in first-time tongue-tie/cheekpieces (both retained) on handicap debut at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) in December; this brother to 3m4f winner Tim Pat is 🚀 open to further improvement now tackling 3m; could play leading role.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won on stable debut at Huntingdon 16 days ago and he's respected off 4lb higher today
🔦 Spotlight: Snapped a long losing sequence on this month's stable debut at Huntingdon (3m1f, good to soft), when wearing a first-time visor (retained) on his first outing since wind surgery; runs off 4lb higher today and could have more to offer for this yard; respected.

💬 Comment: Struggled in first two handicaps; transformation needed on first run since wind surgery
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who kicked off rules career with two fair performances in late 2023; however, his form has gone the wrong way since and he was tailed off/pulled up towards the end of last year in his first two handicaps; hopes are pinned on wind op/cheekpieces prompting a transformation.
