🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise in a point and a bumper, both on heavy; absent 393 days but looks a key player
🔦 Spotlight: The form of his second in an Irish point (October 2023; 3m, heavy) is solid enough and he also showed useful ability when second in a Chepstow bumper on his rules debut (2m, heavy); should make up into a useful performer over hurdles and he's starting out in a winnable race; absent 393 days so the betting should be useful.

💬 Comment: Not seen the best of him over hurdles yet; will stay further but is in with a chance
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a good-ground maiden point (2m4f) two years ago; similar modest level of form in three novice hurdles this winter, catching the eye of the stewards when keeping on for a never-dangerous third at Lingfield (2m, heavy) two weeks ago; Ben Jones replaces a 10lb claimer today; likely to come into his own when handicapping over further but has a chance today.
