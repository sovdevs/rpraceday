🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D scorer; good third at Sedgefield 30 days ago; one to consider with cheekpieces added
🔦 Spotlight: C&D scorer who turned in his best run of the season when third of six in 2m Sedgefield handicap 30 days ago; he's one to consider with cheekpieces added.
Horse quote: 2023-01-22 at Newcastle (AW) (10f): "They put this extra meeting on and Russian Virtue has been a bit unlucky for us on the Flat, being placed plenty of times. So while the weather is not great for going hurdling we thought we'd give him a spin on the Flat and it's great that he's won a third race in a row. I hope he'll be one for the two-mile hurdle at the Northern Lights finals at Musselburgh. He may run at Sedgefield on Sunday and get him qualified - Rebecca Menzies, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: A fair 1m6f Flat winner; lightly raced over hurdles and has her first run in this sphere since unseating her rider in 2m Bangor handicap (likely to have been placed) last May; needs considering.
Horse quote: 2019-06-15 at York (12f): "It's the right time of year for the three-year-olds taking on the older horses. Arctic Fox has won three in a row and the step up in trip has not bothered her - Richard Fahey, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-07-28 at Uttoxeter (16f): "Ambassador came to us in good form and all we've had to do is tick him over. He was given a good ride by Brian Hughes and it just sort of fell right for us really - Micky Hammond, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat only one over 2m3f here 11 days ago; he needs to get back on track
🔦 Spotlight: A three-time winner (at up to 2m5f) in the first half of the season but his more recent form is not so encouraging, beating only one over 2m3f here 11 days ago; he needs to get back on track.
Horse quote: 2022-03-25 at Musselburgh (17.5f): "The Navigator fell in this race last year and he never really recovered. I deliberately went to Sedgefield because I thought if there was anywhere he could get his confidence back it would be there, and he needed it. He's got a lot of ability, he's a big beautiful horse, he's stunning - Dianne Sayer, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last on chasing debut at Sedgefield in November; needs to bounce back after a break
🔦 Spotlight: Winless since his debut over hurdles in 2023 and he came in last of seven on his chasing debut at Sedgefield (2m3f) in November; he needs to bounce back after a break with cheekpieces refitted.
Horse quote: 2023-03-24 at Musselburgh (17.5f): "Quaresome was a bit green - Donald said he would be - and he was jumping a bit big early doors. But they went a good gallop and his jumping flattened out. He finished off well and he'll get further, but he's no need to go further just yet. He's still a bit babyish so I pulled him into the middle of the track to give him a clear sight at the last. I always felt I was going to win - Brian Hughes, jockey."
