🔦 Spotlight: Record of 0-7 but she did well to finish third at Wolverhampton (7f; tongue-tie added) last month, after a wide trip; 1lb lower here and has possibilities if she can build on that last run.

🔦 Spotlight: Was only eighth of 11 on handicap debut at Lingfield (1m, Polytrack) last month but she raised her game over that trip at Kempton yesterday when just winning on the nod; more needed if taking part under penalty.
