🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Turf debut; hung badly left when challenging for 1m4f win last time but he's progressing
🔦 Spotlight: Went close when favourite for a Newcastle handicap last month and went one better with cheekpieces added at Wolverhampton (again 1m4f on AW) three weeks later; makes turf debut over a trip that looks plausible; hung badly left when challenging last time and is now up 4lb but he's progressing.

💬 Comment: Taking fourth in his last two AW handicaps (1m4f/1m6f) this term wasn't that persuasive
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning debut at Newcastle last May; consistent rather than 📈 progressive and taking fourth in his last two handicaps (1m4f/1m6f) this term wasn't that persuasive; also a bit to prove on this second turf start.

💬 Comment: Might be open to improvement in this second campaign, but 1m6f may be shorter than ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Musselburgh (2m2f, good) last August in second-time cheekpieces, which was followed by two solid thirds (2m/1m7f); presumably needed the race when last of five on recent return and might be open to improvement in this second campaign, but 1m6f may be shorter than ideal.
