🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never dangerous on stable debut but is well handicapped and might come on for the run
🔦 Spotlight: Never dangerous on last month's stable debut and now 0-26 under all codes but is well handicapped on some of last year's form for Mark Usher and seems versatile regarding ground; wears first-time cheekpieces today; may yet come good for Fergal O'Brien.
