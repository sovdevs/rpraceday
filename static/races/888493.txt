🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came from well back to win a C&D handicap in good style ten days ago; this tougher up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: 6f win here in October and she relished the return to 7f when sweeping through from the rear to win a well-run C&D handicap ten days ago; that was against her own sex and she's in deeper today but respected despite a 5lb rise in the weights.

🔦 Spotlight: He was bidding for a quick course hat-trick when narrowly denied by Broken Spear over C&D ten days ago (pair clear); closely matched with that rival again and much will depend on how easy a lead he can establish.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tapeta hat-trick this winter; unlucky in running in a stronger race at Kempton latest
🔦 Spotlight: Reeled off a Tapeta hat-trick (7f twice and 1m) around the turn of the year; beaten off this mark twice since his latest win but he saw no daylight until it was too late at Kempton 17 days ago; this is a weaker race and he's more appealing than most.
