🔦 Spotlight: 10-race maiden but signs his turn may be near in a couple of starts this term; however, was turned over when favourite at Navan last month, failing to make all and needs to prove he's stays this far on heavy ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who didn't show much under rules last year but he returned from a short break with a narrow defeat at Limerick last month, possibly helped by the slower conditions; nudged up 1lb and shaped like the step back up in trip may help.
