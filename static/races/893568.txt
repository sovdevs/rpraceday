💬 Comment: Two 5f wins this year, digging deep at Catterick 12 days ago; more to prove at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Took an age to get off the mark but he has won twice over 5f this year, digging deep at Catterick 12 days ago; 2lb rise less of a concern than the return to 6f (first crack at it since March 2023).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Better on AW but handicapped accordingly and plugged on for third at Nottingham latest
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who is better on AW than turf; that is reflected in his mark though and he was third at Nottingham nine days ago on his return to the grass (5f, good); was going nowhere at halfway there but plugged on late and the return to 6f won't hurt; considered in a weak race.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "Brian The Snail is an old boy who knows the game. Sometimes he breaks out a bit slow - like he's done today - but he thrives being hung onto and it's paid off - Ryan Kavanagh, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Makes his handicap debut at a low level and bred to do better at some point; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Never dangerous in three runs last year but there was some promise in his latest run at Doncaster (6f, soft) nine months ago; bred to do better at some point and he's a potential 🚀 improver now handicapping at a low level; interesting, especially if backed.
