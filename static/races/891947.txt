🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Place chance on his Listowel fourth but last three runs have been below par, needs more
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to trouble the judge in ten starts on the Flat and over hurdles; 0-5 in this sphere and rated 103; standout effort a 9l fourth of 10 in a 3yo hurdle at Listowel (2m, good); would have a place chance on that but last three runs have been below par; needs more.
