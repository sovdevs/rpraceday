💬 Comment: Back to form with close second at Newcastle (middle leg of a hat-trick for the winner)
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from a long absence for a 🆕 new yard this season and, having dropped down the weights, he returned to form with a close second of five at Newcastle (2m7f, good) this month; that was the middle leg of a hat-trick for the winner and this fellow could be thereabouts once more.

💬 Comment: Running well over 2m3f/2m4f since returning from an absence; stamina in his pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who is lightly raced for his age; returned from absence with fair fourth at Sedgefield (2m3f, good to soft) in December and he was in front when falling two out at Ayr (2m4f, soft) three weeks ago; there's stamina in his pedigree and he's a contender if seeing out this new trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below par the last twice but a case can be made on her promising form last autumn
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't been at her best the last twice and made mistakes last time, while she's also untested at this trip; however, this lightly raced 3m point runner-up stayed on well when placed in the autumn on her first two chase starts (2m4f, good) and is not written off.

🔦 Spotlight: Two wins at Huntingdon early last year and he's well treated on that form; fair fifth at Doncaster on penultimate start and heavy ground may have been too much at Leicester last time, but it's been an underwhelming campaign overall and others arrive with more pressing claims.
