🔦 Spotlight: Handy sort who has winning form over C&D and whose recent form ties in with a couple of these; still 4lb higher than when winning at Wolverhampton (7f, Tapeta) in December, but is off the same mark as when a close second behind Windsor Pass here last time; no reason why he shouldn't go well.
