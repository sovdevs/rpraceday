💬 Comment: Below best this season but good case can be made on her peak efforts last term
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner for whom a good case can be made on last season's peak efforts; hasn't hit the same heights on her four runs this term but Kempton last time was a step back in the right direction and she could take another today in first-time cheekpieces; chance.

💬 Comment: Unsuited by fences this season and could bounce back with big run now reverting to hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Below her best this season but has been running over fences and chasing doesn't appear to suit; won two Grade 2 mares' novice hurdles in early 2023 (2m4f/2m1f, good to soft/soft) and second in a mares' Grade 2 last January (3m, good); could bounce back with big run now reverting to hurdles.

💬 Comment: Others have more substance to their form but she retains potential now back down in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Others have a lot more substance to their form but she impressed when winning three mares' novice hurdles in the autumn (2m3f-2m5f, good/good to soft; also effective on soft) and failed to settle when fading over 3m last time; retains potential now back down in trip and none of the form horses arrive with rock-solid credentials; interesting contender.

💬 Comment: Talented handicapper but there's a strong suspicion she'll be out of her depth today
🔦 Spotlight: Landed a five-timer last season (1m7f-2m4f, good to soft-heavy) and 2024 concluded with two creditable seconds (hurdles then chase debut); had an excuse when tailed off over hurdles last time (mistake three out); however, there's a strong suspicion she'll be out of her depth today.

💬 Comment: Running well in defeat in mares' handicaps but she's up against it today
🔦 Spotlight: Ran really well in defeat in three mares' handicaps towards the end of last year (2m4f-3m, good/good to soft), making the frame; however, it's a long time since she won and she's up against it today.

🔦 Spotlight: Landed a five-timer last season (1m7f-2m4f, good to soft-heavy) and 2024 concluded with two creditable seconds (hurdles then chase debut); had an excuse when tailed off over hurdles last time (mistake three out); however, there's a strong suspicion she'll be out of her depth today.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in the 2023 Triumph Hurdle (2m1f, soft) and again finished second to Lossiemouth in the Grade 1 Mares Champion Hurdle at Punchestown last May (2m4f, soft; albeit comfortably beaten); absent since but key player if anywhere near the top of her game on this return to action.

💬 Comment: Unsuited by fences this season and could bounce back with big run now reverting to hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Below her best this season but has been running over fences and chasing doesn't appear to suit; won two Grade 2 mares' novice hurdles in early 2023 (2m4f/2m1f, good to soft/soft) and second in a mares' Grade 2 last January (3m, good); could bounce back with big run now reverting to hurdles.
