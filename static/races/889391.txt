üî¶ Spotlight: Won two handicap hurdles in the autumn (2m3f/2m4f, good to soft/good) and returned to form with close third of six on this month's chase debut at Fontwell (2m3f, soft); there's room for improvement in his jumping and the step back up in trip could work in his favour; üîç unexposed and respected.
