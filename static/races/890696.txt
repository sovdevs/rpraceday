🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Newmarket maiden winner on debut; seventh in Group 1 three weeks later; golden opportunity
🔦 Spotlight: Overcame inexperience to make a winning debut in a 1m maiden at Newmarket last October; pitched into the Group 1 Futurity at Doncaster three weeks later and came up short but he's clearly highly regarded and he's still entered in the 2000 Guineas and Derby; AW unlikely to hold any terrors and it will take a smart newcomer to lower his colours.
Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Newmarket (8f): "John and Thady Gosden expected Nebras to finish second or third, so he's surprised us a bit. Whether he runs again this year we don't yet know - Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to the owner."
