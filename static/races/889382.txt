🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wins on soft and heavy ground this winter; strong claims if handling today's surface
🔦 Spotlight: Won when upped to 2m4f at Uttoxeter (soft) in December on third handicap start and bounced back from Market Rasen fifth (2m4f, good to soft) to win at Bangor (2m7f, heavy) last time; this 🔍 unexposed 6yo has strong claims if today's forecast better ground isn't an issue.
