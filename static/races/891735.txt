🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dodgy form when beating 1-5f at Taunton but brings momentum into handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: Beat a good horse in his bumper and he's 2-4 over hurdles, though the long odds-on favourite rather fluffed his lines when edging that one out last time at Taunton; that might be dodgy form but he brings momentum into handicaps.

💬 Comment: Cut out quickly last time but posted much better form in winning her maiden in January
🔦 Spotlight: Cut out quickly when favourite for a 2m3f handicap at Warwick ten days ago; posted much better form in winning her maiden in January and not badly handicapped on that.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Newcastle (17f): "Queens Wish was good. I'm not sure the form of the race was super hot but it was good and she was good. She jumped nicely. We'll find another little novice event and see where we get to in the spring. It was nice to have a good start - Dan Skelton, trainer."

💬 Comment: Fairly exposed now and can't afford to be off his game with current mark
🔦 Spotlight: Good winner at Warwick before struggling in a Class 3 at Newbury; fairly exposed now and can't afford to be off his game with current mark.
Horse quote: 2023-01-07 at Wincanton (15f): "I wasn't sure after Celtic Art's his first run but he's definitely been getting better at home. He coped with this soft ground which is nice, he never runs well on quick ground so maybe this is the answer. He was very green at the backend of the race, so we'll need to get that sorted if he's going to progress. He's a lovely horse - Jeremy Scott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful novice, winning three on the bounce before finishing fourth in a Grade 2; however, a mammoth absence has seemingly stalled his progress judged by two heavy defeats this winter, both handicaps.
Horse quote: 2021-02-07 at Musselburgh (15.5f): "Bareback Jack is a horse we've always liked and that ground is sticky enough for him. As Mr Leslie says we have to get the runs into him. He's a lovely horse. He's not a natural front-runner and he wasn't slick over the last but he's got a fair engine. I'll leave future targets to Donald - Brian Hughes, rider."
