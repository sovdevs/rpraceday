🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won h'cap debut off 4lb higher, solid effort at Exeter latest, back up in trip, chance
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark by 6.5l on his handicap debut at Ayr in January (20.5f, soft) off 118 and is just 4lb higher now; solid effort in a class 2 novice at Exeter (18.5f, good to soft) on latest; steps back up in trip and carries top weight but should be thereabouts.

💬 Comment: Promise in maidens for former yard, pulled up on stable and handicap debut, watch
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 in maiden hurdles for Gavin Cromwell on a variety of ground but has shown ability; pulled up on his debut for this stable after a 270-day absence in his first handicap at Fairyhouse last month; tongue tie worn that day is discarded; probably best watched for now.
