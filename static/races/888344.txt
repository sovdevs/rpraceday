🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disqualified from first over C&D three months ago; can clearly win a race of this nature
🔦 Spotlight: Was failing to live up to his initial promise but then finished first in a C&D novice (soft) only to be disqualified for his jockey using the whip above the permitted limit; clearly capable of winning a race of this nature; copes fine with this drier surface.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper form makes for good reading and he won easily on his hurdling debut
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner whose only defeat under rules came at the hands of the smart Wingmen in a Punchestown bumper last spring and he gave that horse a race; back from a break to win pretty easily on his hurdling debut at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) and he's a good prospect.
