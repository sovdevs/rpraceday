🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 0.5l in Leopardstown maiden last August, a race that worked out; led all the way when landing 1m fillies' maiden at Dundalk in November; fair effort when fourth on handicap debut at that venue over 7f in December; could be well handicapped on turf.

Horse quote: 2022-05-20 at Curragh (7f): "Verhoyen is competitive off this sort of mark and he wears his heart on his sleeve. We put the blinkers back on him today, the conditions suited him and I told Billy to ride him like it was a 6f race - Michael Grassick, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seems to have lost his way since finishing runner-up in a claimer in May of last year
🔦 Spotlight: Seems to have lost his way since finishing runner-up in a claimer in May of last year; three tame efforts on AW for the yard this year; hard to fancy to present.
Horse quote: 2023-11-08 at Dundalk (AW) (7f): "El Bello was tough all the way to the line. Two horses came alongside him and he battled well. You'd like to think he could get an extra furlong - Dan King, jockey."
