🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rated 95, solid form in good ground maidens, won at Dundalk latest (7f), rain a worry
🔦 Spotlight: Rated 95; rock solid form in strong maidens last season all on good ground; confirmed that promise when off the mark on seasonal reappearance at Dundalk (7f); 1m should be within reach but not certain to handle soft ground on breeding; needs the rain to miss.
Horse quote: 2025-03-21 at Dundalk (AW) (7f): "Currawood is a nice horse. I thought the race conditions suited him and the track suited him, he has a good action. He was a little bit immature as a two-year-old, he was up behind and a bit down in front so I just took my time with him. He's levelled out over the winter and he's become the horse that his frame said he would, he's got a bit of length and scope. He'll go to Cork in a winners' race around a mile in April - Paddy Twomey, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rated 94, won on soft to heavy at Naas latest, should stay 1m, leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Rated 94; off the mark on seasonal reappearance at Naas (7f, soft to heavy) four weeks ago; form of maiden runs last year behind Cercene and Arizona Blaze has been boosted; should stay 1m; leading claims.
Horse quote: 2025-03-23 at Naas (7f): "We fancied Rowdy Yeats when he went to the Curragh last year but he was beaten by a very good horse [Arizona Blaze] and they were a long way clear of the third. I found it hard to get him back and I don't think he was 100 per cent when he came here at the end of the season. He has been training well. There's no reason why he can't win good races and I'd be hopeful he can be a stakes horse. Jamie said he might get further. He said he travelled really smoothly but parked a bit in front. Colin Keane rides him in all his work and always liked him a lot - Noel Meade, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard and preferred by McMonagle; rated 94; 1-7 on turf, the win coming over 7.5f in a Roscommon maiden (good); didn't seem to enjoy the testing ground at Naas on his return so the forecast rain is a concern; cheekpieces now added to tongue tie.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f maiden winner, not disgraced in stakes races last twice, may need the rain to miss
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 7f Leopardstown maiden on good ground last July; subsequently not disgraced in a Deauville Group 2 (soft) and a Listed race at Dundalk; rated 93 so well-treated by race conditions and 1m should be fine but she might want better ground.
Horse quote: 2024-07-18 at Leopardstown (7f): "Va Va Vroom ran really well at Gowran ajnd it was good to see her put it all together there. She was still a bit green but she did it well. She's in the Debutante and we will have a look at that - Jessica Harrington, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
