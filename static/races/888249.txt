üî¶ Spotlight: Won his first two handicaps (2m3f, good to soft/3m, soft) and his latest third in a strong race at Haydock was no backward step as he kept on takingly after suffering some interference; firmly on the upgrade and has a chance.

üî¶ Spotlight: Won a French bumper and impressed in adding a maiden hurdle and beginners chase in the McManus colours for Willie Mullins (both at 2m4f on slow ground); however, back from 407 days away, he was tailed off behind Protektorat in a valuable 2m6f chase at Windsor and then barely went a yard in a 2m Chepstow handicap (first-time tongue-tie); returns to hurdles with masses to prove.
