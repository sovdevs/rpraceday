🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Up the weights but very 📈 progressive and will run well if coping with the drying ground
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 8yo who probably needed his comeback run after a long absence and won his next two, over 2m4f at Aintree (soft) and nearly 3m at Sandown (heavy; made all for an 8l verdict); raised 9lb for last time but clearly 📈 progressive and will go well if coping with the drying ground.

💬 Comment: Improving Irish raider who will appreciate returning to this longer trip; much respected
🔦 Spotlight: Outclassed behind Cheltenham runner-up The Yellow Clay in a Grade 3 before making successful handicap debut upped to 3m1f at Navan (yielding to soft); nothing wrong with his second back there over 2m4f when understandably keeping on; looks on an upward trajectory and he's his shrewd Irish trainer's only runner on the card.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy Newbury winner and could be 📈 progressive enough to handle the 10lb rise; should stay
🔦 Spotlight: Has only had the nine races and won his last two, last time at Newbury barely coming off the bridle to win very cosily by a length; steps up from 2m4f but there's plenty of stamina in his pedigree; could be 📈 progressive enough to handle the 10lb rise; improvement has come on soft ground but he copes with it drier.

💬 Comment: Only his second attempt over this far under rules when staying on well to win at Doncaster
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point at 3m; unseated at Haydock in November on his first try over 3m as a hurdler but won on the second attempt at Doncaster two weeks ago (good to soft) where he stayed on well; just 3lb higher here and there's probably a lot more to come from this 6yo; beaten only 4l by Red Dirt Road over 2m4f at Aintree on Boxing Day and has a pull at the weights with the winner; good chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid efforts in Listed handicaps in Ireland the last twice; cheekpieces added; likes soft
🔦 Spotlight: A suspicion that he needs softer ground but, with a tongue-tie applied, he's run really well in good Listed handicaps in Ireland the last twice (at about 3m on soft); if he can deal with conditions and take to the new cheekpieces he won't be far away.

💬 Comment: An 🚀 improver this season at about 3m and cheekpieces go on after a lesser display at Exeter
🔦 Spotlight: Would probably have won at Chepstow over Christmas had he not hung badly right on the run-in, and he made amends with a rallying display to score at Wincanton (3m, good to soft); not badly handicapped off just a 3lb higher mark than for that win and cheekpieces go on after a lesser effort at Exeter.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a French bumper and impressed in adding a maiden hurdle and beginners chase in the McManus colours for Willie Mullins (both at 2m4f on slow ground); however, back from 407 days away, he was tailed off behind Protektorat in a valuable 2m6f chase at Windsor and then barely went a yard in a 2m Chepstow handicap (first-time tongue-tie); returns to hurdles with masses to prove.
