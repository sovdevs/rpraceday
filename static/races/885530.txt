💬 Comment: Won over 1m2f under Simon Walker at Newcastle last Sat but same rider on Yeoman now
🔦 Spotlight: Enhanced his good record at Newcastle this winter when getting on top towards the finish over 1m2f under Simon Walker last Saturday; the shorter trip might be more of an issue than the 2lb rise; Walker on Yeoman this time.

💬 Comment: Too keen when fourth over C&D latest; new headgear; remains 2lb above his winning mark
🔦 Spotlight: Raced keenly in front and nothing left in the closing stages when fourth over C&D a fortnight ago; first-time blinkers now replace the cheekpieces he's worn lately; remains 2lb above the mark he defied on Polytrack in the autumn.

💬 Comment: Back on a good mark but recent AW efforts no more than respectable
🔦 Spotlight: Has winning form on Tapeta and now 3lb lower than when dead-heating over 7f on turf last summer, but he hasn't obviously been shaping as if likely to take advantage, albeit caught a bit further back than ideal when fifth over C&D three weeks ago.
