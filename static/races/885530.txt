💬 Comment: Won over 1m2f under Simon Walker at Newcastle last Sat but same rider on Yeoman now
🔦 Spotlight: Enhanced his good record at Newcastle this winter when getting on top towards the finish over 1m2f under Simon Walker last Saturday; the shorter trip might be more of an issue than the 2lb rise; Walker on Yeoman this time.
