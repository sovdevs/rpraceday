🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won easily on heavy ground at Fontwell on latest chase start and can play a leading role
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily at Fontwell (2m5f, heavy) last month when back over fences for his second stable start; didn't jump well when fading into fourth of six over hurdles at Fakenham (2m7f, good) a fortnight ago but can play a leading role now back chasing and back down in trip.

💬 Comment: Well treated on last season's chase form but not threatening over hurdles this season
🔦 Spotlight: He's lower in the weights than when runner-up three times in a row over fences at Chepstow (2m3f, heavy) early last year; today's return to chasing could be a plus but he hasn't threatened over hurdles this season and needs to raise his game.
