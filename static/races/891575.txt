🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4-4 since joining Ruth Carr; unpenalised for last week's easy turf win; obvious claims
🔦 Spotlight: Flourished since joining Ruth Carr, winning handicaps at Newcastle (twice) and Southwell before completing his four-timer in fine style at Thirsk last week; made all on that occasion but he doesn't have to lead; unpenalised here and holds strong claims of making it 5-5 for William Pyle.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran out the easy winner of a 6f novice at Kempton on her debut last September; disappointed at Lingfield on her reappearance, second of four having been weak in the market (hung right); moves into handicaps with potential and this track lends itself to her racing style; one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready Thirsk win on his return (6f, good; visored first time); 🔥 big player despite 6lb rise
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to action with a cosy success at Thirsk 18 days ago (visored for the first time), travelling strongly and picking up well despite a tendency to wander around a bit in the closing stages; up 6lb but he's well drawn and makes more appeal than many.
Horse quote: 2024-08-27 at Ripon (6f): "Wreck It Ryley has done it well. I was just waiting for the gap to appear. He's run in blinkers a few times before and they do help him because he's a bit behind the bridle normally. He keeps breaking half a stride too slowly, but he's soon there on the heels of the leaders and he was there when I needed him. I had plenty of horse underneath me to commit and go - Dale Swift, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handy mark on last year's best; sharper for recent return but others still more appealing
🔦 Spotlight: Favourable mark on the pick of last season's best and his recent return to action at Ripon should have sharpened him up; can get going too late though and others are preferred today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Conditions shouldn't be an issue but he does need to rebound from a low-key run at Ripon
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't need to improve to win a 6f Redcar novice last September; didn't run badly on his first start for this yard at Wolverhampton last month but he was well beaten at Ripon 13 days ago when reportedly unsuited by the undulations of the track; well drawn for one that can race prominently and he's edging down the weights.

💬 Comment: Down in the weights but he's drawn widest and is an infrequent winner; look elsewhere
🔦 Spotlight: Infrequent winner; often flattered to deceive last year and he has been well beaten at 33-1 in two 7f handicaps this time around; drawn widest back at 6f and opposable despite a potentially lenient mark.
Horse quote: 2023-06-16 at York (7f): "They probably went a gallop and then stopped as Another Investment stayed on. He's always had an engine and he's been a bit unlucky - Nigel Tinkler, trainer."
