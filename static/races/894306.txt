🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner  before Cheltenham third, major chance if none the worse for Aintree run
🔦 Spotlight: Second in the 2023 Grand National; has failed to match that form in two subsequent attempts; however, has strong prospects based on his 18l victory over 3m1f at this venue in February, and a fine third at Cheltenham when nearly taking the wrong course early on did not help; finished well for third behind stablemate Stumptown; tailed off in Grand National.
Horse quote: 2025-02-03 at Punchestown (25f): "Vanillier has really sharpened up of late. The blinkers helped. He really enjoyed that. He's entered in the National and he has the option of the Cross Country at Cheltenham - Gavin Cromwell, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Beaten a neck by Vital Island in this race two years ago; won three handicaps in a fine spell in the following months; out of form last year until 33-1 third behind Stumptown here in December; well beaten in third behind Vanillier here in February; kept ticking over with a hurdles run; could be a factor over this trip.
Horse quote: 2023-02-19 at Punchestown (25f): "Stealthy Tom ran a lovely race here last year and got a lovely patient ride from Simon. He's only eight and will be a nice horse for this game in the future - Enda Bolger, trainer."

💬 Comment: Ran a fine race to take third place in the Topham, big chance on his Cheltenham fourth
🔦 Spotlight: 2023 Leopardstown Chase winner; no success since then; remote fifth behind Vanillier here in February; came from off the pace when fourth behind Stumptown at Cheltenham, only 1 1/4l behind Vanillier; has boosted his claims since by running a fine race to take third place in the Topham.
Horse quote: 2023-03-14 at Cheltenham (25f): "The Goffer keeps on galloping as he showed there and with that in mind the obvious place to go with him will be the Irish National at Fairyhouse over the Easter holiday as long as he comes out of this race in good heart - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-09-21 at Listowel (24f): "Busselton is as hard as nails. He jumps, stays, seems to go on any ground and he would have kept battling. It looked like a great performance. He has been on the go for over a year but he's a very honest horse - Brendan Powell, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No further success since winning  2023 Kerry National, limited appeal despite high rating
🔦 Spotlight: No further success since winning 2023 Kerry National; pulled up in his repeat bid last September; best run this season when third off his lower hurdles mark at Punchestown in November; limited appeal despite high rating.
Horse quote: 2023-09-20 at Listowel (24f): "Ricky gave him a fantastic ride. He was always in a good position, knowing that Desertmore House would not quicken for you in a hurry but stays very well. His jumping is very sound for a novice and it couldn't have gone any better. He's a lovely horse. He was bought originally by John Reddington for him to ride in bumpers, and John had a couple of great spins on him. But I always felt he would be at his best when he started going further and jumping fences. The Grand National might well end up being the long-term aim for him, we would have to start thinking about those sorts of races. I ran him in this for the experience, hoping he'd run well. He's passed a couple of tests out there today - Martin Brassil, trainer."
