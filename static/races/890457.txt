💬 Comment: On a hat-trick and the step up in trip will suit; likely hard to beat under a 7lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winning pointer at 3m last May (under Edward Vaughan) who's now on a hat-trick under rules, despite mistakes; rose to the occasion to give Alan Johns a send-off winner at Ffos Las (2m3.5f, good to soft) on Sunday; this tight track might not suit ideally but the step up in trip surely will and he's likely hard to beat under a 7lb penalty.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good run here in November and yard had a big winner on Saturday; chance
🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over fences but his second here (about 3m3f, good to soft) in November was up with his best and he also secured his only hurdle success at this track; may have just needed the run when fourth at Chepstow (2m7.5f, good) last month after an 80-day break; yard had a big winner at Aintree on Saturday and he should go well if this doesn't turn into too much of a speed test.

💬 Comment: Won at Newton Abbot in September; same mark, having been beaten 20l on last two starts
🔦 Spotlight: Sole success under rules came at Newton Abbot (2m5f, soft) in September but she was beaten about 20l on last two starts, last time weakening quickly over C&D in January; now back down to her winning mark, with Charlie Deutsch taking over, but comes with risks attached.
