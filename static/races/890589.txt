🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful Flat racer; promising third over hurdles last month; can improve again in handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: Useful on the Flat for Roger Varian; spoiled chance by racing far too freely on stable/hurdle debut in February but, with a hood fitted, settled much better and shaped with significant promise when third at Market Rasen (2m, good to soft) last month; the hood is left off here but, nevertheless, he's open to considerable further improvement on this handicap hurdle debut.
Horse quote: 2024-06-13 at Nottingham (8.5f): "Indemnity has had plenty of seconds so it's nice to get his head in front and hopefully he'll get some confidence off the back of this. I was kicking myself at Leicester because he travelled into it really well and I think I pressed the button a bit soon. He won his race, pricked his ears a bit and one just picked me off from out the back. I held on to him longer today. I think he'll be suited to a competitive handicap where they go fast and he can pick them up late - James Doyle, jockey."

💬 Comment: 2-4 over hurdles for current stable (one win over C&D); commands respect in current mood
🔦 Spotlight: Scored in first-time visor at Plumpton (2m, good) a fortnight ago and is now 2-4 over hurdles for current stable (other win was over C&D); now only 1lb below career-high mark but commands respect in current mood.
Horse quote: 2020-10-13 at Leicester (8f): "Tara Iti is bred to go on this testing ground. He travelled well despite being a little keen early. I took it up early enough, but he kept it up all the way to the line - Andrea Atzeni, jockey."

💬 Comment: Raced too freely when upped to 2m5f last month; player on earlier form at around 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Fair Flat racer who is still 🔍 unexposed over hurdles and returned from long layoff with two good handicap runs this winter (2m/1m7f, good to soft); well beaten after racing too freely over 2m5f last month, but today's drop back in trip looks the right move and the forecast good ground will suit.
Horse quote: 2023-06-15 at Yarmouth (11.5f): "This trip will be the bare minimum for Book Of Tales but the blinkers certainly focussed his mind and he's going the right way now - Charlie Johnston, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran no race last month but was in good form beforehand and remains well handicapped
🔦 Spotlight: Ran no race at Fakenham last month and needs to bounce back, but was placed twice on soft ground at Warwick in February and is now 5lb lower than when going close on good ground over C&D in November.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual hurdle winner on slow ground (once over C&D); needs to better last two efforts
🔦 Spotlight: Won soft-ground C&D maiden last season and double her tally in Stratford handicap (2m, heavy) on reappearance outing in October; however, her next two runs were underwhelming and she may not be ideally suited by the forecast good ground here.

💬 Comment: Pulled up on stable debut in December and arrives here with a lot to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Won 16-runner Bellewstown handicap (2m4f, good) for Gordon Elliott last summer, but left that stable after some below-par efforts in the autumn and was pulled up (albeit on soft ground) for 🆕 new yard in December; subsequent wind op might have helped but he arrives here with a lot to prove.
