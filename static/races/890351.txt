🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Collared late on at Lingfield in Jan and respected on the back of a positive run
🔦 Spotlight: Has yet to win on the Flat or over jumps and had the run of the race up front when collared at Lingfield last time (1m4f; January); still needs respecting on the back of a positive run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Six-time course winner but had his disappointments here last year
🔦 Spotlight: Six-time course winner but had his disappointments here last year and has finished last in his final two races on the AW.
Horse quote: 2021-05-18 at Brighton (7f): "We used to front-run with Rivas Rob Roy but since we've started holding him up he's relaxed and matured into a lovely horse. They always go hard here so we dropped him back, he likes it here, and he got a nice clear run. The further they went the better he got and he's very versatile now, anything from seven furlongs to a mile and a quarter  - John Gallagher, trainer."
