💬 Comment: Dam won at 1m1f-1m4f; yard gets bumper winners but 0-26 in them here
🔦 Spotlight: By Telescope out of winner at 1m1f-1m4f whose sibling Bobs Pride won a Group 3 over 1m2f before adding hurdle and chase successes; yard has the odd bumper winner but 0-26 in them here; perhaps one for later on.
