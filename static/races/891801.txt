💬 Comment: Yet to win on Polytrack but he comes here in good form and has run well over C&D before
🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner on Tapeta and he comes here in form, unlucky not to go even closer at Pontefract nine days ago (1m) when seeing no daylight in the closing stages; ran well over C&D back in February 2020; will need luck in running from the inside stall.
Horse quote: 2022-06-19 at Pontefract (10f): "We always knew Visibility had a lot of ability, he can be a bit hard to catch right but everything worked out well today. I never doubted he'd be as effective on turf - Scott Dixon, trainer"

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed over 1m+ and Simon Walker booked; usually blows the start though and not solid
🔦 Spotlight: Jumped poorly when pulled up on his hurdle debut at Fontwell on Boxing Day; prior to that he had run well over 1m3f at Kempton, despite his trademark slow start, and he is 🔍 unexposed over further than 1m; Simon Walker booked but he's not a solid betting proposition.

🔦 Spotlight: No closer than 5l in four runs for Joseph O'Brien, including one handicap, and she was a well-beaten 14-1 shot on her stable debut at Doncaster last month (1m, good); dropped 3lb and this is less competitive; could have a bigger effort in her.
