💬 Comment: Banging at the door on AW & placed over C&D on debut; latest 2nd looked one that got away
🔦 Spotlight: Still seeking her first win but she's been banging at the door on AW since October; looked to be launching a winning move at Lingfield three weeks ago but the winner pulled out more; should be just as good on turf and ran well over C&D on her debut; each-way shout.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Quiet in two AW runs this winter but return to turf/new tongue-tie could help; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Promising 2yo, winning on debut (5f, good) and placed in novice company either side of a Listed fourth subsequently; two modest AW runs this winter but dropped 5lb for his troubles and he could prove a different proposition back on turf with a tongue-tie fitted; Silvestre De Sousa back on for the first time since that debut success.
