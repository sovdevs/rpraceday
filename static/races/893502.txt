💬 Comment: 📈 progressive when last seen on the Flat; 2nd in Grade 3 hurdle at Cheltenham; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark in a 1m6f Navan handicap last year and second over this trip next time; turned into a useful hurdler over the winter and was runner-up in the Fred Winter Hurdle at Cheltenham; race-fit and can run well.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "Robbies Rock ran really well. He was flat out everywhere and had to take the brave man's route, but he stayed on really well and got to the line - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-10-13 at Cork (17.5f): "Turning in, I wasn't sure how much Alex (Harvey, on Dollar Value) had left but he stayed going. I didn't think it was over coming to the last. The Banger Doyle doesn't find a whole lot off the bridle as he stays going the same speed so I was trying to keep him on it as long as I could. He seems to be a bridesmaid a lot of the time so he deserved that - Michael O'Sullivan, rider, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Below form on Flat and over hurdles (made a noise) last two starts and has to bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time Flat winner up to this trip has also won over hurdles; below form on Flat and over hurdles (made a noise) last two starts and has to bounce back.
Horse quote: 2021-09-22 at Listowel (16f): "We always liked The Names Jock but he's got a bit high in the handicap on the Flat and we have this to turn to now and I hope he'll turn into a nice novice. He seems to have a little bit of class. He might not be a winter horse but he's a nice horse for this kind of ground. I was anxious to see if he would jump as good on the track as he would at home. It took him into the race as there was a fair good gallop - John Kiely, trainer."

💬 Comment: Started slowly and well beaten on Flat return and needs loads more up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Dual AW winner over a mile has run well in defeat at times over hurdles too; started slowly and well beaten on Flat return and needs oads more up in trip.
Horse quote: 2020-12-16 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Catena Zapata improved a lot from the first day and the step up to a mile suited him. I didn't want to make it but I didn't want them to go too slow. He really stuck his neck out. He's a lovely big horse and should get 1m2f next season - Billy Lee, rider"

Horse quote: 2021-04-11 at Leopardstown (8f): "O'Reilly was in at Navan but we took him out because of the ground, he loved that ground today. We'll step him up to 1m2f and maybe find a Listed race for him. In a stronger race he will jump and travel that bit better - Kate Harrington, assistant trainer."
