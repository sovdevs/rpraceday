🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ffos Las winner whose Ayr second has been franked by the winner; leading form claims
🔦 Spotlight: Won on hurdle debut at Ffos Las (2m, soft) in November and bounced back to form (after being pulled up in Grade 2) when runner-up at Ayr (2m, soft), where about 6l behind one who followed up in a Grade 2; leading claims if handling the ground (unproven on good/good to soft going).

🔦 Spotlight: French chase winner who, after a wind op, tapped back into that promise to win C&D novice hurdle (good to soft) two weeks ago on third British run; something to find with Admiral Stewart but he's the stand-out form danger.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won handicap chase at Worcester last August but needs others to underperform to land this
🔦 Spotlight: Won handicap chase at Worcester (2m4f, good) on final run for Martin Keighley but that form is nothing special; sixth on stable debut in handicap hurdle at Ayr (2m3f, good) in November; needs others to underperform.
