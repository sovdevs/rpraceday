🔦 Spotlight: C&D scorer but yet to hit top form in 2025, only 12th in 7f Catterick handicap 22 days ago; he needs to take a step forward.
Horse quote: 2019-04-28 at Wetherby (7f): "We were expecting a good run but were worried about the draw and the rain-softened ground. Saisons D'Or has proved his versatility and it opens up more options - Jedd O'Keeffe, trainer."

Horse quote: 2021-05-05 at Chester (7f): "We didn't know about the trip and if Broken Spear would stay or not but we went a nice gallop and he's just picked them off one by one. He feels like a seven furlong horse all day long and he fights as well because the others weren't going away and he just stuck his head down - Kieran Schofield, jockey."
