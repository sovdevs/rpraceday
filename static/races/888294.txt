🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 6yo could have untapped potential now tackling a marathon trip; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily here (extended 3m1f, soft) in December on fourth chase start and another good run when third of six at Uttoxeter (3m2f, good to soft) last time; also effective on good ground; this lightly raced 6yo could have untapped potential now tackling a marathon trip; firmly in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The step up in trip could be a positive move if he's back on song; wind op since last time
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up at Exeter in December but he's had wind surgery since and was in good form previously, staying on well when first at Kempton (3m, good) then third at Ascot (3m, good); this step up in trip could be a positive move if he's back on song.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 12yo who has very patchy record nowadays, but there were encouraging signs last time
🔦 Spotlight: 12yo who has been pulled up on seven of his last nine starts; however, following a fourth wind operation he returned to form with a staying-on fifth at Newbury (3m2f, soft) recently and his last three wins have come over 3m4f on good ground; capable if building on his latest performance.
