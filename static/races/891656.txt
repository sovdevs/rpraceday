🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running 7f lately, but a suspicion that this trip on a stiff track might just stretch him
🔦 Spotlight: Running well over 7f lately, finishing second of 12 at Ayr (good) six days ago; races off the same mark, but a suspicion that this trip on a stiff track might just stretch him.
Horse quote: 2023-09-19 at Listowel (7f): "Starliner has been running with credit. We thought he had a chance but he had to do the hard work on his own which leaves you vulnerable. He was good and tough - Gavin Ryan, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All five wins have come here including this race last year; back off last winning mark
🔦 Spotlight: All five wins have come here including this race last year, while he is back off the same mark as when successful back at this venue later the same month; never figured on last month's Pontefract return, but very much respected back here.
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Hamilton (8.5f): "We'll aim to go back to the track as Arkenstaar has never run a bad race there. I thought he showed a great attitude because he was being attacked from both sides. My biggest concern when speaking to Connor [Beasley, jockey] before was that there didn't look like there'd be any pace on, and he grinds it out more than anything. I'm really pleased with him, though - Michael Dods, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five-time winner here, four over this trip; should be better for his Musselburgh return
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time winner here, four over this trip; never got involved on his Musselburgh reappearance (1m, good) three weeks ago when behind Detective, but he doesn't have a great record fresh in any case; may not want the ground to dry out too much, but no surprise if he fares better; stable also runs Yellow Lemons.
