🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won 3m military race at Sandown in February; current mark may not be beyond him
🔦 Spotlight: Has missed chunks of his career but he finished with relish in a military amateurs' race at Sandown (3m, good to soft) in February on third run back from his latest layoff, and first start since wind surgery; has more to do back in a handicap but current mark may not be beyond him.
Horse quote: 2025-02-13 at Sandown (24f): "Frenchy Du Large is so genuine, he jumped brilliantly and did everything I asked so it makes the job a lot easier - Sergeant Nick Oliver. jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning hurdler who made a good impression on handicap/chase debut (2m4f); this is harder
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who made a successful hurdle debut in late 2023 and an impressive switch to fences here (2m4f, heavy) in February, albeit hard to rate the form with the only other survivors finishing legless; up 8lb, back up in trip and tackling more formidable opposition but he's promising.
Horse quote: 2025-02-26 at Bangor-on-Dee (20.5f): "I've loved Big City Roller since I won on him over hurdles at Carlisle. Fair play to Charlie [Longsdon] for a great training performance - Lilly Pinchin, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came on a ton during winter break; 3m on good ground suited latest; up 12lb and in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Has needed time but he came on a ton during a winter break, finding plenty to beat a next-time winner at Wetherby (2m4f, soft) on his return and skating round from the front at Uttoxeter (3m, good) in March; up 12lb in a significantly higher grade but he does look talented.
Horse quote: 2025-02-26 at Wetherby (19.5f): "Konfusion got a slight strain, nothing serious, which was why he's been off since Sedgefield and we hoped he'd be fit enough. He's a nice horse - Joel Parkinson, joint-trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winner at Doncaster; he ran another good race on that track when third in a competitive handicap (3m2f, good; has won on soft) in March and while he hadn't covered himself in glory in previous Aintree runs he ran right up to his recent best there 19 days ago; on the premises.
Horse quote: 2023-12-29 at Doncaster (24f): "Erne River obviously likes Doncaster. He lost his way a bit but Nick Kent has his horses in good form - Charlie Hammond, rider."

💬 Comment: Suited by good ground; good strike-rate; tended to hang latest and now goes in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who lost his unbeaten good-ground record when turned over in three-runner race at Wetherby (3m) in March, where he still might have won, despite tending to hang, but for bungling the last; fitting cheekpieces could keep him on the straight and narrow.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dropped right down weights; looked on the way back at Warwick (3m, good); hampered since
🔦 Spotlight: Losing run goes back two years but on a good mark now after a bleak spell and has been on the way back on last two completions, most recently to an 🚀 improver at Warwick (3m, good; has form on soft); hampered and unseated early in the Scottish National; revival still underway.
Horse quote: 2023-04-22 at Ayr (24f): "We won this three years ago with Molly The Dolly and we've had it in mind we wanted to come back for it with Sail Away. I had him entered for the Scottish National but that may be next year. He loves nice ground, his jumping counted for a lot and he was a fresh horse. He'll probably go for the Summer Cup at Uttoxeter unless the ground is particularly quick - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five of seven wins at Worcester; below best on latest two starts; back from break
🔦 Spotlight: Five of seven wins at Worcester but he couldn't get into the action there in August, nor at Market Rasen in October; only just above his latest winning mark last June, after a break, but there may be other days.
Horse quote: 2021-07-05 at Worcester (16f): "That was very straightforward. Dr Newland was quite keen to keep it simple, there was no pace so Tiger Orchid could go forward and do it himself - thankfully he's kept his head in front - Sam Twiston-Davies, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner at up to 2m5f but none since 2022 and he's been through troubled times in the last 12 months; this belated step up to 3m (having run over 2m last time) looks more in hope than confidence.
Horse quote: 2020-10-15 at Carlisle (17f): "Mackenberg is a nice horse, I was very happy with that. But he's still very raw and we won't rush him - Donald McCain, trainer."

💬 Comment: Had limitations beyond 2m5f in the past and has had a quiet winter; revival needed
🔦 Spotlight: Four chase wins at up to 2m5f, (soft or slower ground) and has had limitations beyond that trip, including at Carlisle in March; needs a revival on what he's shown this winter; yard also runs Frenchy Du Large.
Horse quote: 2023-12-19 at Fakenham (21f): "This looked an ideal opportunity for Georges Saint, who is not a novice and basically he has just outstayed them. I thought we were booked for third at the second-last but the two leaders just fell in a heap - Jerry Roberts, spokesman for trainer Venetia Williams."
