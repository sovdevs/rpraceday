🔦 Spotlight: Left previous handicap form miles behind when easily making all in first-time cheekpieces (retained) over C&D (good) last Wednesday; she's basically just 3lb higher today under a penalty; could take plenty of beating.

🔦 Spotlight: Has a 1-20 strike-rate and he could do with settling better than at Nottingham 12 days ago, but he's run well to be placed on his three outings for this stable (1m, AW/good) and could be bang there.

🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent sort who is just 1-21 on turf compared to 4-12 on AW; however, he has a lower mark in this sphere and his sole win on grass came here; went close at Southwell (1m, AW) last month and he's one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has a better strike-rate on AW than turf but could nevertheless have a part to play
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Southwell (1m, AW) last month and kept on for good third there (7f) on Sunday in a first-time visor (now left off); he's 8-52 on AW as opposed to 1-13 on turf but he ran fairly well on grass at Doncaster two starts ago and could have a part to play in this less competitive race.
Horse quote: 2024-02-15 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "I couldn't understand the price, we thought this was a penalty kick. Al Suil Eile was entered at Wolverhampton but this extra meeting came on and it was perfect for him. It felt like a gift really. He's been a star for us this year. He's taken a while and he's had his problems but this year his joints and everything are good. He'll come back to Southwell for a 0-70 on the Sunday night, March 10. It's treble the prize money and it's the same sort of race. I can't see the handicapper going too mad, a couple more pounds maybe and that will be fine. - Shaun Harris, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't threatened across his five starts (handicaps the last twice) but he ran okay when ninth of 21 on last month's reappearance at Doncaster (1m, good) and the visor is a possible source of improvement; not discounted.
