🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Clear second over 7f here latest and he looks worth another try at this trip; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Has form figures of 3132 over 7f here this year and that latest run was a clear second behind an 🚀 improver 25 days ago; faded in previous attempt at 1m but he looks worth another try at this trip and is respected off only 1lb higher than last time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still has potential and needs a close look at this new trip on her return; hood added
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning handicap debut over 7f here in September; disappointing at Brighton next time but she bounced back with a good third from off the pace here in her final run last season; headgear is now added at this new trip but she still has potential and is a half-sister to a 1m winner; needs a close look on return.

💬 Comment: Eyecatching third here in October and looks interesting upped to 1m on her return
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 0-8 but she went close in a Thirsk nursery (6f, good to soft) in September and ended last season with an eyecatching third at this track (7f); did best of the closers in that race and she looks interesting upped to 1m on return; stablemate of Bantz.
