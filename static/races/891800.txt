🔦 Spotlight: Struggled in her novice runs but the switch to handicaps and addition of a tongue-tie saw her show marked improvement, third at Windsor before gamely winning at Brighton (1m4f, soft); open to further progress this year and returns to action off a feasible mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two turf wins in her youth; lightly raced in recent seasons; enough to prove for now
🔦 Spotlight: Two turf wins for former trainers; only seen twice since August 2023 and neither run has suggested she would be the answer this time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runaway 2m win in November needs treating with extreme caution; opposable on balance
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the 16th attempt when allowed to poach a huge advantage in a 2m handicap here in November; well beaten back here when last seen in December; 3lb out of the weights and others are safer.
Horse quote: 2024-11-19 at Lingfield (AW) (16f): "I said to Tyrese if there was no pace to let Certain Style bowl along, but it was pretty diabolical from the riders in behind - Ian Mongan, assistant trainer."
