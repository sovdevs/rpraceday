💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner, including three weeks ago; could enjoy the run of the race; every chance
🔦 Spotlight: Handy sort who has gained two of her four wins over C&D, the latest in a similar contest three weeks ago; a repeat would give her every chance of a follow-up and, with few prominent racers lined up against her, she could enjoy the run of the race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole win in 28 starts came over C&D, but out of form lately and drawn widest
🔦 Spotlight: 1-28, his win coming in a 0-53 handicap over C&D early last year; not in much form lately, though, and opposable from the outside stall.
