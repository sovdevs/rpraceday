🔦 Spotlight: Improved as his stamina was drawn out as a 3yo and he ended 2024 with comfortable wins at Ayr (1m5f, good) and C&D; hit with an 8lb rise for the latter win and he returns from an absence minus his usual cheekpieces.

💬 Comment: Five wins from 1m-1m2f; stamina for this new trip has to be taken on trust
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins (1m-1m2f) since handicapping; solid effort upped to 1m3f here 15 days ago (tongue tied for the first time) but stamina for this trip has to be taken on trust; the fact his Iffraaj half-brother Bodygroove is a 1m6f winner offers hope, though.
