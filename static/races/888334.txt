🔦 Spotlight: 7yo who has form figures of 231213 since the end of August and his last success came at this track (1m7f, good to soft); held in 4l third when favourite here last month but that was a solid effort after a break and he should be sharper this time; respected.

💬 Comment: Two hurdle wins for current yard and she resumed her progress when runner-up here latest
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Lingfield (2m, good) in November on her second stable start and followed up here (1m7f good to soft) in December; flopped in hat-trick bid at Doncaster but she bounced back with big-field second here last month and that was a personal best under Tom Broughton; respected.
