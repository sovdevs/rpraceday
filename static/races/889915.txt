🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner in France before chasing home Laafi on yard debut at Limerick; bounced back from a lesser run over 2m4f when chasing home Ethical Diamond (beaten 10l) to finish second of 22 at Punchestown last month; a couple of those in behind from last time have run respectably in maiden hurdles since and his dam stayed this trip; nice prospect.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in the Grade 1 Punchestown Champion Bumper in 2022 and went one better in that same race last season; was a bit disappointing when fourth of 17 in a Leopardstown maiden on belated hurdle bow and was tailed off having jumped poorly behind Kopek Des Bordes; 🔥 big player if he can get to the level of his bumper form.
