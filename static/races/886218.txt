🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Longstanding maiden but the return to Musselburgh and the tongue-tie could be positives
🔦 Spotlight: Longstanding maiden who was soundly beaten at Newcastle last time in a first-time hood (retained); however, he's run pretty well on both previous visits to Musselburgh and the tongue-tie is back on today, which he wore when a fair fourth over C&D (good to soft) in November; interesting contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Perhaps soft ground didn't suit last time; encouraging fourth previously; not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Has a poor strike-rate and was well beaten at Ayr last time; however, perhaps the soft ground didn't suit and prior to that he was a respectable fourth of 16 at Newcastle (2m4f, good) on his second stable start; likely to be back on better ground today and he's not discounted.

🔦 Spotlight: Below best the last twice but didn't quite see out 3m here last time; three starts ago he was a fair third over today's C&D (good to soft) and he's not ruled out in first-time cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair 6th over 3m here recently; this C&D winner could be in the mix now back down in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Faded late on when fair sixth here (3m, good to soft) a fortnight ago on her first run since wind surgery; her two wins last spring came over 2m4f (including C&D) and she could be in the mix now back down in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not obviously well treated off his opening mark but the step up in trip could suit
🔦 Spotlight: He's not obviously well treated off his opening mark but there was a small hint of promise on his debut at Bangor (2m, good to soft) in November, when he was well beaten but keeping on when stumbling/falling two out, and the step up in trip could suit in his first handicap; watch the betting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11-race maiden but runner-up over C&D in November and has strong claims on that form
🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 and not quite at best when sixth at Catterick last time but he was a good second off this mark over C&D (good to soft) in November and a reproduction of that form would give him strong claims in this weak race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two lesser runs have followed since fair Ayr 5th, but he could bounce back on h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won an Irish maiden point (3m, yielding) last March and ran okay when fifth of seven on hurdle debut at Ayr (2m, good to soft) in October; two lesser runs have followed (2m1f/2m4f) but it will be no surprise if he bounces back with a good performance in a first-time hood on handicap debut.
