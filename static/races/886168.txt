🔦 Spotlight: Won three staying handicaps in succession in 2023 (soft/good to soft) but hasn't been in quite such good form since; probably found the ground too testing when pulled up at Haydock last time; a bit to prove at present.

💬 Comment: Placed in 2 UK points; won maiden hurdle on stable/rules debut; interesting on h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two UK points before getting off the mark on rules/stable debut when winning a Hexham maiden hurdle in June (2m4f, good; form fair); below his best in a Carlisle novice last time (2m4f, good to soft); quite interesting on handicap debut after a break since October.

🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £3,000 out of Tom Lacey's yard at Doncaster last May having won two Catterick handicaps over 1m7f earlier in the year; this ground fine and not disgraced when tried over 2m4f/3m; probably best watched on stable debut having been off since April.
