🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not had many chances at this sort of trip; two 1m2f Newcastle wins in 2025; respected
🔦 Spotlight: She's not had a lot of chances at this sort of trip and has been in fine form this year, winning her second 1m2f race at Newcastle more readily than the neck margin suggests; up 3lb; didn't appear beaten by the 1m3f trip here the time before and looks worth another go at it; good claims.

💬 Comment: Did well to win 1m2f Lingfield classified; lacked pace over 1m since; remains of interest
🔦 Spotlight: Overcame a troubled passage when getting up late to win a 1m2f classified at Lingfield on second start for this yard but he just couldn't pick up over the shorter trip at Wolverhampton (about 1m) next time; unraced here but acts on Tapeta and remains of interest with more suitable test.

🔦 Spotlight: Not yet managed a win but in good form for this yard and in theory there shouldn't be much between him and Eva Rosie on Newcastle form (1m2f) last month; has more to prove on previous runs at 1m3f, though.

💬 Comment: Minor form since promising debut as 3yo and faded on handicap debut at about 1m; new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Promising debut last spring but she completed her qualifying runs with two minor efforts and, although worth a go at this trip on pedigree, she didn't look to be wanting to go any further when not finding much on handicap debut at Wolverhampton (extended 1m) in March.

💬 Comment: On a losing run and off for a year; right down weights and has C&D form; 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-David Simcock; losing run goes back three years and he's been off for a year but he has won on Fibresand here and was 22lb higher than today than when going close over C&D in 2022; likely to need a run or two but worth looking out for with the future in mind.
