🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not always a fluent jumper and has mixed record this season but ran well 18 days ago
🔦 Spotlight: Has very mixed record over fences this season but overcame a lack of fluency to win at Huntingdon (2m7f, good to soft) in November and stuck to her task very well when second at Southwell (3m, good to soft) this month; 🔥 big player if she gets into a fairly good rhythm here.

💬 Comment: Won three times last season but returned with two disappointing runs in the autumn
🔦 Spotlight: Took very well to fences last season, winning three times over 3m (good to soft-soft), but returned with two disappointing runs in the autumn; needs to get back on track and will have something to prove if the ground stays good (unraced on anything quicker than good to soft).

🔦 Spotlight: Nothing like the force of old and yet to be placed after five starts for Evan Williams but last month's Lingfield fifth (2m7f, heavy) was a step back in the right direction and he's far too well handicapped to be ruled out here, albeit he'd appeal more on slower ground.
