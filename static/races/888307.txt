🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bangor win (3m6f) last February and 2nd here (3m2f) latest, both on heavy; first blinkers
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Bangor (3m6f) last February and back to form when he battled on for second behind an improving winner at this track (3m2f) this January, both in cheekpieces which are now replaced by first-time blinkers; it's hard to ignore that they were also both on heavy going but he did win a maiden hurdle on good in 2023; major case can be made.

💬 Comment: Emerged from the doldrums to score at Warwick (3m, soft)  in second-time blinkers latest
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wincanton (2m4f, soft) last April and emerged from the doldrums to score at Warwick (3m, soft; up 5lb today) four weeks ago in second-time blinkers; pulled up in December on sole attempt beyond 3m (extended 3m1f, heavy) but that last-time-out win came in clearcut style from the front.

💬 Comment: 11l win at Lingfield (2m7f, soft) last month from Twilight Glory; not so good week later
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who returned to his very best with easy 11l win at Lingfield (2m7f, soft; seemingly fine on good) last month from Twilight Glory; not so good under a penalty at Ludlow one week later; stays 3m3f; probably needs to be back at his peak but he's clearly one to consider seriously.

💬 Comment: Second run after six months off; usual cheekpieces return (absent last time)
🔦 Spotlight: Tried an extended 3m3f at Stratford (furthest he's been; good to firm) last August and gave easily the best show among his last eight starts, albeit markedly below his 2023 form; no show three weeks ago over hurdles after six months off (20-1); his usual cheekpieces return (absent last time) and it will be interesting to see if there's more market strength.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Position 13lb out of the handicap confirms this as a tough task
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win (25 races) was in November 2023; seemingly back in good form when second at Southwell (3m, soft) in January but well below that level since, including behind two of these at Lingfield on penultimate start; position 13lb out of the handicap confirms this as a tough task.
