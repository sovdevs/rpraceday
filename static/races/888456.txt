🔦 Spotlight: Remains a maiden but has chased home an 🚀 improver and a subsequent winner in two starts since handicapping; latest effort can be marked up a touch too, so he's shortlisted off a mark just 1lb higher.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Another improved effort over C&D three days ago in a race not run to suit; leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Another improved effort over C&D three days ago, when coming clear of the rest in a race not run to suit (winner given a canny ride in front); won three in a row before that; will likely be dropped in again from the outside stall and the harder they go the better it will be for him.
