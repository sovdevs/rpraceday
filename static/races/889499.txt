💬 Comment: First completion for this yard when 80-1 third at Southwell; wasn't beaten far
🔦 Spotlight: Showed bits of promise for Henry De Bromhead; now 0-11 but it was her first completion for this yard when an 80-1 third at Southwell (2m4f handicap on good to soft) and was beaten under 6l; clear chance if building on that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First completion for this yard when 80-1 third at Southwell; wasn't beaten far
🔦 Spotlight: Showed bits of promise for Henry De Bromhead; now 0-11 but it was her first completion for this yard when an 80-1 third at Southwell (2m4f handicap on good to soft) and was beaten under 6l; clear chance if building on that.
