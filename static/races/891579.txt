💬 Comment: Well-bred 120,000gns yearling; ✂️ gelded since last year's debut, but was tailed off at 100-1
🔦 Spotlight: It's very early days for this 120,000gns yearling, whose dam was a 1m4f Group 2 winner, and he's been ✂️ gelded since his sole run at Lingfield (1m, AW) last November; one to watch in the betting but he was tailed off at 100-1 and a dramatic transformation is required.
