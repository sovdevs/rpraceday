🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Remains well handicapped and will be a danger to all if on a going day
🔦 Spotlight: Seemingly landed some nice bets at Wolverhampton in December (6f) but was soundly beaten under a 5lb penalty over C&D three days later (sent off 4-6; has won four times here); is 3lb lower racing off his revised mark here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Can build on return fifth if this doesn't come too soon
🔦 Spotlight: Form of November 2023 Chelmsford maiden win isn't up to much; only run since, following a gelding operation, when left poorly placed and managing fifth of eight at Wolverhampton 11 days ago; chance if this doesn't come too soon and he builds on that.

📝 Comment: 🔄 held up in rear, some headway going easily 2f out, edged right over 1f out, ⚠️ not clear run repeatedly inside final furlong, nudged along when in the clear inside final 110yds, ⏳ ran on well, eyecatcher (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said that her instructions were to jump out of stalls and get gelding travelling at an even pace and into a rhythm as gelding has a history of respiratory issues having previously had a wind operation at another yard; jockey said that being mindful that gelding was slow into stride, she didn't want to chase him up and force him into stride as he is a big horse with a high head carriage and can become unbalanced easily; she added that her main aim was to keep gelding balanced and travelling through the field and finish the race to obtain best possible placing; she further added that gelding became unbalanced approximately 3 1/2f out and felt it took time for horse to find his feet again before asking him to mount his challenge; she further said that she was denied a clear run continuously for approximately 1f, a fact she reported at scales and that due to this she was unable to ride gelding as vigorously as she would have liked for fear of clipping heels of runners in front of her; jockey finally said she was only able to ask for a more serious effort in concluding stages having eventually gained a clear run; trainer confirmed instructions and was satisfied that ride accorded with those instructions under the circumstances that gelding was denied a clear run for a substantial part of race; their explanations were noted)

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reasons to expect much better here; interesting to see what the market makes of him
🔦 Spotlight: Might have needed his stable debut three weeks ago (where he drifted to 16-1), could be perked up by the fitting of headgear (cheekpieces) and some of his form from last summer/autumn reads well; interesting to see what the market makes of him.

💬 Comment: First start here and could at least get closer to Northcliff
🔦 Spotlight: Same mark as when beating 20 rivals at York last summer; travelled well before possibly hindered by racing towards the far side when three places behind Northcliff at Newcastle 18 days ago; in with a shout on course debut.
