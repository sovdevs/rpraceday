üí¨ Comment: 8lb higher today and missed his final prep race but he was impressive in this last year
üî¶ Spotlight: Far from a natural jumper but that matters a lot less in this race these days and the turbo has kicked in when he's moved into marathon territory; that resulted first in a last-gasp win in the 2023 Irish National and then a storming success in this race last year, both on soft; hugging the inner seemed to help somewhat with his jumping 12 months ago; 8lb higher this time and forced to miss his final prep race (with an infection) but he was mightily impressive in the closing stages last year.

üî¶ Spotlight: Very weak in the betting when running moderately over 2m4f on heavy going five weeks ago, a sixth chase run he needed to qualify for this; second in the Irish Gold Cup (3m, yielding) one month earlier was a career best but the handicapper has been able to take that into account today, so this major step up in trip demands another new high.
