💬 Comment: Best effort over 20.5f on good in a Cork maiden, lacks a run but ground will suit, chance
🔦 Spotlight: 0-2 in bumpers and 0-2 over hurdles; best effort a 0.5l second in a 20.5f Cork maiden hurdle in October, his sole start on good ground; off since 10.5l hurdles defeat at Wexford (2m4f, yielding) when sent off the 9/4 favourite; could go well back in a bumper on ground he'll like if fit after a 158-day absence.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best effort over 20.5f on good in a Cork maiden, lacks a run but ground will suit, chance
🔦 Spotlight: 0-2 in bumpers and 0-2 over hurdles; best effort a 0.5l second in a 20.5f Cork maiden hurdle in October, his sole start on good ground; off since 10.5l hurdles defeat at Wexford (2m4f, yielding) when sent off the 9/4 favourite; could go well back in a bumper on ground he'll like if fit after a 158-day absence.
