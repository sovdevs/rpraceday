💬 Comment: Easily made all over C&D last month; up 9lb and it was a small field but form reads well
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row last spring (2m, soft) and back on song when easily making all in small field over C&D (soft) last month; hit with a 9lb rise but the second and the third have both run well since; has to be respected.

💬 Comment: Two hurdle wins here and this point winner is open to further improvement on chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Dead-heated for first over hurdles here (2m, good) in March 2023 and made it 2-7 in that sphere when winning by 6l here (2m5f, soft) on New Year's Day on second start back from a long absence; this lightly raced point winner is open to further improvement now tackling fences; one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from his last 18 starts but frequently placed and stayed on for second from out of the handicap here (2m1f, soft) last month; runs off the same mark today and the step back up in trip may well be a positive, with his last win having come over 2m3f; could again be thereabouts.

🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-14 over fences and needs to run better than on his two starts this winter, but he twice finished runner-up off higher marks last spring and perhaps the first-time cheekpieces will give him a boost; not discounted.

🔦 Spotlight: Dead-heated for first over hurdles here (2m, good) in March 2023 and made it 2-7 in that sphere when winning by 6l here (2m5f, soft) on New Year's Day on second start back from a long absence; this lightly raced point winner is open to further improvement now tackling fences; one to consider.
