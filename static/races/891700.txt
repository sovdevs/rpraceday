🔦 Spotlight: Never appeared in a handicap over hurdles (Chepstow maiden winner) but has run in two handicaps on the switch to chasing, second of six at Wincanton (3m1f, good to soft; unraced on firmer) in January when last seen; so lightly raced, he should build on that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dropped another 5lb in his 745-day absence; needs a close look despite stable form
🔦 Spotlight: Dual chase winner early in 2022 (3m1f/2m7f) and minor honours in February-April 2023 when last seen; dropped another 5lb in his absence and although it's over a month since his stable had a winner, he needs a close look.
Horse quote: 2022-03-05 at Newbury (23.5f): "Fuji Flight has got a very short, choppy stride, so he doesn't strike you as a horse who goes that quickly. The ground is nowhere near as soft as I hoped. He was flat out from the word go, but was able to keep in touch - Venetia Williams, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: His last four outings have seen him runner-up twice and pulled up twice; that makes him 2-14 over hurdles, with the two wins early in 2023 before he went handicapping; no problems with trip or ground but he does not appear the most reliable proposition on this switch to chasing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of form this season; a lot seems to depend on the wind surgery since latest outing
🔦 Spotlight: Won well three times on soft ground last January-March; ended that campaign on a low note and has not recaptured his form this season, so a lot seems to depend on the wind surgery he's had since latest outing.
Horse quote: 2024-03-19 at Wetherby (19.5f): "We had a couple of entries in this race and were keen to run something. Carrigeen Castle looks a progressive horse. He'll probably have one more run then we'll look forward to next season with him - Micky Hammond, trainer."
