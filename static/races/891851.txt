🔦 Spotlight: A fair bumper winner but he beat just one on the back of a wind op in 1m4f Ascot novice last October; lots more is required.
Horse quote: 2024-02-18 at Southwell (16f): "I was a little bit concerned this morning about the ground but I thought Stavvy would handle this nice flat track, a bit like Donny, so it was worth coming here. We will school him (over hurdles) for sure but I think if you got very heavy going on the Saturday of Royal Ascot, he might pitch up for the Queen Alexandra - Jane Chapple-Hyam, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
