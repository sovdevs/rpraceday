🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Nearly all races over shorter and didn't prove stamina for 1m4f in slowly run race latest
🔦 Spotlight: Nearly all races over shorter (sole AW win over 7f in 2023) and he didn't prove stamina for 1m4f when runner-up in a slowly run race at Wolverhampton recently; up in the air as to how the closing stages will go.

💬 Comment: Last three wins here, most recently in a C&D classified; likely to be involved again
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins on Tapeta here; went through a quiet spell last year but he's a regular winner down the years and benefited from a drop in grade when winning a C&D classified on the nod 12 days ago; back up just 1lb and has less to prove than most.
