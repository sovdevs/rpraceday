🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seventh at Cheltenham; 3-5 over fences with easy win at Ayr; dangerous mark back hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: Weakened up the hill when seventh in 2m4f Jack Richards at Cheltenham Festival; made it 3-5 over fences with easy win in Ayr premier handicap chase (16.5f, good to soft) off 138 last month; lurking off dangerous mark back hurdling.
Horse quote: 2025-04-12 at Ayr (16.5f): "I bought him The Other Mozzie for Cheltenham, I wanted a few runners and I've always wanted to have a horse with Gavin so I took a chance and it's worked out.  He won well. I was standing with my brother Scott and I saw him coming on the bridle - I said 'please just jump the fences!' It was great, what a victory. I love the National Hunt and I'm just trying to get better quality horses coming through. He looks like he's one of them - Jimmy Fyffe, owner."

🔦 Spotlight: Ran well in defeat several times in Flat maidens for Johnny Murtagh; bled on hurdles debut in December but much better since, getting off the mark in Clonmel maiden (2m1f, good to yielding) two weeks ago; his jumping will need to improve on handicap debut but respected.

💬 Comment: Followed up in style off 106 at Limerick although this is a much deeper field; more needed
🔦 Spotlight: Placed six times over hurdles before finally getting off the mark narrowly at Wexford (2m, good to yielding) off 100; followed up in style off 106 at Limerick (2m, good) although this is a much deeper field; will need to pull out more.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second to Puturhandstogether on final start for Joseph O'Brien; eyecatcher on latest
🔦 Spotlight: Came up short in the Fred Winter at Cheltenham (wore cheekpieces and tongue-tie) but had previously been second to Fred Winter winner Puturhandstogether in big-field Cork maiden on final start for Joseph O'Brien; big eyecatcher when second at Newcastle on latest when weak in the betting; big showing anticipated for yard that had impressive handicap winner at the meeting on Tuesday.
Horse quote: 2025-01-31 at Catterick (15.5f): "It was a messy, unsatisfactory race and Turn And Finish was well short of maximum fitness. He came over from Joseph [O'Brien, trainer] and we gave him a break when he got here. We just wanted to give him a race to help with our preparations for the Fred Winter. That's nowhere near his best and he'll be much better in a strongly run race coming off the pace. His Irish form also suggests that. It's job done, though, and all roads lead to the Cheltenham Festival. He'll be a much, much better horse in the middle of March. He jumps well and travels strongly and looks a hurdling type, and for most of that race he was looking around and thinking what was going on. I think 24 runners going flat out in front of him will be much better - Harry Derham, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Down Royal maiden hurdle in January; never involved in Grade 2 at Kelso; handicap bow
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in Listed bumper at four; off the mark on second start over hurdles when landing Down Royal maiden (2m1f, good to yielding) in January; tongue-tied when big price and never involved in Grade 2 novice at Kelso; handicap debut; monitor the market.
Horse quote: 2025-01-21 at Down Royal (17f): "It has just taken a while for everything to fall into place. Putapoundinthejar is still relatively young and immature. Today's race turned into a great opportunity with Willie's not there. We always thought he was a nice young horse and we still do - Tony Martin, trainer."

💬 Comment: Leopardstown winner was third to Mercury Mission on handicap debut and first 2 won since
🔦 Spotlight: Leopardstown maiden hurdle (2m, yielding) winner was creditable third behind Mercury Mission on handicap debut at Wexford and the first two have won since; should be competitive off this mark; each-way possibilities.
Horse quote: 2025-03-02 at Leopardstown (16f): "We have eventually got it right with Solsbury Hill. We've tried everything - different trips, put a hood on him the last day and took it off today. In fairness to Charlie he was adamant that he wanted to drop him in and get him switched off down the inner, but it was fairly rough early on. There was a lot of hustle and bustle. He was probably a little bit further back than he wanted to be, but Charlie was adamant that once he switches off, he has plenty of pace. They went a strong pace and it all worked out well for him. He jumped super down the back and produced a nice turn of foot. He'll definitely go chasing next season as he jumps a fence super and is a nice one to look forward to - Conor O'Dwyer, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: In good form over both hurdles and fences last summer on good ground, winning over hurdles here over 2m3f off 102; runner-up over fences at Limerick in March but below best when midfield in Naas handicap hurdle four weeks ago; others preferred.
Horse quote: 2022-09-02 at Kilbeggan (19f): "Sargent Lightfoot loves it here and that's his second win this year. He jumped well except for one fence. We were hoping he'd finish in the first three or four but thought it would be a big step for him to win. I'd say we might look at a hurdle race again for him - Adrian Murray, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Tramore maiden hurdle (16.5f, good) winner last August; dual Flat winner was only caught late when third at Leopardstown (1m) in March but poor there on latest; one of the likely pace angles but struggled on sole handicap start in this sphere last October.
Horse quote: 2024-08-18 at Tramore (16.5f): "Expound has plenty of ability and it's good the way he can mix it between both [codes]. When he won his [Flat] maiden he made the running and Denis [Hogan, trainer] said to keep it simple, he likes to make the running and let the horses try and catch him. He was very good from the front, jumped really well and travelled and when they came to him he picked up and done it nicely in the end - Daniel King, jockey, speaking to RTV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All three wins have been on soft ground; pulled up at Fairyhouse off this mark 11 days ago
🔦 Spotlight: All three wins have been on soft ground; impressive winner of 20-runner Gowran handicap hurdle off 98 in March but was pulled up at Fairyhouse off this mark 11 days ago; uphill task.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Gowran Park (16f): "Battle Of Ridgeway looked the winner here the last day coming to the second-last the last day over fences. He just didn't get home after running with the choke out but he was way more relaxed today stepping back in trip. He's a real chaser but was always a moral to win a race over hurdles off his (12lb lower) mark. The boys wanted a runner today and it was the only suitable race so it's pot luck he's run over hurdles. We'll probably go back over fences as he's a natural chaser - Martin Hassett, trainer."
