🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten in first two handicap hurdles but was strong in the betting both times
🔦 Spotlight: Unable to justify prominence in the betting in two handicap hurdles in January (2m4f/2m3f), albeit ran well for a long way on second occasion, and did not show a great deal on his three subsequent Flat starts; drops back to 2m and has first-time tongue-tie fitted today; still 🔍 unexposed under rules and it will be interesting to see whether his supporters wade in again.

🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced all eight hurdling starts but took big step in right direction when very respectable fifth of 14 at Clonmel (2m, soft) last month, and runners from his stable always need close attention in the betting.

🔦 Spotlight: Consistent over hurdles for Gary and Josh Moore this season, albeit often in plating company; raced too freely and made low-key stable debut on the Flat last week but has usual cheekpieces refitted for this return to hurdling and enters calculations.
