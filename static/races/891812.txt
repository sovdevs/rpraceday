🔦 Spotlight: Placed in 6f AW handicaps the last twice, one place behid Hala Joza when third at Lingfield two weeks ago; suspicion she'll need another step forward if she is two make it 15th time lucky.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: From a fine family; should leave her 2yo form behind her now handicapping at a low level
🔦 Spotlight: Ran to just a modest level in three 6f novice/maiden runs last autumn; bred to be much better than this mark, however, and the addition of a tongue-tie could see her take a good step forward on her handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor form so far but several reasons to expect a more prominent showing today
🔦 Spotlight: She has a useful sprinting pedigree and two of her three runs in novice/maiden company have come over 7f; appeals as a likely big 🚀 improver now handicapping at a low level over 6f in a new visor and the booking of Silvestre de Sousa (8-64 for the yard with a further 19 placed) also looks a plus.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6f win at Wolverhampton in January; behind some of these on stable debut (wide draw)
🔦 Spotlight: Benefitted from the addition of blinkers when making all in a 6f handicap at Wolverhampton in January; no progress since, including on his stable debut two weeks ago (not well drawn and used up a lot of energy to get to the front), but could step forward from that run in a new tongue-tie.
