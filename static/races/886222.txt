🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6yo novice who has been showing strong and 📈 progressive form, and he's a key player
🔦 Spotlight: Bumped into thriving winner when short-headed over C&D (soft) in December on second chase start then went one better at Aintree (3m1f, soft); creditable second at Windsor (3m4f, soft) last time and this 6yo could continue his 📈 progressive ways with another big run today; key player.

🔦 Spotlight: 11yo whose strike-rate over fences had become modest for one of his ability but he won at Huntingdon (2m7f, good) in November after a break and followed up at Leicester (2m6f, good to soft) six days later; remains well treated on old form and he should be fine on soft/good to soft ground; respected.

🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up at Kelso (4m, soft) last time but was challenging four out; prior to that he was a good second over this C&D (good) and that form has worked out extremely well; also effective on soft ground; could play a leading role now back down in trip in first-time cheekpieces.
