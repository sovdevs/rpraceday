💬 Comment: Well backed and won easily on his Newcastle debut 6 weeks ago; new trip should suit; solid
🔦 Spotlight: Even-money favourite for his Newcastle debut six weeks ago (6f) and his supporters rarely had an anxious moment, as he tanked through the race and settling matters quickly over 1f out; bred to be well suited by 7f and he's a major player with further progress likely.

💬 Comment: Promising stable debut at Newcastle last week (7f) where a stronger pace would have helped
🔦 Spotlight: Up and down in four outings as a 2yo, best effort when a close third in 1m maiden at Bellewstown (good ground) on third of them; promising stable debut when second of eight at Newcastle last week (7f), racing freely in a maiden that developed into a sprint; the addition of a hood could help and he's a leading contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Up and down in four outings as a 2yo, best effort when a close third in 1m maiden at Bellewstown (good ground) on third of them; promising stable debut when second of eight at Newcastle last week (7f), racing freely in a maiden that developed into a sprint; the addition of a hood could help and he's a leading contender.
