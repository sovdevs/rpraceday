🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On the up on good to soft for A Charlton; more to give for 🆕 new yard if the ground is okay
🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles in 15-runner handicap at Taunton (2m3f) in November and readily doubled his tally in another big field at Wincanton (1m7f, again good to soft) on Boxing Day; good fourth of 16 at Taunton (2m3f) in January and has since left Tony Charlton; ridden by 7lb claimer on last three starts; more to give if the ground is okay.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Step back in right direction here latest, despite looking stretched by the extended 2m3f
🔦 Spotlight: 1-11 over hurdles, the win delivered at this course last February on heavy going; just 1lb higher today and he took a step back in the right direction when third here (good to soft) on latest start, despite looking stretched by the extended 2m3f, so he needs a second look.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Irish maiden on rules debut last June; soundly beaten both British starts; h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Roscommon maiden hurdle (extended 1m7f, good) on rules debut last June; soundly beaten on both British starts, admittedly at 66-1 over C&D on latest start, so that form may not look too bad, but markedly better is needed on this handicap debut.
