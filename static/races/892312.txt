🔦 Spotlight: Stable stalwart the winner of 10 of 22 races including twice at Group 3 level here last summer and C&D Group 2 second arguably better form; ended season winning Cork Listed; has never raced on ground this quick but goes on any other; carries a penalty but still probably the one to beat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Just fourth career start here so potential for more but big ask
🔦 Spotlight: Mare having only her fourth career start here, having won 1m1f Gowran maiden last summer but too keen and didn't stay in 1m2f Dundalk Listed three months later; connections keen to persevere so could still have improvement in her but this looks a big ask.
