🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat one rival when taking this last year, good run on latest at Thurles, the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: One of two for top yard; won this easily last year on testing ground but only faced one rival; ran respectably in the Grade 2 Galmoy Hurdle in January and got to within 5l of Hewick returned to chasing at Thurles on latest; top rated at 157 and should be hard to beat.
Horse quote: 2024-03-31 at Cork (24f): "Asterion Forlonge is a good horse. We went a nice gallop, didn't hang around and it is nice to get another win with him - Sean O'Keeffe, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-15 over fences, gets 6lb from top two, pulled up in Grand National latest, needs revival
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner over hurdles; 2-15 in chases including a listed win in a two-runner race at Thurles (22.5f, good) in November; didn't run badly when tried over 24.5f at Fairyhouse in February but pulled up in the Grand National latest; gets 6lb from the top two here but needs to bounce back.
Horse quote: 2024-11-28 at Thurles (22.5f): "It was very straightforward and fairly routine. It would have been a surprise if Fil Dor had been beaten as he was rated a lot higher than the other horse. He really showed some glimmers of his old form the last day in Clonmel, so hopefully it is onwards and upwards - Jack Kennedy, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-6 over fences, pulled up last twice, unproven at 3m, lacks a recent run, best watched
🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for yard; two-time hurdles winner is three from six over fences; back to back wins last year in a Punchestown novice (2m, heavy) Grade 3 novice at Thurles (2m2f heavy); pulled up both starts since over 2m4f and 22.5f so has stamina to prove and lacks a run; watch.
Horse quote: 2024-03-16 at Thurles (18f): "Mister Policeman jumped fantastic, he loved it today and is really getting the hang of it. He got a lot of confidence from the last day and he has built on that again today - Paul Townend, rider."
