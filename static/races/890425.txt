🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the first of two starts last season; handicap debutant who could be capable of better
🔦 Spotlight: Green but well on top late on to justify 5-4 favouritism in a five-runner restricted maiden at Ripon (1m2f, good) last August on debut; not so good at Redcar (1m2f, soft) two months later but this handicap debutant could clearly still be capable of better after just two starts.
Horse quote: 2024-08-26 at Ripon (10f): "That was a lovely introduction. I've never been to Ripon before but I had a walk round and it's quite undulating. Sir Edward Lear was learning on the job, Sean gave him a lovely ride - James Owen, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Irish Flat wins last year and he's since scored twice on good to soft over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Had Irish Flat wins last August (10.5f) and December (1m4f) and he's scored twice on good to soft from this year's five hurdle races for 🆕 new yard; that hurdles form compares favourably with this Flat mark.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Wincanton (15f): "Chicago Storm's work has been very good at home, I can't fault him, and he'll probably go on to better things. I have nothing in mind yet, but he's a very straightforward and easy horse, and he has plenty of ability - Daisy Hitchins, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 7yo whose 11 wins were all over 7f, including two last year (May/July) off slightly higher marks than this; rather inconsistent this term but today's trip (he's unraced beyond 8.6f) asks the biggest question.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Doncaster (7f): "Thapa Vc is quite a tricky ride, he's got to be produced right, and Jim is just class - Mark Rimell, trainer."

💬 Comment: 20-1 and tongue tied on yard debut (Cavalry Call second) and shaped okay in fifth of nine
🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent during light career in Ireland for Willie McCreery but he won a 9.5f maiden at Clonmel (good) last September; 20-1 and tongue tied on stable debut at Chelmsford (1m2f, AW; Cavalry Call second) 17 days ago and shaped okay in fifth of nine; considered.
Horse quote: 2024-09-05 at Clonmel (9.5f): "Golden Circet came on the bridle in the straight and quickened up well. He galloped all the way to the line in spite of going left, I just didn't want to break his stride and I let him come across - Billy Lee, rider."
