💬 Comment: 4-13 over timber, rated 116, two-time claimer winner, off track a long time, check market
🔦 Spotlight: Joint top rated at 116; 4-13 over hurdles including two claimer wins; won a 2m handicap at Fairyhouse (soft) in October 2023 off 108; off since heavy defeat in listed handicap at Naas in November 2023; well-treated by race conditions but might just need this run; keep an eye on the market.
Horse quote: 2023-10-07 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Getting Must Meet Cecil's head in front in the first claimer really helped him and he's enjoying it a lot more now. He was passed up the run-in but battled back, it was a very brave effort. He'll stay going now as long as the ground doesn't get too heavy - Cian Collins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner, 0-8 over hurdles, rated 104, rain would be a plus, not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: One of three for top yard; bumper winner is 0-8 over hurdles and rated 104; best efforts on soft and heavy ground so the forecast rain would increase his chance; not discounted with jockey taking off 7lb.
