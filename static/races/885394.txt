🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disqualified from first at Newbury and clearly capable of winning a race of this nature
🔦 Spotlight: Was failing to live up to his initial promise but then finished first in a novice at Newbury (extended 2m4f; soft) only to be disqualified for his jockey using the whip above the permitted limit; clearly capable of winning a race of this nature.

🔦 Spotlight: Positives to take from all his runs (hooded the last twice); the latest here (2m novice, soft) was run in dense fog but after a prominent ride he emerged from the gloom to finish 2l off a smart prospect; has strong form claims and he's bred for this longer trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Likeably consistent already but has to raise his game to beat the two form horses here
🔦 Spotlight: Ffos Las bumper winner who then on hurdling debut came up against this week's Huntingdon Listed winner Califet En Vol, who was 15l his superior; probably ran to a similar level when third over Doncaster's extended 2m3f; may have to raise his game to beat the two form horses here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point winner; only 2-1 but ran no race from an early stage on hurdling debut
🔦 Spotlight: Recruited for £58,000 after winning an Irish point and that form has substance; off for 435 days before his hurdling debut at Exeter where he ran no race from an early stage; that was disappointing given his prominence in the market (2-1); now has tongue tied.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Quiet latest effort but his debut run at Leicester was very likeable
🔦 Spotlight: Only 1l off a subsequent dual winner when neither could live with the smart Sixmilebridge at Leicester in December (2m4f, heavy); given the promise of that run, it was a surprisingly modest effort he delivered at Ffos Las (soft); not one to give up on yet by any means.

🔦 Spotlight: Positives to take from all his runs (hooded the last twice); the latest here (2m novice, soft) was run in dense fog but after a prominent ride he emerged from the gloom to finish 2l off a smart prospect; has strong form claims and he's bred for this longer trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Only 1l off a subsequent dual winner when neither could live with the smart Sixmilebridge at Leicester in December (2m4f, heavy); given the promise of that run, it was a surprisingly modest effort he delivered at Ffos Las (soft); not one to give up on yet by any means.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fourth at Warwick confirms he has ability; can win races but perhaps not this one
🔦 Spotlight: From off the pace he was only beaten 13l in a Warwick maiden (2m5f, good to soft) and it was always going to be tough at Cheltenham next time; has races in him but perhaps not this one; the tongue-tie is new.

💬 Comment: Bumped into a smart one here latest; strong form claims and he's bred for this longer trip
🔦 Spotlight: Positives to take from all his runs (hooded the last twice); the latest here (2m novice, soft) was run in dense fog but after a prominent ride he emerged from the gloom to finish 2l off a smart prospect; has strong form claims and he's bred for this longer trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point winner; only 2-1 but ran no race from an early stage on hurdling debut
🔦 Spotlight: Recruited for £58,000 after winning an Irish point and that form has substance; off for 435 days before his hurdling debut at Exeter where he ran no race from an early stage; that was disappointing given his prominence in the market (2-1); now has tongue tied.

🔦 Spotlight: Second foal; dam runner-up in point, out of bumper winning half-sister to 2m-2m6f hurdle/chase winner Inchiquin Castle; in a leading yard so makes sense to check the betting.
