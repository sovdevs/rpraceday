🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Penalised for winning with lots of authority at Cheltenham on Thursday; hard to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Stays 3m but she's not short of pace and travelled much the best en route to comfortably winning a 2m mares' handicap at Cheltenham on Thursday; didn't appear to have a hard race and should be hard to beat under a penalty; good ground seems the key to her.
Horse quote: 2025-04-17 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "I thought Shakeyatailfeather would win at this meeting all the way through the winter but in the two and a half mile race. She wants better ground and being a mares-only card it was always going to suit her. We went to the race we were most likely to win - Dan Skelton, trainer."

💬 Comment: On a hat-trick and this keen-going front-runner should enjoy it around here
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up on his chase debut in February and has since justified favouritism in good-ground handicaps at Taunton (2m) and Stratford (2m3f); up in the weights accordingly but he's a keen-going front-runner who should enjoy it around here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10l winner over C&D on chase debut and following defeat was only four days later
🔦 Spotlight: Won by 10l on C&D chase debut in March and it was only four days later when beaten under a 7lb penalty at Fakenham; has a further 3lb to deal with now in a deeper race but she should be better for a break.
Horse quote: 2024-04-24 at Uttoxeter (16f): "Taxus Baccata pretty much made all in her point-to-point as well and she has a lovely attitude. I did feel like I was tying up in the last furlong but it's tiring ground, I've pressed on a long way out and it was a game performance - Conor O'Farrell, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: The first-time blinkers will need to work again but he wasn't overly pressed to win over a similar trip at Fontwell and that was a Class 2 (on good); respected despite the 7lb rise triggering a career-high mark.
Horse quote: 2025-03-28 at Fontwell (19.5f): "I'm particularly delighted as Joe Cotton has been frustratingly consistent without winning. I was thrilled that the headgear seemed to make a difference. He runs on every single type of ground but I imagine we'll probably stop there, he's earned himself a holiday - Jeremy Scott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Remote fourth at Taunton continued this season's struggles; well treated, though
🔦 Spotlight: Headed to Taunton last time defending an unbeaten record there (2-2) but that remote fourth continued this season's struggles; too well treated to ignore but reservations for now.
Horse quote: 2023-11-16 at Taunton (18f): "Heros had to battle and they went a good gallop. I was pleased the rain came this morning and I hope there's plenty more to come - Venetia Williams, trainer, talking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner but might be on a harsh mark even if he returns to form after wind surgery
🔦 Spotlight: Has won three Class 5 handicaps this season, the latest over C&D in September (good); below that level in his last three races and might be on a harsh mark even if he returns to form after wind surgery.
Horse quote: 2024-09-22 at Plumpton (20f): "Belgarum will probably get another hike for that after going up 10lb for his last win. However, he's only a 6yo and is looking different to how he's ever looked and he's grown in confidence. He's on an upwards curve - Joe Tizzard, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winless this season but on a good mark if the new headgear works
🔦 Spotlight: 2-11 over fences, the wins coming last season over 2m5f and 2m3f; some good runs this campaign without being overly threatening and cheekpieces are replaced by a visor after pulling up last time; on a handy mark if the new headgear works; good ground is fine.
