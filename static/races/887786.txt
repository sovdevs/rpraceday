💬 Comment: Star performer last term, should be sharper than when beaten by Big Interest on return
🔦 Spotlight: Top hunter chaser last season, winning at Aintree and Punchestown after finishing second at Cheltenham for the second year in a row; his tendency to idle resulted in a narrow win in this race 12 months ago when odds-on; never got close enough to challenge Big Interest at Down Royal; should be closer to peak form now.

💬 Comment: Emerged as a new force in this category when beating Its On The Line at Down Royal
🔦 Spotlight: Built on a fair debut run with a commanding success for Sean Doyle in a Castlelands maiden last March; claimed a huge scalp when making almost all to beat Its On The Line (who was ridden from off the pace) at Down Royal; very promising sort but may find Its On The Line too strong this time.

💬 Comment: Star performer last term, should be sharper than when beaten by Big Interest on return
🔦 Spotlight: Top hunter chaser last season, winning at Aintree and Punchestown after finishing second at Cheltenham for the second year in a row; his tendency to idle resulted in a narrow win in this race 12 months ago when odds-on; never got close enough to challenge Big Interest at Down Royal; should be closer to peak form now.

💬 Comment: Star performer last term, should be sharper than when beaten by Big Interest on return
🔦 Spotlight: Top hunter chaser last season, winning at Aintree and Punchestown after finishing second at Cheltenham for the second year in a row; his tendency to idle resulted in a narrow win in this race 12 months ago when odds-on; never got close enough to challenge Big Interest at Down Royal; should be closer to peak form now.
