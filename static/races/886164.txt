🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Left hurdles form behind with win on chase debut; up 6lb but still looks well treated.
🔦 Spotlight: Showed little worthwhile form in three hurdles starts; left that behind when switched to fences at Lingfield recently (2m4f, heavy; first-time tongue-tie), winning with more in hand than the official margin suggested; up 6lb but still looks well treated and is open to more improvement.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hat-trick seeker; looked to have more to come latest; longer trip can help him find it.
🔦 Spotlight: Has kicked on since returning from a break last December, winning here (2m, soft; first-time hood) and at Catterick (1m7f, soft), both when not far off the pace; up 6lb but he looked to have more to come last time and this longer trip could help him find it.

💬 Comment: Hat-trick seeker; looked to have more to come latest; longer trip can help him find it.
🔦 Spotlight: Has kicked on since returning from a break last December, winning here (2m, soft; first-time hood) and at Catterick (1m7f, soft), both when not far off the pace; up 6lb but he looked to have more to come last time and this longer trip could help him find it.

🔦 Spotlight: 14-race maiden under rules; has been placed in a C&D maiden hunter chase (good), as well as being disqualified here after finishing second (heavy) 12 months ago; below par in both a point and a Cartmel hunter chase last spring; could be competitive if ready after a lengthy break.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Left hurdles form behind with win on chase debut; up 6lb but still looks well treated.
🔦 Spotlight: Showed little worthwhile form in three hurdles starts; left that behind when switched to fences at Lingfield recently (2m4f, heavy; first-time tongue-tie), winning with more in hand than the official margin suggested; up 6lb but still looks well treated and is open to more improvement.

🔦 Spotlight: 14-race maiden under rules; has been placed in a C&D maiden hunter chase (good), as well as being disqualified here after finishing second (heavy) 12 months ago; below par in both a point and a Cartmel hunter chase last spring; could be competitive if ready after a lengthy break.

🔦 Spotlight: Has kicked on since returning from a break last December, winning here (2m, soft; first-time hood) and at Catterick (1m7f, soft), both when not far off the pace; up 6lb but he looked to have more to come last time and this longer trip could help him find it.
