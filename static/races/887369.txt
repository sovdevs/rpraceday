💰 Odds: 2.0 🔥🔥
📝 Comment: raced in last, still plenty to do when switched right over 1f out, ran on but never near to challenge (inquiry held into running and riding of gelding which raced in rear throughout before staying on strongly down  home straight from an unpromising position to finish 4th of 7 runners, beaten 2 1/4 lengths; jockey stated his instructions were to jump out, sit in box seat and see how race developed from there; he explained that gelding had missed the kick and he therefore accepted his early position and decided to sit last; he indicated that he thought the pace was decent for first 2f before it steadied up leaving back straight on first circuit leaving him further out of his ground than had been intended; from this point in race and during middle stages jockey acknowledged that he was aware pace was slow but he was reluctant to make a forward move to improve his position for fear of getting trapped wide; in explaining his riding from leaving back straight on final circuit, he stated that he was again hesitant to switch wide, due to concerns he could end up at least 4 wide around outside of runners, so committed to ride for luck down inner in hope of obtaining a clear passage between rivals on rail or to the inside of a rival if runners fanned approaching home bend, which they often do at Wolverhampton, but it failed to materialise on this occasion and he was denied clear running for some distance approaching  2f marker; on straightening for home he managed to switch gelding to outside, mounting his challenge and gelding had stayed on very well through to line; trainer confirmed instructions; however expressed disappointment that even allowing for fact that gelding wasn't quickest into stride, greater effort had not been made by rider to ensure gelding settled more prominently and was ridden to instructions; trainer also indicated that he was dissatisfied with fact that jockey failed to switch wider and improve his position on to the back of favourite for some distance from approaching 3f marker until entering home straight; jockey told stewards he was still very inexperienced riding in staying races and only had approximately 50 career rides to his name)
