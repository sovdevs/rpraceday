🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Did not get run of the race last time; new trip makes some appeal and he's not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5; runner-up on first two starts after a long absence, latterly on handicap debut here (2m, soft) and that form reads well; 11-8 favourite when only fourth of ten at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) three weeks ago but half the hurdles were omitted and he did not get run of the race from off the pace; new trip makes some appeal and he's not discounted.

💬 Comment: Two easy wins at Taunton (2m3f/2m) before put in his place in 2m Listed contest at Exeter
🔦 Spotlight: 4-8 on the Flat in Germany, the last three wins over 1m4f; easy wins at Taunton (2m3f/2m, good to firm/good) on his first two starts over hurdles but he was put firmly in his place in a Listed contest at Exeter (2m, good to soft) six weeks ago; needs major improvement on this handicap hurdle debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very useful on Flat; won the last two of his three hurdle races and has clear potential
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful middle-distance stayer on the Flat for Jim Bolger, best efforts on good or yielding ground; pulled hard on hurdles debut but has since won a maiden at Plumpton (2m4f, soft) and novice at Ayr (2m, heavy; by 9l); helped set the pace for both those wins; this is a much stiffer task but he has clear potential.

💬 Comment: Rallied powerfully to lead on the post in handicap at Hereford (2m4f, good to soft) latest

💬 Comment: Returned to form with runaway Plumpton novice win (2m5f, good; from 1-8 shot) 12 days ago
🔦 Spotlight: Started his rules career with third of 13 at this track (2m, soft) in January; well beaten on next two starts but he returned to form with runaway win in five-runner novice at Plumpton (2m5f, good; from Mullins-trained 1-8 shot) 12 days ago, which makes him of renewed interest.

🔦 Spotlight: Both wins were over the extended 2m2f on good ground at Stratford last summer, latterly on handicap debut; tailed off in August and not seen since; this is a tough assignment in which to resume the improvement that's needed, but drying ground is no bother.
