🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Thrived on AW since October, winning four times; no course form/wide draw the negatives
🔦 Spotlight: In fine form on AW since October, winning four times; the latest came in a small field at Newcastle but a 2lb rise isn't excessive; drawn wide and this is his first visit to Lingfield so there are negatives.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (6f): "As I was angling out the race in front of me came that way so I switched off heels then I got carried a little bit but Pals Battalion won really comfortably - David Nolan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy C&D win in February; 5f too sharp latest; hood removed today; not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways with a cosy C&D success in February; less good next time before finding 5f too sharp at Newcastle four weeks ago; return to this trip a positive and the removal of a hood could help too.
Horse quote: 2022-09-16 at Ayr (5f): "The doubt was there because Prince Of Pillo had run the other day and we were backing him up quite quick. But if he hadn't been bumped at Doncaster he'd have been a comfortable third behind two very good two-year-olds. He's got so much natural pace and he's got a lovely relaxed attitude as well. I'd say he's a good one - Keith Dalgleish, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-09-21 at Ayr (6f): "We'd never put the visor on Silky Wilkie at home but I thought we had to try something different, I had a feeling he was saving something for himself and getting a bit wise. It obviously worked really well - Karl Burke, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair stable debut at Southwell 12 days ago; fine over 6f but others look better treated
🔦 Spotlight: Ran creditably on his stable debut at Southwell 12 days ago and returning to 6f won't be a problem; not sure he's ahead of his mark though.
Horse quote: 2021-02-27 at Lingfield (AW) (5f): "Crimson Sand had a few niggly problems last year but this year he's been flawless and that was a good start. He was working well enough to go and win that so I'm delighted. We'll see what he gets but he'll be better over six than five - Richard Hughes, trainer."

Horse quote: 2021-03-13 at Wolverhampton (AW) (7f): "It's nice for the owners as Mums Tipple looked a serious horse at two but last year was a bit of a mess for many reasons. He ran a fine race at Lingfield and the step up to seven furlongs suited him. There were some good horses in there but the race went well for him and he did it nicely. He's a fast horse, started well and the race went smoothly - Ryan Moore, jockey.  Mums Tipple worked very well during the week and it's nice to see him back after his encouraging run at Lingfield. He's a very good horse and it's been a little bit unfair as he gets knocked every time he runs. People want to see a similar performance to what he did at York each time but that was one of the best performances I've seen by any horse - even I was shocked by that - and people haven't given him a break since that. He's got an awful lot of ability so it's nice to see him win, and win very well, at that level. Hopefully he can build on that for the rest of the year and we'll probably go for the Mile on Finals' Day - Richard Hannon, trainer."
