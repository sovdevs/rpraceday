💬 Comment: Still an entire; 🔍 unexposed 5yo whose only defeat came in a good novice at Newmarket
🔦 Spotlight: Still an entire; 🔍 unexposed 5yo whose only defeat came in a good novice at Newmarket and he comfortably accounted for three rivals on the step up to 1m4f at Wolverhampton in May 2023; has been absent for nearly two years but market confidence ahead of this handicap debut would heighten interest.
Horse quote: 2023-05-15 at Wolverhampton (AW) (12f): "We were hoping for better last time out so thankfully we got a better performance today. I don't think the step up in trip made the difference. Fortunately, nothing wanted to beat Majestic Warrior today so we had to make our own running and it wasn't a truly-run mile and a half - he just produced a better performance - James Tate, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-08-13 at Newbury (12f): "We thought as a youngster Saratoga Gold wanted softer ground, being by Mayson, but he seems to like it quick and Kayleigh gave him a cool ride. We had another in here but she said she wanted to ride him so credit to her - Charles Hills, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lacks a recent run and always needs a strong pace to chase
🔦 Spotlight: Has slipped to a dangerous mark and has run the odd decent race in defeat for his current yard; however, lacks a recent run and always needs a strong pace to chase.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Former Listed winner but hasn't threatened in six races for Tim Easterby
🔦 Spotlight: Former Listed winner for Andrew Balding but those days are long gone and hasn't threatened in six races for Tim Easterby; best watched on this reappearance.
Horse quote: 2021-08-14 at Newbury (7f): "Masekela has a couple of entries in the Champagne Stakes and the Royal Lodge and I need to talk to Andrew, but my view is that a mile is the right distance. William said he's a nice horse and there would be more to come. He said he'd make a nice 3yo, which we always felt as he's a big horse - Mick Mariscotti, owner."
