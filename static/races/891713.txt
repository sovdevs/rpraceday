🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two from two at Perth but this looks a difficult task; first go at 3m under rules
🔦 Spotlight: Defied top weight in Class 4 handicap at Market Rasen last time, taking chase record to 3-6; she's 2-2 at Perth but this looks a difficult task; first run beyond 2m5f under rules.
