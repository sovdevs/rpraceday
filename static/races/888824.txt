🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's winner all the better for two recent Grade 1 runs as he builds towards Aintree
🔦 Spotlight: Brilliant winner of last season's Grand National continues his preparation for a repeat bid by attempting to emulate last year's win in this race (only four runners); two recent runs in Grade 1s behind stablemate Galopin Des Champs should have him straighter; Townend's pick but this looks a tougher task than last year.
