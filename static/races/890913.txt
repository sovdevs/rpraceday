🔦 Spotlight: Down the field at Southwell three weeks ago, but has done well over C&D, winning back-to-back races during the winter, at the main expense of two of these rivals; beat Sacred Oath by one length in a maiden and gave Annaghmccanns 10lb and a 1 1/4l beating in a handicap.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close here in December, plenty to find with Trishuli River on running five weeks ago.
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win came over C&D in November 2023; best run for some time (well-backed) when back to same mark in similar contest in December when beaten a short head, finishing strongly; failed to reproduce that form five weeks ago; plenty to find with Trishuli River on that running.
