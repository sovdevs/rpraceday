🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The sole Grade 1 winner in this field; ran well in the Arkle most recently; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Acts on any ground; useful handicap hurdler and an even better novice chaser, producing form figures of 11114 in this sphere; the only Grade 1 winner in this field, having beaten Touch Me Not in the Henry VIII at Sandown (1m7f, soft) in December, and most recently ran well in a thrilling Arkle where he wilted towards the finish having hit the front a tad sooner than Harry Skelton had planned (left in lead two out); 🎖️ major contender, provided he takes well to first-time cheekpieces.

💬 Comment: Form figures of 111311 in completed starts at about 2m; interesting back down in distance
🔦 Spotlight: Seems versatile as regards ground; non-stayer over a testing 2m4f in the Scilly Isles at Sandown last time; has form figures of 111311 in completed starts at about 2m, the third-place finish in Grade 1 juvenile hurdle at this meeting last year; has proved ahead of his mark in two novice handicap chase wins, markedly so at Cheltenham on second occasion; interesting back down in trip, with a resumption of progress plausible.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form figures of 111311 in completed starts at about 2m; interesting back down in distance
🔦 Spotlight: Seems versatile as regards ground; non-stayer over a testing 2m4f in the Scilly Isles at Sandown last time; has form figures of 111311 in completed starts at about 2m, the third-place finish in Grade 1 juvenile hurdle at this meeting last year; has proved ahead of his mark in two novice handicap chase wins, markedly so at Cheltenham on second occasion; interesting back down in trip, with a resumption of progress plausible.
