🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close in sole 2yo run and he's a key player on comeback for 🆕 new yard; hood added
🔦 Spotlight: 50-1 for Bath debut (5.7f, good to firm) last June, but he made a bold bid before finishing a close second behind a subsequent triple Listed winner; left Sylvester Kirk since and has been ✂️ gelded; hood is now added on his comeback, but he has leading claims on his debut form and is a key player for 🆕 new yard.

💬 Comment: Went close on recent Chelmsford debut and she should improve for that experience
🔦 Spotlight: First foal of a 6f/7f winner (including AW; RPR 93); well backed into 2-1 at Chelmsford (6f, AW) 11 days ago and she came from off the pace to finish a close second behind the favourite; that was a promising start and she should improve for the experience.

🔦 Spotlight: Made an encouraging debut when fifth at Ripon (6f, good) last month and he built on that with a front-running third behind a 1-3 shot at Ayr (6f, good to firm); that latest form puts him firmly in the picture and he's respected on this switch to AW.

🔦 Spotlight: Out of a well-related 6f winner and he cost 80,000euros (breeze-up) as a 2yo; finished third of five when favourite at Hamilton (5f, good to firm) 15 days ago, but he looked inexperienced and was only beaten around 2l; should know more this time and he's a likely 🚀 improver upped in trip.
