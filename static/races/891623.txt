🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Major player on form but isn't crying out for this step back up to 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Has justified favouritism in two Meydan events this year, taking 6f record to 3-4; Listed runner-up over 7f last term; major player on the figures but isn't necessarily crying out for the return to this trip.
Horse quote: 2025-01-10 at Meydan (6f): "Symbol Of Honour had to dig really deep. I think he probably needed the race after a bit of a layoff but I really liked that when he got headed he battled back gamely. The five and six furlong races here, when they meet the intersection and the straight course, the race really starts and we just got caught a little flat-footed there. I think he's more a horse for six-seven furlongs, he's not a horse to drop down in distance - William Buick, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Produced form figures of 1122 in a solid 2yo campaign; in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Produced form figures of 1122 in a solid 2yo campaign, the second-place finishes in Group 3 over C&D and 6f Listed contest at Doncaster, both on soft ground; in the mix, assuming his consistency is sustained.
Horse quote: 2024-09-06 at Ascot (6f): "Diego Ventura shouldn't really have won given the way things unfolded. He had to make up a lot of ground and I had to switch him out to the middle of the track to get a clear run. We then got a bit of a bump from the second, but the fact he has won giving weight away has to be positive - James Doyle, jockey."

💬 Comment: Possibilities, provided the form of his 25-1 win over C&D is backed up
🔦 Spotlight: Belied his 25-1 odds and apparent difficult task at the weights in useful conditions race over C&D (good) on seasonal debut, taking record to 3-7; possibilities, provided that performance is backed up.
Horse quote: 2025-04-17 at Newmarket (7f): "Pellitory is a massive horse who has done all his work with Wimbledon Hawkeye [stable companion]. We've had this race planned the whole season and you get here and think it's a strong race but it was a learning curve today to see whether we were a handicapper or a bit better. He's got a French Guineas entry and we'll think about it but he's a lovely horse with a great future - James Owen, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Group 3 winner over C&D last autumn but has to overcome a 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Came up well short in a strong Craven Stakes here on seasonal debut; bagged Group 3 honours over C&D last autumn but has to overcome a 5lb penalty and the threat from less-exposed types.
Horse quote: 2024-09-26 at Newmarket (7f): "Oisin Murphy just got off and said, 'Is he in the Dewhurst?'. But I expect I've made the most terrible balls [up] of it. The Waco Kid did have an entry but I think after he was only third at Listed level I took him out of the Dewhurst and the Lagardere. There's the Criterium International, so we might go there as he handles soft ground but we'll see. The Breeders' Cup is also an option as well. What's so lovely about this horse is that with every run he's got better - Hugo Palmer, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive in a couple of 7f novice events and looks highly promising
🔦 Spotlight: Two from two, having recorded impressive wins in 7f novice events at Sandown (good) and Kempton (AW); was a possible 2,000 Guineas candidate but goes for this easier option instead, en route to bigger assignments; highly promising.
Horse quote: 2025-04-09 at Kempton (AW) (7f): "It was as good as we could have hoped for. They went slow and Cosmic Year has such a good temperament to take it all in his stride. We'll have to speak to the Juddmonte team about plans as they have a lot of other horses, like Jonquil and Field Of Gold. There's a few horses in the mix so we'll let the dust settle. I would be a little wary ? as I was with Newbury this weekend ? of running him on quick ground. The weather will change at some point but if it stays dry through the month it feels like it could be a bit of a tough ask. The French and Irish Guineas are other options, as well as different routes into Royal Ascot, but we'll see what the team want to do. It's massively important to have these kind of horses in the yard and to be able to deliver for a proper operation like Juddmonte is essential - Harry Charlton, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."
