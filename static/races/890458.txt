💬 Comment: Ran a promising race at Kempton before struggling in a Listed race; tongue-tie added
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in one French run over 1m4f (very soft); made a positive stable/hurdle debut at Kempton before failing to fire in a Listed race at Musselburgh (again good to soft) when tried in cheekpieces; should be capable of better again and a tongue-tie is added.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed over 8.6f on the Flat but modest form, which has also been the case in his two runs over hurdles; no significance in the removal of headgear but he has had a wind operation.
