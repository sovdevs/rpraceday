💬 Comment: Decent maiden form, solid h'cap run over 1m2f last month, dam handled heavy, chance
🔦 Spotlight: Decent level of form in first three maidens on good-good to yielding; outclassed in a listed at Tipperary and beaten 3.75l off 80 on seasonal reappearance in a handicap at Leopardstown (1m2f, good); sets the standard back in maiden company and her dam handled heavy; claims.
