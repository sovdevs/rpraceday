🔦 Spotlight: 4-13 over hurdles, the latest win at Warwick (2m5f, good to soft) in November; this half-sister to smart chaser Ballybolley could be a nice prospect for fences but she's thrown in at the deep end for her chase debut, and also has to bounce back from a below-par run over hurdles three weeks ago.
