💬 Comment: Two solid runs in beginners chases; 🔥 big player if handling this quicker ground
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m Fairyhouse maiden hurdle last season and but failed to feature in better company; encouraging chase debut third behind a smart mare at Tipperary in November and better again when runner-up (winner has won again since) in Fairyhouse beginners latest; 🔥 big player if handling this quicker ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needs to jump better than she has so far but 🔥 big player if doing so
🔦 Spotlight: Made all in 2m Fairyhouse 4yo hurdle last season (soft) and found wanting in Graded company, though ran well in Boodles at Cheltenham and when third in Grade 2 at Fairyhouse; far from fluent in two attempts chasing, latest after lengthy absence at Fairyhouse last month when fair fourth in good-class mares' beginners; this looks a weaker race so 🔥 big player, especially given a more fluent round of jumping.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy sort, a danger to all if getting her jumping sorted and better ground should suit
🔦 Spotlight: 99-rated performer on the Flat; Killarney maiden hurdle winner but jumping has let her down on both attempts chasing; classy sort, a danger to all if getting her jumping sorted and this looks a weaker race; better ground to suit too.
