🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Brilliant novice hurdle winner here last year; 2-3 in chases; should stay; the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Brilliant winner of the Turners Novices' Hurdle at this meeting last year; 2-3 over fences, losing to only Sir Gino, but jumping has been sketchy at times and it took until after the last for him to assert in the Ladbrokes Novice Chase at Leopardstown (extended 2m5f, yielding) last month; that, plus his stout pedigree, gives hope he will stay and he looks the one to beat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won 3 Grade 1s over hurdles and stayed on strongly last time; would relish a thorough test
🔦 Spotlight: Won three Grade 1 novice hurdles last season, including on good to yielding ground at Punchestown, and third in the Albert Bartlett here; jumped well and stayed on stoutly when winning his more recent start over fences in Grade 3 at Naas (3m1f, heavy) in January; likely to prove Ballyburn's main challenge, but the stiffer the test the better for him and spring ground may not help.

🔦 Spotlight: Won the Martin Pipe at this meeting in 2024 then third to Dancing City in 3m Grade 1 at Punchestown; 2-3 over fences, not having to improve when holding on in Grade 2 at Navan last time (3m, soft to heavy) but he did jump notably well; may have to settle for minor honours again at this level.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made hay in autumn; close 4th in Grade 1 when last seen; spring conditions in his favour
🔦 Spotlight: Made hay in the autumn over fences, winning twice including a Grade 3 at Cork (2m4f, good) in November; close fourth in Grade 1 at Fairyhouse (2m4f, yielding) when last seen in early December and likely to come up short here unless spring ground stumps his rivals.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Closing on Better Days Ahead to the line last time; may want a stiffer test
🔦 Spotlight: Last-gasp win in last year's Albert Bartlett here (3m, heavy) was the highlight of his hurdles career; took three runs to match that level over fences, closing to the line on Better Days Ahead at Navan (3m, soft to heavy) 31 days ago; it's likely he would appreciate a stiffer test than spring ground is likely to provide.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Much improved over fences when winning 2m3f Grade 3 last time; needs to back that up
🔦 Spotlight: Just shy of the best novice hurdlers last season but 2-2 front-running over fences, much improved in Grade 3 at Punchestown (extended 2m3f, soft) last time despite dicey jumping; could play the hare again but it's hard to see him staying away.
