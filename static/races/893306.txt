🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten 9l on return in a Leopardstown Group 3; can improve from that effort though
🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for yard; won a 1m Curragh maiden on debut last November on yld-sft but was beaten 9l on return in a Leopardstown Group 3 over 1m2f; can improve from that effort though and will be fine if the ground eases.
Horse quote: 2024-11-03 at Curragh (8f): "Kibris is a gorgeous big horse. The race set up lovely for him, he travelled well and was very professional. He picked up better than I thought. He has plenty about him and is one to look forward to - Dylan Browne McMonagle, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rated 99 and the forecast rain is in his favour so is a 🔥 big player; tongue-tie on
🔦 Spotlight: One of two runners for yard; got off the mark on third start last term when winning a 1m1f Tipperary maiden on soft; even better effort when beaten 5.5l in a Leopardstown Group 3 next time; rated 99 and the forecast rain is in his favour so is a 🔥 big player; tongue-tie on.
Horse quote: 2024-10-06 at Tipperary (9f): "Emit is a grand horse. He didn't get the message to go past but when he did he was snug at the line. He's a lovely staying colt - Declan McDonogh, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Third in a Curragh maiden on debut last year and later won a Dundalk maiden over 1m; improved effort after a 3 month break when winning a 1m2f rated race at the same track; has to prove her effectiveness on the forecast easy ground but can go well if handling it.
