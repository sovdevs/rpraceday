🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good 2m3f maiden win in October; staying-on third in second handicap (2m4f); has potential
🔦 Spotlight: Good effort to beat a subsequent winner in 2m3f maiden at Fontwell in October but was never competitive on handicap debut at Taunton after; had to work to take a late third at Windsor (2m4f, soft) last month and the extra furlong looks sure to suit; should have potential at this level.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running well when taking heavy fall latest; needs to show confidence is unaffected
🔦 Spotlight: Won point and bumper in 2023; maiden over hurdles but she's run well in two of her four handicaps and had only just given best when falling heavily (2m4f, soft; lay winded) at the last at Ffos Las in January; form chance but needs to show that experience hasn't left its mark.

💬 Comment: Latest win over fences in 2022 but lightly raced since and creditable show over C&D latest
🔦 Spotlight: Losing run goes back to a chase win in 2022 but he's lightly raced for his age and he showed up well in a female amateur jockeys' race over C&D (good to soft) in December, on second run back from a layoff and for 🆕 new yard; might still have needed that run; can go well.

🔦 Spotlight: Latest hurdle win was in 2022 but she won and ran well over fences in the early months of 2024; below best over hurdles this winter but her mark continues to slide so can't ignore.

💬 Comment: Minor hurdle win before modest chase runs; no impact back hurdling; could fare better here
🔦 Spotlight: Made short work of rivals in ordinary Hereford novice (2m, good) in November; failed to flourish over fences on next two starts and was never sighted back hurdling at Southwell (11l behind Whatsupwithyou); work to do on that effort but no surprise to see him fare better here.
