🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual-purpose; won two at Cork last year at 1m4f, 3lb above last win, ground fine, claims
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; 2-6 on turf on the Flat, both wins coming over 1m4f under this rider at Cork off 50 (soft) and off 64 (good) last season; pleasing return to the level at Ballinrobe (1m5f, good) ten days ago after a spell over timber; just 3lb above last win now and trip and ground fine; chance.
Horse quote: 2024-04-26 at Cork (12f): "Solar Drive did it well and jumps hurdles as well. There's a 1m4f handicap at the Galway festival so hopefully he can get into that - Paul Flynn, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Blood at nostril and pulled up when last seen over timber, may need this on Flat h'cap bow
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; won a handicap hurdle at Punchestown in January but pulled up and had blood at his nostril when last seen in that sphere at Naas in February; off since and now makes Flat handicap debut; ran well at this trip in a maiden at Galway last summer but may need this run.
Horse quote: 2025-01-13 at Punchestown (16.5f): "Ragmans Corner is a grand little horse and is only learning to race now. We will mix it with the Flat if we can and I will probably give him a shot at Dundalk - Gerry Keane, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won back to back races last October, off 64 at the Curragh (1m2f, yielding) and then off 71 at Galway (1m4f, heavy); may have needed her moderate comeback effort but she probably wants softer ground than she'll encounter here.
Horse quote: 2024-10-22 at Curragh (10f): "Nans View has been knocking on the door and finished strongly the last day over a mile. Dylan said she hit the line well today and she'll probably go a little bit further - Jarlath Fahey, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner over 10.5f last season, 6lb lower, drawn to attack, could make a bold bid
🔦 Spotlight: Seven-time winner, including three at 1m4f on good ground; course winner over 10.5f (good) off 68 last July under customary positive ride; 6lb lower now and may have needed his last couple of runs on ground softer than ideal; drawn to attack and could make a bold bid.
Horse quote: 2023-09-13 at Tramore (12f): "Out On Friday was stepping back in trip, which suited him as all he does is stay. He loves to get his own way in front and can go on any ground - Sean Bowen, jockey, speaking on Racing TV"

💬 Comment: Won off 5lb lower last April, ran well here over 10.5f, acts on good ground, place chance
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; won over 1m at Gowran last April on yielding off 73 and went close in a conditions race over 10.5f here on soft the following month; got an 8lb for that and still remains 5lb above his last win; unraced at this trip but should stay and acts on good ground; place chance.
