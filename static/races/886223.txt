🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has run well over 1m7f/2m the last twice and this step back up in trip could be a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Stayed on well to win at Hexham (1m7f, soft) in December on second chase start and bumped into a much-improved winner when second at Ayr (2m, soft) last time; shapes as though this step back up in trip will be a plus and this 🔍 unexposed 6yo is high on the list.

💬 Comment: 📈 progressive 6yo who is 2-3 over fences and could take latest 7lb rise in his stride
🔦 Spotlight: Won in first-time cheekpieces (retained since) on his handicap and chase debut at Leicester (2m6f, soft) in December, and bounced back from lesser run on good ground at Catterick to win by 6l at Sedgefield (3m2f, soft) three weeks ago; drops back in trip today but at a stiff track and this 📈 progressive 6yo could take his latest 7lb rise in his stride.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up last time but 3 wins last term; shouldn't be written off after just one poor run
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up at Haydock in December and hard to be confident after that; however, he won three times last term (including here) and didn't run badly on his reappearance in November; shouldn't be written off after just one poor run.
