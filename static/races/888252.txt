🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point form reads well and he showed his true colours in winning easily at Newcastle
🔦 Spotlight: Close second to this season's Grade 1 Challow runner-up Wendigo in an Irish point; first two runs under rules were not great but he took a huge step forward to win comfortably at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft); now looks a good prospect.

💬 Comment: Ran no race when odds-on last time but he's a lot better than that and won three times
🔦 Spotlight: Posted a useful RPR in winning the bumper on this card 12 months ago (heavy) and impressed on his hurdling debut at Naas (2m3f, good to yielding); went off odds-on to follow up at Carlisle but ran no race; he's a lot better than he showed that day.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Others in here have superior form but they are penalised; could go well
🔦 Spotlight: Returning from a year out when fifth at Doncaster (2m3f) and then ran well upped to 3m at Ludlow (good to soft); others in here have superior form but they are penalised; could go well.
