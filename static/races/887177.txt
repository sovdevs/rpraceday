🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rallying fourth on recent chase debut and that was after a long absence
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who was initially disappointing under rules for Michael Scudamore but ran a lot better after his absence on chase debut at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft), rallying for a close fourth; entitled to build on that.

🔦 Spotlight: Third in a Market Rasen handicap hurdle last summer (2m7f, good) and held every chance on his chase debut next time when sprawling on the landing side of two out at Sedgefield (2m5f, good to soft); granted time to get over that unfortunate mishap and he's 2lb lower for this return to action.
