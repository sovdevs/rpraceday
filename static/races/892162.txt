🔦 Spotlight: 1-8 on turf and rated 108; sole win came in a 7f Curragh Group 2 in August 2023 and finished a 1.25l second in the Moyglare subsequently; best run last year a 0.5l third on her seasonal return in the French 1,000 Guineas (1m, soft); down in class here but she hasn't run over this distance since her debut; obvious chance on paper but the trip raises questions.
