🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: He's been much better than this level in his day and an intriguing runner on stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Has some high-class sprint form down the years, including over C&D; has left David O'Meara since last seen; has an absence to overcome but the booking of Billy Loughnane (four wins and four seconds from 15 rides for the yard) is a strong hint he's ready to go.
