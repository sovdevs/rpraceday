🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Punchestown display caught the attention of the stewards, could be hard to beat now
🔦 Spotlight: Attracted the attention of the stewards when staying on for fourth in a stronger maiden than this at Punchestown six weeks ago; jockey said the Westerner gelding has temperamental issues (misbehaved at the start on debut); can win a maiden of this standard.

🔦 Spotlight: Positives to take from all three bumper runs in respectable company; travelled well to the straight when favourite on his hurdling debut in a 2m3f maiden at Limerick, began to weaken after a mistake two out and dropped away after another error at the last; down in trip with a leading chance providing he jumps better.
