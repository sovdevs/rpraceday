💬 Comment: Back in the groove with creditable second in C&D series final last month; good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from layoff with two quiet runs this year but got back in the groove with creditable second of 16 behind Starlyte in competitive series final over C&D (good to soft) last month; also suited by good ground; must be considered.
Horse quote: 2023-10-03 at Sedgefield (20f): "It (the win) was too late for my liking! It was a learning curve and Imperial Data was getting into the bottom of them a bit when jumping. The track rode beautifully - Ross Chapman, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Made all to score by 6l at Newcastle (2m4f, good) three weeks ago and is now 6-20 over hurdles; also suited by this C&D and probably still on a workable mark after recent 5lb rise; likely contender.
Horse quote: 2023-11-05 at Carlisle (20f): "I only have two horses so how could I be confident but Fingal's Hill is a good trier - we'll get to the bottom of him eventually but he keeps trying - Peter Atkinson, trainer."

💬 Comment: Resurgent mare who won a competitive series final over C&D last month; in the mix again
🔦 Spotlight: Resurgent mare who arguably posted career-best performance when coming from off the pace in competitive series final over C&D (good to soft) last month, beating Imperial Data by over 4l; 7lb higher today but the faster ground will also suit; ought to be right in the thick of things again.
Horse quote: 2025-03-22 at Kelso (21f): "I love racing because of the horses and Starlyte is the sort of horse I love. She's only tiny but she's so brave. You have to drop her in and let her pass horses and I'm delighted for the owners Allan and Anne Grant who've just got married - Lucinda Russell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Lightly raced 10yo; rallied for narrow win in December; may still have potential
🔦 Spotlight: Dual bumper winner; very lightly raced since launching hurdling career with two promising runs in autumn 2021 but rallied well for narrow win in five-runner Doncaster handicap (2m3f, good to soft) in December and may still have a bigger run him.
Horse quote: 2024-12-13 at Doncaster (19.5f): "Sauce Of Life has had his issues over the years but his owners have given him plenty of time and now they're starting to get the rewards. He just took his time to get into top gear but, once he did, he was away and gone - Danny McMenamin, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On the downgrade now and was just a respectable fifth in first-time cheekpieces last month
🔦 Spotlight: Good servant to connections over the years (six hurdle wins); on the downgrade now, though, and was just a respectable fifth in first-time cheekpieces (retained) at regular haunt Wetherby (2m5f, good) last month.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returned from layoff with encouraging run in February but well beaten since
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 9yo with 1-7 strike-rate over hurdles; returned from layoff with very encouraging sixth of 17 at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in February but month's run there (2m5f, good) was very disappointing and it's hard to know what to expect from him here.
