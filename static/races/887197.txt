🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back in prime form in first-time cheekpieces at Wincanton recently, winning by 16l
🔦 Spotlight: Back in prime form in first-time cheekpieces at Wincanton (2m4f, soft) 12 days ago, winning easily by 16l; subsequent 8lb rise might have been worse and he'll be a tough nut to crack if the headgear continues to have a positive effect.

🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably exploited excellent opportunity in uncompetitive, three-runner novice chase at Exeter (2m3f, good) in November but looked very unenthusiastic before eventually keeping on for modest third in Wincanton handicap (2m4f, good to soft) the following month; needs to race with much more zest in first-time blinkers here.
