🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Just held on at Lingfield latest (1m), but this longer trip presents no issue on pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: Smarter horse from the outset when landing the odds at Lingfield in December (1m), only just holding on but in fairness having committed a good way out; no shortage of encouragement on pedigree for tonight's longer trip, and this wouldn't be any stronger a race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Better when fifth at Lingfield, if not helping the rider fully; hood back on stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Improvement when fifth on the second of two 1m Polytrack runs for Andrew Balding last autumn, if slowly away again and hanging late; have to hope the returning hood enables her to help herself and the rider more.

🔦 Spotlight: Niece of Pether's Moon (Coronation Cup) who shaped on December's Chelmsford 7f fifth as in need of at least tonight's sort of trip now; uplift likely, though prospects perhaps still brighter in handicaps after.

🔦 Spotlight: Never able to break out of midfield when a 33-1 seventh on December's Chelmsford debut (1m); retains potential at 6f-1m on breeding and too early to write off, but does need to work out what's required more.
