💬 Comment: On a hat-trick; up another 10lb here but goes well fresh and could have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced for his age; ready winner over 2m4f here in November and followed up over 2m3f at Punchestown; up another 10lb here but goes well fresh and could have more to offer.
Horse quote: 2024-12-31 at Punchestown (19f): "Farmers Lodge is a quality horse. His chase form was good and he had a good mark over hurdles. He will mix and match between the two. I think there might be a good handicap chase in him somewhere - Barry Connell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't happen for him at Cheltenham when only 8-1 for Pertemps Final; four wins previously
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't happen for him at Cheltenham when only 8-1 for Pertemps Final but had won four of his previous seven starts over hurdles including Pertemps qualifier at Leopardstown over Christmas; 10lb higher mark than for that success; has done his winning on good to yielding ground.
Horse quote: 2024-10-24 at Clonmel (19.5f): "The ground went against Win Some Lose Some the last day at Listowel, he hated it. These were ideal conditions. We went no gallop and it turned into a sprint. He takes time to warm into it, but he sparked up going down to the second-last. He's a good-ground horse - Mark Walsh, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden winner over 2m; poor run on heavy when tried in a tongue-tie over 2m3f last time
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to last month's Gold Cup winner won 2m Punchestown maiden on decent ground last May; lame when pulled up in Grade 3 at Navan; poor run on heavy when tried in a tongue-tie in 2m3f rated novice back at Punchestown in January; bit to prove but still early days.
Horse quote: 2024-05-21 at Punchestown (16f): "Mywayofthinkin is a big horse and we were glad to see the rain this morning. He was professional over the last two when it was needed. He'll be going out to grass shortly - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won handicap over this trip at Cheltenham (good to soft) in November; two poor runs since
🔦 Spotlight: Useful stayer on the Flat and won handicap over this trip at Cheltenham (good to soft) in November; two poor runs since, over 3m at Musselburgh and when hampered early and never involved over 2m at Aintree earlier this month.
Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Cheltenham (21f): "All I wanted was for Hamsiyann to come back safe, it didn't matter whether he won or not. I was hoping he would avoid bad luck and have a bit of luck on his side. He was lucky that the horse who fell three out didn't bring him down. I gave a good bit of money for him a couple of years ago, but he's only coming to his milk now. That was sweet - Tony Martin, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-02-05 at Punchestown (23.5f): "Lucky Lyreen stays strong, idled in front but when something came to him he went on again. He lets you down a small bit with his jumping but I think he just loses concentration a little bit at a hurdle - Jack Kennedy, rider."

💬 Comment: Good second in 3m handicap hurdle at Cheltenham (soft) on New Year's Day; well held since
🔦 Spotlight: Welsh raider won 3m contests over fences and hurdles on good to soft ground in November and good second in 3m handicap hurdle at Cheltenham (soft) on New Year's Day; well held both starts since, including in Newbury chase last time.
Horse quote: 2024-11-29 at Doncaster (24.5f): "We ran Idefix De Ciergues back over hurdles as he was just a bit sticky over fences so we just thought it'd be a confidence boost and it seems to have done the trick. We'll probably go back over fences next time - Rebecca Curtis, trainer."

💬 Comment: Been a struggle for him since Listowel victory and well held over 2m4f/2m7f last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Useful 4yo form last year, second in Fred Winter and winner of the Lartigue at Listowel; been a struggle for him since that latest victory and well held over 2m4f/2m7f last twice.
Horse quote: 2024-09-26 at Listowel (16f): "The plan has been to come back for this race and we gave Eagles Reign a prep run on the Flat three weeks ago to open the pipes. It was in the lap of the gods whether he would get his ground or not, as he grows a leg on soft ground. When the rain started yesterday it didn't stop ? you couldn't write it better. He ran such a great race at Cheltenham and was a bit flat at Aintree. Tommy [Ward, owner) suggested the Lartigue, and it made sense - Ross O'Sullivan, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-10-02 at Fairyhouse (16f): "I've always liked Redstone and he's going to be a very nice horse in time ? he's big too.
