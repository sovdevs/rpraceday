💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way when third here (2m4f, heavy) last month, his second handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up on last month's handicap debut but ran well for a long way before fading into third here (2m4f, heavy) three weeks ago and has possibilities if this less taxing trip-and-ground combination suits.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returned from long layoff with encouraging run in January but well beaten since
🔦 Spotlight: Well handicapped on old form and returned from long absence with quite encouraging 2m4f run in January but Newbury last  month was disappointing and it's hard to know what to expect from him on this drop back in trip; seems versatile regarding ground, though.

🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles at seventh attempt, with clearcut win under Conor Ring at Plumpton (2m, soft) in January; subsequent 5lb rise does not look excessive and he may not have been suited by the return to 2m4f when slightly below form last time; contender if he handles this faster ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has struggled on all three starts for race-sponsor Alison Thorpe this term; revival needed
🔦 Spotlight: Very well handicapped on old form for Nicky Henderson but looked badly out of sorts in Ireland in 2023 and has also struggled on all three starts for race-sponsor Alison Thorpe this season (2m4f-3m); drops back in trip today; revival needed.
