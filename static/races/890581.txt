🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The season started well but his form has cooled and now has to stage a revival
🔦 Spotlight: Reduced mark appeals on his placed efforts earlier this season but he needs to stage a revival after three fairly heavy defeats, latterly in the Topham at Aintree; cheekpieces return but the significance of that is questionable.
Horse quote: 2022-11-19 at Haydock (25.5f): "I'm delighted with Eldorado Allen. It's like a winner as he's run an absolute blinder. He's turned into a proper stayer. It was a great performance by the winner but we're proud as punch with our horse. He's got a King George entry and we'll see how he comes out of it, so we might take our chance in that - Joe Tizzard, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Ended a losing sequence off a reduced mark in a qualifier for this at Warwick (2m4f, soft) and subsequent defeats have come against younger rivals, latterly in a big handicap on Aintree's Grand National card; should have a part to play.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Warwick (20f): "This track really suited him and the fences in quick succession down the back straight meant Le Milos could fill up. He's such a nice horse so it's great to see him back winning - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Could be well-in with Numitor; tough task last time and could feature back from a break
🔦 Spotlight: His bid for a four-timer over fences came unstuck when Numitor beat him at Wincanton but the margin was only a little over 2l and he has a 10lb pull on the winner; a Grade 2 last time was always going to be tough; absent since November but trainer gets them fit at home; respected.
Horse quote: 2024-09-20 at Newton Abbot (21f): "It was a really good performance and Glynn's gone from strength to strength in the last couple of months. He's lightly raced for his age and looks to be improving. He appears to have appreciated a change in scenery, which can happen, and we've had a clear run with him in the last year. He's a very good jumper and we could potentially pitch him in a bit deeper if the ground stays on the quick side in the next month - Dan Downie, racing manager to the Owners Group."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner before a second over 3m at Carlisle; better at this trip and in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Second to Numitor in this 12 months ago; consistent 11yo who was going away at the finish over C&D two runs back and probably better at this trip than the 3m over which he finished second at Carlisle; remains on a competitive mark and very much in the mix.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Haydock (20f): "Dubai Days usually takes a couple of runs to show his best so to do that first time out is good. He had a little niggle in the autumn so we thought we'd get him as ready as we could at home because he can be very hard on himself. He'll be back here next month for the final now - Bruce Lynn, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this last year; career-high mark after 5lb rise for Ascot but he did win well
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Dubai Days in this a year ago; 13lb higher for this defence but he's won three of his last four and beat a few of these in the process; back up to a career-high mark after his 5lb rise for Ascot last time but he did win well.
Horse quote: 2024-12-13 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "That is amazing. I mean, we weren't sure Numitor would handle the track, because he didn't handle Sandown, but you've just got to take your chance, haven't you? That wasn't his ground, he didn't jump as well out of it, but he still won - Heather Main, trainer."

💬 Comment: Up 9lb for winning so well at Newcastle last time but he's on top of his game again
🔦 Spotlight: Has rolled back the years to win three of his last four races and he fairly bombed clear last time at Newcastle (2m4f, good); has more on his plate here off 9lb higher but he'll love the ground and is bang in form.
Horse quote: 2025-04-05 at Newcastle (20f): "Flic Ou Voyou is dependent on good ground, that's why we gave him a layoff. I'm glad that he's done it as well as he did, apart from when I look at what the handicapper does with him! - Henry Hogarth, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten about 10l behind Dubai Days here last time and he's off an untouched mark
🔦 Spotlight: This 10yo has had a fruitful campaign but the handicapper has had his say and there were no real excuses when about 10l behind Dubai Days over C&D two months ago; could be vulnerable again off an untouched mark.
Horse quote: 2025-01-17 at Market Rasen (21.5f): "The Flier Begley is a dream to ride, he travels and jumps like a buck. He won quite well in the end. He ran well last time at Haydock and before that he just didn't get home as he was too keen. He's in form now and seems to be showing it. I thought we were up against it with some of the horses here, but we were coming into it with a horse in form. He likes top of the ground and he stays well - Jack Hogan, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Well held in two hurdles after a long absence but returned to fences at Exeter (2m3f, good) and was all out to repel Spyglass Hill in a four-runner race; up only 2lb and he's historically well handicapped.
Horse quote: 2025-03-18 at Exeter (19f): "It was nice to see The Widdow Maker back, he'd been off the track for two years. These races are made for him as I'm not sure he'd win a normal handicap chase. We'll have a look at the veterans [middle distance] final for him at Haydock next. We could think about it with Le Ligerien too who has been a great horse for us - Joe Tizzard, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looks held by a handful of these based on his last couple of runs
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 6l by Le Milos at Warwick in February and looked on the retreat when blundering away any hope he had in the C&D handicap here two months ago won by Dubai Days; others would appear to have more going for them.
Horse quote: 2023-03-18 at Kempton (18f): "Whistleinthedark has been going well since he went chasing and I was hopeful coming here today. He's been progressive and I think he'll go to Aintree next month for a handicap - Laura Morgan, trainer."
