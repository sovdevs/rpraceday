🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Thriving, all the more so since cheekpieces went on; up 4lb but still major appeal
🔦 Spotlight: His four most recent RPRs have been the best of his career, cheekpieces having eked out yet further improvement in wins over 8.6f and C&D here the last twice (both under Warren Fentiman); overcame a worse draw than tonight's here in December, and latest 4lb rise doesn't look prohibitive.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two C&D wins already this year, albeit in lower grade; drop back in trip is a plus
🔦 Spotlight: 4-4 record in 0-58 or lower company earlier this year included two C&D scores; shaping as if still in form in defeat since, though either or both of the step up to 1m4f and 0-70 class ultimately found him out back here latest; has the latter detail to deal with again this time.
