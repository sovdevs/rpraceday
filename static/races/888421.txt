🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner and scored at Wolverhampton last time; may find this a shade warm
🔦 Spotlight: Dual C&D winner who narrowly ended an 18-race losing run at Wolverhampton (5f, Tapeta) ten days ago; 4lb penalty puts him on his previous winning mark, but he may find this company a shade warm (all ten wins in Class 5/6 company).
