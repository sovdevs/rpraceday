💬 Comment: Well-supported winner of a 2m4f Wexford bumper last May, had a previous hurdles run
🔦 Spotlight: 80-1 for his debut in a Fairyhouse maiden hurdle last March when fading into seventh after a bad mistake two out; well-supported for a 2m4f Wexford bumper in May, and won readily; closely related to two hurdles winners for this yard, including the promising Goraibhmaithagat.

🔦 Spotlight: Took the notable scalp of prolific points winner Winged Leader at Dromahane last season, the middle leg of a point hat-trick for Ellmarie Holden; pulled up in two hunter chases; 100-1 when a clear second (over 40l in front of Siege Ofjadotville) on hurdling debut at Clonmel; this longer trip and stiffer track should suit.
