💬 Comment: Evens at Kempton (2m2f) nine days ago, perhaps about to get competitive when unseating
🔦 Spotlight: Very well handicapped on old hurdling form; not so hot this term, chasing on last two starts, but he was evens in a five-runner handicap at Kempton (2m2f, good) nine days ago and perhaps about to get competitive when unseating three out; has to be taken seriously in another small field today.
