🔦 Spotlight: £2,000 3yo; second foal; dam twice-raced half-sister to bumper and 2m5f hurdle winner La Perrotine (dam of Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Sizing John); won well in an Irish maiden point (yielding to soft) on debut in May 2023 against some notable rivals and fetched £75,000 soon afterwards; off since but needs a close look.

💬 Comment: 50-1, up with pace throughout when a close fourth of 13 at Kempton (good) on second start
🔦 Spotlight: Ridden both starts by Jamie Neild; down the field at Hereford in December, detached and off the bridle before halfway; 50-1 at Kempton (good) last month but went in contrasting fashion, up with the pace throughout and taking a close fourth of 13, which puts him firmly in the picture here.
