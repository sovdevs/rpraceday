🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Her standout effort came over 7f on Tapeta; drops in trip/class but with a point to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Placed over 7f at Wolverhampton on her second start but she has been heavily beaten in two 1m races since; this free-going filly could benefit from the drop in trip and this is weaker than the handicap she contested five weeks ago; still not a solid option though.
