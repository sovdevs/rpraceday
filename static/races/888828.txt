🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has picked up valuable experience in Graded races, well suited by the race conditions
🔦 Spotlight: Solid bumper form, highlighted by a Roscommon win and second to the smart William Munny at this venue; has held his own in Graded races since maiden hurdle win at Wexford; has strong claims based on his neck second to The Yellow Clay over this trip at Navan; outstayed over 2m7f at Limerick, this should suit better.
