🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 in 1m Tapeta events this year; up 3f for handicap debut; mark looks stiff
🔦 Spotlight: Too green to do himself justice in one turf run as a 2yo but he rewarded market support at Southwell on his return to action last month (1m) before following up at Newcastle (1m novice) 12 days ago; hit with a 14lb rise for that success; up in trip for handicap debut; can do better.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the fourth attempt when landing a 1m fillies' novice at Chelmsford last month; made all in a small-field 1m3f handicap at Southwell 12 days later; 3lb rise shouldn't prevent another prominent showing and her proven stamina is a plus point.

💬 Comment: Two good handicap runs, probably unsuited by run of the race behind Spirit Of Jura latest
🔦 Spotlight: Stepped up on his novice/maiden form when winning a 9.5f nursery at Wolverhampton in December; lack of pace in the race, rather than stamina, was probably his undoing when last of four (beaten under 2l) behind Spirit Of Jura at Southwell (1m3f) five weeks ago; remains capable of better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Similar form in four starts (two for this yard); up in trip for handicap debut; needs more
🔦 Spotlight: He has run to a similar level in all four starts (two for Joseph O'Brien in Ireland) and failed to improve for the addition of cheekpieces when third at Newcastle three weeks ago (1m); steps up markedly in trip and it's not sure to suit on pedigree.

🔦 Spotlight: Third in handicaps here (1m) and at Wolverhampton (9.5f; runner-up won since) on his last two starts; should stay this far (40-1 when well beaten in a C&D maiden on third start) but he's eligible for lesser races than this one.
