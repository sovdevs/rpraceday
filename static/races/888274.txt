🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sets a fair standard and will appreciate this return to better ground; leading contender.
🔦 Spotlight: Displayed a good deal of ability when touched off at Sandown (good to soft) in November on debut and although not really living up to that when a beaten favourite at Kempton last month, it was also encouraging considering he was reportedly unsuited by the soft ground; leading contender back on a quicker surface.

🔦 Spotlight: £90,000 purchase after finishing runner-up in an Irish point in December; made a promising start to his rules career for his new stable when filling the same position at Exeter (good to soft) last month and could be suited by this drop back in trip; one of two for the trainer; respected.

💬 Comment: Penalised for his recent course win and back down in trip but he's open to progress.
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled too hard on debut when well beaten at Exeter (1m5f) in October but left that effort well behind when narrowly opening his account here (2m2f, soft) seven weeks ago, settling better on the lead and seeing out the longer trip well; open to progress but comes back again in distance and has a penalty to carry.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Entitled to have improved for last month's debut but others have more pressing claims.
🔦 Spotlight: A half-sister to bumper/2m hurdle winner Potters Midnight; looked in need of the experience when 28l third of five on debut at Fakenham (2m, good); entitled to have come on for that but might find a few too good; down in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Makes debut with a hood fitted and would need to be a fair standard to figure.
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth foal; dam a French 1m3f Flat, 2m1f hurdle and 2m2f chase winner, out of a German 1m3f Listed winner; trainer 0-7 in bumpers in the last five years and she would have to be a fair standard to figure on this debut; runs in a hood.
