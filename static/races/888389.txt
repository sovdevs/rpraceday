💬 Comment: Four C&D wins since December; still feasibly treated but wouldn't want a tactical event
🔦 Spotlight: Fine record over C&D, winning four times since joining Gemma Tutty last October; nicely backed when beating male opposition 18 days ago and a 2lb rise is fair; strong claims but with the caveat that she wouldn't want a dawdle early.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed C&D winner; starts out for a 🆕 new yard off a fair mark; yard run two
🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f wins for Ivan Furtado, one of them here, and she's still relatively low mileage; first run back from a wind op may have been needed; has joined a 🆕 new yard (same owner) since and she's a sprinter of interest; worth a 📊 market check in relation to stablemate Powdering.
