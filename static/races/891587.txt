🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very lightly raced; won at Newcastle recently; he's just the type his trainer excels with
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French 4yo who, having had gelding/wind operations, made it 2-4 when winning at Newcastle (1m2f, AW) on his reappearance and second stable start; he's just the type his trainer excels with and an 8lb rise may well not stop him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winless since July 2023 but placed off reduced mark the last twice; could be thereabouts
🔦 Spotlight: 7yo who isn't the force of old and is without a win since July 2023 but he's run well to be placed off this reduced mark on his two outings this season (1m2f, AW/good) and could be thereabouts.
Horse quote: 2022-06-10 at Sandown (10f): "I think it was a smart performance and we have put the wheels back on track. Lord Protector ran well at Chester last time but he was drawn wide and that is a tight turning track. He preferred running in a straight line today and he only just does enough. He came with a long sustained run but he didn't want to get there too soon. However, he pulled out a bit more when the other horse started coming at him - Eamonn O'Connor, owners' racing manager."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Failed to kick on last year and sold for 14,000gns, but he's capable when fresh
🔦 Spotlight: Failed to kick on last season after winning on handicap/seasonal debut and sold out of Ollie Sangster's yard for 14,000gns in October; however, he's clearly capable when fresh and is not ruled out on this stable debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well treated on form as recent as last autumn but he's struggled this year
🔦 Spotlight: Well treated on form as recent as last autumn but tailed off on two outings in Bahrain earlier this year and same story at Doncaster last time.
Horse quote: 2023-10-14 at York (8f): "It was testing and we were scratching our heads in the final stages as we hadn't got the job done yet, fortunately he got his head in front. I thought I was going to win easily two furlongs out, but Whiskey Pete was waiting the whole last furlong and went away when one came to him - Hector Crouch, jockey."
