🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bolted up at Wincanton last time; things may not work out so favourably this time
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 14th-time lucky under rules with a powerful front-running display at Wincanton (2m4f, heavy) in January, winning by 12l; rider's 10lb claim useful in view of his 11lb higher mark, but whether things will work out so favourably this time remains to be seen.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A player if jumping better than last time; stable has a good recent record in this
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in his next two starts (including on handicap debut) after bolting up at Southwell (2m, heavy) in April last year, but some less-than-fluent jumping cost him at Wetherby (2m4f, soft) last month; a player if cutting out the errors this time for stable that has won three of the last five runnings.
