🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point winner who has made a promising start to her rules career; handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who was a very promising fourth on rules debut at Warwick (2m3f, good to soft) in January; made heavy weather of justifying short odds in modest Lingfield maiden (2m3f, heavy) last month but remains open to significant improvement if she handles the faster ground here.

🔦 Spotlight: Came good on handicap debut at Catterick (2m3f, good) in December, staying on well to cause 20-1 surprise; ought to have coped better with the soft ground when only seventh at Bangor last month but may yet have more to offer; sports first-time cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in December but has mixed record this season and has not won since 2021
🔦 Spotlight: Placed at Ludlow (2m5f, good to soft) in December and ran well for a long way when upped to 3m2f last time (disqualified after rider weighed in light) but has very mixed record this season and remains without a win since 2021; sports first-time cheekpieces; others preferred.

💬 Comment: Six-time winner over hurdles but very inconsistent in recent years; headgear switched here
🔦 Spotlight: Six hurdle wins, the latest from the front at Hexham (2m4f, good) in October; still on a workable mark but has become very inconsistent and needs to bounce back from a poor run last month; swaps usual blinkers for first-time visor.

🔦 Spotlight: Won Doncaster maiden (2m, good to soft) for Alan King last season but did not build upon that success and was sold for 1,400gns after a very poor Flat run last month; makes stable debut with quite a lot to prove.
