🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Close third off this mark latest and Billy Loughnane takes the reins now; new headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways at Southwell (1m) in November; best run since when close third over 9.4f at Wolverhampton ten days ago; the drop back to 1m looks ideal and Billy Loughnane takes the ride so there are reasons to be very hopeful from the same mark; also has first-time blinkers in place of cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Improved for cheekpieces when scoring over 1m2f in the mud at Salisbury in October; sold out of Eve Johnson Houghton's stable for 30,000gns later that month; the cheekpieces are left off by 🆕 new yard; betting perhaps the best guide to expectations back down in trip after five months off.
