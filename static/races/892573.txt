🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual winner gets her favoured good ground here and has leading claims if fit for return
🔦 Spotlight: Had a busy 2yo campaign, winning twice; landed Navan handicap (6f, good to yielding) off 72 on her final start of the season under a brilliant Jack Cleary ride; gets her favoured good ground here and has leading claims if fit for her return.
Horse quote: 2024-10-09 at Navan (6f): "I think Gazelle D'or has done very well to win that. The whole thing today was about just switching her off and getting her to come home good. She travelled lovely the whole way and, just when she got there, she just idled a small bit underneath me - Jack Cleary, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Last win came at Bellewstown (5f, good) last July off 74; tough sort was a beaten favourite when seventh over C&D on his return; hasn't looked like a winner in waiting in two starts since but is well treated now.
Horse quote: 2023-10-04 at Navan (6f): "We made a mistake as I thought Rathbranchurch might get the seven in Fairyhouse, as it's a handy seven, but he doesn't seem to get that trip. This trip here is ideal for him. He's entered at the Curragh on Saturday and we might have to go again - Mick Mulvany, trainer"

💬 Comment: Last win in September 2022; risky but well handicapped if he's fully tuned after break
🔦 Spotlight: Last win was in 5f premier handicap at this course in September 2022 off 90; reached a career-high of 94, has dropped to competitive mark (73); beaten only 1.75l in C&D handicap from 6lb higher last summer; risky but well handicapped if he's fully tuned after break.
Horse quote: 2022-09-24 at Curragh (5f): "We've decided that's it for the year for Gordon Bennett. He's had a great time and there is nothing left. These sprinters seem to get better with age and he's not heavily raced. We'll spend the winter building him up and he could just be stronger again. The great thing is that he's learning to behave a bit. Gary [Carroll] said he was never as calm as today and we noticed it in the yard too. A lot of the quirkiness might be going out of him - Dick Brabazon, trainer."

💬 Comment: Improved effort at Naas last month when third of 15 but unproven on good ground
🔦 Spotlight: Has a low rating for a maiden winner; however, it was a weak race that she won at Sligo (5.5f, yielding to soft) last May; disappointed over C&D on handicap debut; improved effort at Naas last month when third of 15; unproven on good ground.
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Sligo (5.5f): "Sakakawea jumped a bit slow and I was caught in a pocket most of the way, but it helped her because she's a forward-going filly and it settled her well. She travelled well and I got a good split off the bend. She's always worked well and her runs probably hadn't shown that, but that was more like it so hopefully she'll go forward - Billy Lee, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Navan (5f): "Irish Rumour handled the 5f very well at the Curragh last time so we were confident today, although I was a little worried about the ground. She has a plenty of boot and comes good for you in the second half of the race - Dylan Browne McMonagle, rider."

Horse quote: 2023-08-27 at Naas (6f): "Distillate has improved all the time. Hopefully the handicapper won't be too hard on her and she should be a good fun filly. We'll probably go back to Dundalk for the winter - Ado McGuinness, trainer"
