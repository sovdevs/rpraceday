💬 Comment: Beat Leadenhall Street at Kempton & 6lb better off today; perhaps unsuited by track latest
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Leadenhall Street (and a couple of other next-time-out winners) when winning a Kempton novice in January; only fifth at Lingfield on his nursery debut two weeks ago but that track perhaps not ideal; gets 6lb from Leadenhall Street this time and he's one to be interested in.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5f win here on stable debut before a near miss over 6f at Lingfield; less good last time
🔦 Spotlight: Came from an unpromising position to win a 5f handicap here on his stable debut in December; went close over 6f at Lingfield next time but unable to back it up back at Lingfield eight weeks ago (Class 2); career best required.
