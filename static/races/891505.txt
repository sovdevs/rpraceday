🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Again has to concede weight to promising opposition but commands respect
🔦 Spotlight: Both runs at Newcastle; very green on debut but stayed on best to win going away over 1m and probably bumped into a smart prospect when a clear second back there under a penalty (1m2f); again has to concede weight to promising opposition but commands respect.

🔦 Spotlight: Frankel colt who cost 475,000gns as a yearling; slow to break but produced plenty of good late work to finish fourth at Nottingham (extended 1m, soft; 7-2) and he's in the Derby; has to rate a very nice prospect.

🔦 Spotlight: By Dubawi and out of a close relative to Enable; could never land a blow after losing lengths at the start at Yarmouth (1m2f, good; behind Minhad) but he was 5-4 favourite and looks sure to leave that form behind with some experience behind him.
