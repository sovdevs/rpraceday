🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won first and latest of five chases; considered despite poor earlier record on good ground
🔦 Spotlight: Has an in-and-out record in his five chases but that includes wins on the first and latest attempts, latterly over C&D, and he was miles out of the handicap when pulled up on penultimate start; considered despite a poor record on good ground in bumpers and over hurdles.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner; surged back to form with second at Huntingdon (3m) last time
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a double last winter, the second leg over C&D; struggled badly this season, tried in different types of headgear and given wind surgery before penultimate start, before he surged back to form with second at Huntingdon (3m) last time; that form puts him back into serious calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only fifth of six on chase debut latest but this step back up in trip will presumably help
🔦 Spotlight: Tends to need plenty of riding and sole win (2m4f) was in January 2024 on handicap debut; pretty reliable since and although chase debut last time saw him finish only fifth of six, this step back up in trip will presumably help him and he's one of the youngsters in this field; needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: Second of 15 on chase debut at Exeter (2m3f, good to soft) in December but ran way below market expectations over about 2m7f on both starts since, never going well last time; wore cheekpieces on seven of his last eight starts and now tries blinkers; 🔥 big player if judged on the Exeter run.
