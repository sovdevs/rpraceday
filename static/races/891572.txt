💬 Comment: Always prominent before edging out a Hannon-trained favourite at Newbury
🔦 Spotlight: 45,000gns yearling by the stable's shock Coventry winner Nando Parrado; always prominent before edging out a Hannon-trained favourite at Newbury (5f, good; 17-2) where Chale Chalo and Siren Suit finished behind; trainer already harbouring Royal Ascot ambitions; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-04-11 at Newbury (5f): "Inca Heights tell us when he comes back. This weather will determine where we go, but we'll try to keep him upwardly mobile in the build up to Ascot - Clive Cox, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Made hard work of justifing short-priced favouritism at Leicester (5f, good to firm) and the opposition wasn't strong, despite the runner-up winning since (now 1-4); however, evidently held in some regard by his top yard and should improve.
