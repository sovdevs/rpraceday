🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Might get going too late at this trip but he's had a fair season and could be thereabouts
🔦 Spotlight: With the ground unlikely to be testing he might get going too late at this trip, but the stiff track is in his favour and he's run well more often than not during this first chasing campaign, bumping into an 🔍 unexposed winner when 13l second at Ayr a fortnight ago; could be thereabouts.
