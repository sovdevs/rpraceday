🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Broke losing run on penultimate start but isn't consistent and below that last time (bled)
🔦 Spotlight: 6-24 over fences, though hasn't been too predictable in recent times; followed Catterick win with a poor run back on a sound surface at Doncaster (reportedly bled) and he has something to prove.
