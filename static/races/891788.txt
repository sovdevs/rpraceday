🔦 Spotlight: Record of 2-3 (over 7f) in her first season last year, winning at Wolverhampton (AW debut) the final time; gives the impression this new trip will suit; looks the type to improve further this term; respected.
Horse quote: 2024-06-12 at Yarmouth (7f): "Sky Safari has had a couple of niggles but she's always looked a nice filly. She's shown ability at home, she's a big girl but she's also got an engine as well. She showed a really good attitude inside the last furlong - James Fanshawe, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stiff task in C&D Listed event on reappearance and this is much more realistic
🔦 Spotlight: Kicked off her 2024 campaign with two wins (maiden/handicap) on turf; no further progress since but faced a stiff task in C&D Listed event on reappearance and this is much more realistic.
Horse quote: 2024-06-29 at Newmarket (July) (8f): "We were gutted Mercury Day was balloted out of the Sandringham Handicap at Royal Ascot as we've always liked her and she's from a good Juddmonte family. She's in a mile and a quarter handicap at the July Festival but Jim said to stick at a mile for now - Conrad Allen, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Placed a few times on AW but has shown best form, including two wins (maiden/handicap; both 1m) on turf, last July; lacks recent match practice and record suggests she's likely set for a supporting role.
Horse quote: 2024-07-29 at Windsor (8f): "Atlantis Blue used to be quite headstrong but I managed to drop her in and she's learning her trade. She's well handicapped and seems to be going forward - Jim Crowley, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Turf success last June; lacked consistency afterwards in 2024; not solid
🔦 Spotlight: Opened her account in 1m novice event on turf last June; lacked consistency afterwards in 2024, latterly on AW; capable of being involved off current mark but isn't a solid option.

🔦 Spotlight: Two AW wins for previous yard; unconvincing efforts this winter for new stable, having been friendless in the betting both times; best watched unless the market signals go the other way.
