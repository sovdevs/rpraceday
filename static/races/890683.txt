🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**

🔦 Spotlight: He has always had lots of ability and gelding/wind operations last summer have prompted improvement from him this year; C&D win in January was more convincing than the neck margin indicates and he backed that up with a comfortable Listed win at Lingfield in February; beaten under a penalty in Listed events twice since but it was 5f on the first occasion and he was checked in his run back on turf three weeks ago; it will take a mighty effort to defy a BHA mark of 110 but it's not out of the question.

🔦 Spotlight: Prominent racer who has done well on AW this winter having been ✂️ gelded and tried in headgear, winning twice over 6f at Southwell and also running well over C&D; 4lb higher than for his latest win and needs another step forward to take this.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "Everything fell into place today really. We Never Stop jumped well, and they went a blistering gallop, so I just sat off the lead a little bit and it worked out really well. I had something to aim at going to the furlong pole, and he had a good look when he got there, but he's done it comfortably in the end - Shane Gray, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Done well on AW this winter, winning twice at Southwell; further progress required today
🔦 Spotlight: Prominent racer who has done well on AW this winter having been ✂️ gelded and tried in headgear, winning twice over 6f at Southwell and also running well over C&D; 4lb higher than for his latest win and needs another step forward to take this.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Uninspiring form figures but almost certainly well handicapped & latest C&D run promising
🔦 Spotlight: Looked good when surging home in the 2023 Wokingham at Royal Ascot (stable debut) and he was beaten under one length in a French Group 1 on his next start; struggled for consistency since but there were flashes of retaining his ability last year; well held on first two AW runs this winter but his midfield finish behind Marshman over C&D in January was much more encouraging, poorly positioned and meeting trouble but finishing with running left in him; probably not straightforward but almost certainly well treated now.
Horse quote: 2023-08-06 at Deauville (6.5f): "Saint Lawrence has run an absolute stormer and I think if the pace had been stronger, he'd have nearly won. He's definitely improving and he's proved himself at Group 1 level; he's taken a big step up from winning a handicap at Ascot - Hollie Doyle, jockey."

💬 Comment: Strong C&D form; capable off this mark & latest effort was eyecatching; now gets headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Capable of smart form on AW and better than ever last summer, third in the Group 3 Chipchase Stakes over C&D in June (strong form) before winning a Racing League handicap at Wolverhampton off this mark; rather lost his way after that but there were green shoots of recovery at Kempton three weeks ago (7f), finishing off strongly in a race that didn't set up favourably for those held up; interesting contender with cheekpieces now reached for.
Horse quote: 2023-11-18 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "Willem Twee is a lovely horse. It was quite a tactical race, the pace was slow and I elected to stay three deep but to keep cover. I probably delivered him into the race early enough. He's a very nice horse, he's got a future. He gave me a lovely feel as I started to improve into the race round the turn - Oisin Murphy, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: As good as ever this winter, badly hampered when launching his challenge latest; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Looked better than ever when winning at Southwell (6f) in January; solid effort over 5f here next time and would surely have gone close to rewarding strong market support back at Southwell five weeks ago but for getting hampered against the rail over 1f out when launching his challenge; this is hot but he's dangerous off a low weight.
Horse quote: 2023-06-03 at Epsom (6f): "We were thinking Badri was just an all-weather horse. We ran him at Beverley as we thought a stiff five would suit. He romped home and he wasn't disgraced at York. It didn't look like he was coming down the hill but he was doing his best work where it mattered most. We tried him on the grass last year and he didn't really look like he suited it but my horses are running much better this year and that is sometimes how it goes. We were thinking about the Gosforth Park Cup as he's unbeaten over five furlongs at Newcastle, and there's also a big five-furlong handicap at Ascot in July - we had that in mind thinking that a stiff five at Ascot would suit him - Ruth Carr, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful sprinter on AW, albeit not without some quirks; ended 2024 in fine form and he also ran well at Dundalk on his return from a three-month break last month; whether he's well-enough treated for a race of this nature remains to be seen (only fourth at Lingfield last Good Friday when rated 4lb lower).
Horse quote: 2024-11-01 at Dundalk (AW) (6f): "Six furlongs and coming off a good gallop on this surface really suits DAAMBERDIPLOMAT. He does get seven but a proper strongly-run six is ideal for him. He's good fresh so we liked his chance coming here this evening - Ben Coen, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Capable on AW & ran well after a short break last month; others look better treated though
🔦 Spotlight: Useful sprinter on AW, albeit not without some quirks; ended 2024 in fine form and he also ran well at Dundalk on his return from a three-month break last month; whether he's well-enough treated for a race of this nature remains to be seen (only fourth at Lingfield last Good Friday when rated 4lb lower).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good record on AW in Ireland; perhaps a shade high in the weights for this though
🔦 Spotlight: Fine record on the AW track at Dundalk, winning four of his seven races there; poorly drawn when unplaced at Lingfield last Good Friday (when rated 6lb lower); surplus stamina no bad thing on his first visit here but he's 6lb higher than for his latest success and perhaps a shade high in the weights for a race of this nature.
Horse quote: 2024-11-27 at Dundalk (AW) (6f): "Apache Outlaw has improved plenty and is an out-and-out sprinter who enjoys a fast pace. We might come back for the all-weather finals at Newcastle - Ado McGuinness, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won a competitive Kempton handicap (6f) in February from the front (tongue tied for the first time) but he was gifted a soft lead and they dawdled until halfway; less good over 7f twice since and others bring more pressing claims; blinkers now tried.
Horse quote: 2025-02-12 at Kempton (AW) (6f): "There didn't seem to be much pace so when Golden Mind broke well I was able to get across and went fairly steady, getting the race my own way to be honest, and he's quickened up and done it well in the end. He gets 7f and I could see him going up in trip again - Oisin Orr, jockey, talking to Racing TV."
