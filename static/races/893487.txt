🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 9lb rise for Limerick win largely offset by rider's claim and good chance of a follow up
🔦 Spotlight: No impact in three maidens but much improved on second handicap attempt over this trip at Limerick early this month under forcing tactics and first-time tongue-tie when first two clear; 9lb rise largely offset by rider's claim and good chance of a follow up.

🔦 Spotlight: Betrayed 25-1 odds with fine handicap debut run over this trip at Limerick early this month, up with pace throughout in finishing a clear second (winner won again next time off 10lb higher) on good; 5lb rise but looks nicely handicapped and is a 🔥 big player.

🔦 Spotlight: Modest for Dan Skelton but off the mark for the Elliott yard at second attempt in 2m4f Down Royal handicap last month and decent effort off 8lb higher mark at Downpatrick despite not quite seeing out 2m6f trip; cheekpieces tried here dropped in trip and has to be on the shortlist.
