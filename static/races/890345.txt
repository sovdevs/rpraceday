💬 Comment: Failed to progress in handicaps at end of 2yo season but leading yard perseveres
🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each of his first three runs, narrowly seeing off now smart stablemate Roi De France in novice at Windsor (1m, good to firm) in June; didn't make the expected progress in handicaps subsequently but still early days and top stable has stuck with him; market confidence could prove significant.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up three times last season, including reappearance; had heavy ground as an excuse for a rare below-par run on final start and this largely consistent mare holds each-way claims on her return to action.
Horse quote: 2023-07-15 at Ascot (8f): "Roarin' Success had a little niggle at the beginning of the year so we've taken out time with her. I thought she'd need that on that ground, so I'm nicely surprised with that performance. We'll stick to a mile and find another handicap - Harry Charlton, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: Second in this off 9lb higher on 2024 reappearance and resumes with yard going well
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in this race (good to soft) off 9lb higher on last year's reappearance; mixed record later in 2024 but resumes with his stable among the winners; gets the vote.
Horse quote: 2023-08-26 at Goodwood (10f): "It's a shame Sweet Reward has won so far because it's rather flattered him. These older need a bit of help sometimes and they go and do that and the handicapper thinks they've improved a stone. He's getting on and you have to get what you can, when you can. You never know what you're going to get from him. He doesn't like it firm and he doesn't like it heavy - Jonathan Portman, trainer."

💬 Comment: All seven wins over 1m at Brighton and probably best watched away from there on return
🔦 Spotlight: All seven turf wins over 1m at Brighton on ground ranging from soft to good to firm; first outing for 199 days and record suggests it's best to look elsewhere away from Brighton.
Horse quote: 2024-08-07 at Brighton (8f): "Uncle Dick is an absolute legend. He's won for all my apprentices either this year or last and just loves it at Brighton, he's just a different horse there. He'll have to go again on Thursday. If I don't run him in that there's not another race he can run in at Brighton this year so we might as well give it a go. He's such a good horse to have and the Brighton Mile is an amazing race to win. He's usually winning 2,500GBP races so it's nice to win one worth four times more - Eve Johnson Houghton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All seven wins over 1m at Brighton and probably best watched away from there on return
🔦 Spotlight: All seven turf wins over 1m at Brighton on ground ranging from soft to good to firm; first outing for 199 days and record suggests it's best to look elsewhere away from Brighton.
