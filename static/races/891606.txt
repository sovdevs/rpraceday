🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Exploited lower turf mark at Redcar recently & remains well treated on this year's AW form
🔦 Spotlight: Made it three wins from his last ten runs when exploiting lower turf mark at Redcar (6f, good to firm) recently; won over 7f on AW last October; under a 5lb penalty he remains well treated on this year's AW form; key player.

🔦 Spotlight: Reappeared with a C&D win (good) on April 2; only fifth of 14 under a penalty at Catterick seven days later but he's running off 3lb lower today and is back at what may be his favourite course; firmly in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running well in defeat on Newcastle AW in March and won on turf last August; in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Headstrong mare who has been beaten on her last 11 starts but was running well at Newcastle (7f, AW) in March and she scored on turf at Ayr last August; there's every chance she'll be bang there.
Horse quote: 2023-11-19 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "We put Keep Me Stable out again because she came out of her last win in great form and we wanted to give her a chance. Tommie (Jakes, jockey) was taking 7lb off and when a filly is in good form you have to run them, you don't if they're not. She did it nicely and it was great. Being at Newcastle suits her because she can run against the rail and I think she likes the straight seven furlongs - Linda Perratt, trainer."
