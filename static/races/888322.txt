🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D win in December; well beaten at Bangor since but in a warm novice; leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Point runner-up who was a fair third on hurdle debut over C&D (good) in November then won over C&D (good to soft) in December; well beaten at Bangor (2m, soft) last time but this is a much easier race and he holds leading claims now back here and back on better ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has shown ability in the past but well beaten at 80-1 in recent Carlisle novice
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point-to-point bumper on debut last February and ran okay on hurdle debut at Newcastle (2m, good) in November; however, he's failed to build on that, in points and a novice hurdle, and has to raise his game.
