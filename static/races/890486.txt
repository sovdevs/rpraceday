🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chance on positive effort at Fakenham (2m) penultimate start; poor run just last weekend.
🔦 Spotlight: Three Flat wins at 1m2f in 2021; mixed messages over hurdles; chance if able replicate her positive effort at Fakenham (2m, good to soft) on penultimate start, but a poor run at Plumpton on Sunday (2m, good; beaten 57l after reportedly running freely) raises obvious concerns.
Horse quote: 2021-08-31 at Epsom (10f): "Arenas Del Tiempo wears her heart on her sleeve and is going in the right direction. She's rangey and can get a bit excitable, but I think she can go on with another winter under her belt. She's suited to Epsom - the twists and turns - and I'm already thinking what we can do with her here next year - Simon Dow, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tailed off on Sunday's handicap debut at Plumpton (2m4f, good); cheekpieces now applied.
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner; low-key under rules, sizable odds in three novice/maiden contests (1m7f-2m3f) and tailed off on last weekend's handicap debut at Plumpton (2m4f, good; 9-1); cheekpieces applied seeking improvement; Bryan Carver takes over in the saddle.
