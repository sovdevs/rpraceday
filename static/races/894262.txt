💬 Comment: Caught the eye on recent stable debut at Leicester and can build upon that performance
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Yarmouth (11.4f, soft) last October for Rae Guest and caught the eye when sixth in a first-time tongue-tie (retained) on stable/seasonal debut at Leicester (1m4f, good to firm) three weeks ago, when she travelled well but had to wait for a clear run; can build on that performance.
Horse quote: 2023-08-10 at Yarmouth (10f): "I think we'll look for some softer ground for Afloat next time as it was good to soft when we declared but now it's good to firm. We had to run as she was 2lb well in - Rae Guest, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Won on reappearance at Leicester (1m, good to soft) last May and campaign concluded with two good placed efforts over 1m2f on soft; won on good to firm/good ground in 2023; could play a leading role on her return.
Horse quote: 2023-07-20 at Chepstow (8f): "We were disappointed when Azahara Palace got beat at Catterick, but I think the course caught her out. She's quite difficult to train, and was still learning here, but hopefully she'll keep progressing - Hughie Morrison, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Ex-French 4yo who could pose a bigger threat now back down in trip on second British start
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten on his stable and seasonal debut at Brighton (1m4f) a fortnight ago but he may have needed that run and he had some useful form at up to 9.5f in France; wears a first-time tongue-tie and could be more competitive today now back down in trip; watch the betting.

Horse quote: 2023-01-13 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Dayzee has always showed us plenty at home. Jack just let her get into a rhythm and he said she was still a bit green. She will go a bit further - Mark Fahey, trainer."
