🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Veteran, formerly useful; tends to start slowly but still capable when things fall right
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran, formerly pretty useful; tends to start slowly but was still good enough to win Class 5 handicap in December; blew the start and tried to challenge wide around the turn in steadily run 6f Class 5 AW Wolverhampton handicap latest; could be competitive again now from lower turf mark if not giving them too much of a start.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "Brian The Snail is an old boy who knows the game. Sometimes he breaks out a bit slow - like he's done today - but he thrives being hung onto and it's paid off - Ryan Kavanagh, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
