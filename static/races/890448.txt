🔦 Spotlight: First two chase wins over 2m5f but he's very effective over further, as when chasing home a big 🚀 improver at Hexham (3m, good) in October and winning in good style at Catterick (3m1f, good to soft) in February; fair 2m4f run in a Series Final here since; solid chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Irish point; hurdle winner; pulled up/well beaten last twice; had wind op; chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Dead-heated for Irish point win; winning start for yard on hurdle debut (heavy) last January; pulled up and soundly beaten in two handicap runs after but he's had wind surgery since and is not dismissed now chasing.
