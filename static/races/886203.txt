💬 Comment: Reverted to hurdles with fine third in the Grade 1 Long Walk; leading claims on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Has an inconsistent profile over fences but he reappeared with a dominant handicap chase win at Ascot (3m5f, good) in November before a fine third in the Grade 1 Long Walk Hurdle there (3m, good to soft) in December, which was his first hurdle run since April 2022; leading claims on that latest form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In pretty good heart in handicaps the last twice but something to find now up in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Completed hat-trick with commanding win in big field at Aintree's Grand National meeting (3m, good to soft) last April and he's run pretty well in defeat in handicaps the last twice (3m1f/3m, soft); however, he goes up in grade today and has something to find.

💬 Comment: Won his first three starts, but pulled up over fences last month after an absence
🔦 Spotlight: Won his first three starts (including a maiden hurdle for Willie Mullins); then absent until Windsor last month, when pulled up on his stable debut in a hot conditions chase; this very lightly raced 7yo may have needed the run and now wears a tongue-tie, but others have far less to prove.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a Grade 2 novice hurdle at Doncaster (3m, good) last January and he's had wind surgery since being pulled up here in November on his only run this season; he's a lightly raced 7yo who retains potential but a leap of improvement is needed and it's hard to be confident after last time.
