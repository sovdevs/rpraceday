🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Southwell and Wolverhampton this year but only 1-27 on turf.
🔦 Spotlight: Has been in great heart on AW this year, winning over the minimum distance at Southwell in February and Wolverhampton the following month; just 1-27 on turf, however, and small field may not play to his strengths.
Horse quote: 2021-04-23 at Sandown (5f): "I felt justified running Nelson Gay in the Norfolk last season after he was beaten at Yarmouth, but it just didn't happen for him last year until he fell in in a bad maiden at Southwell. He won well at Wolverhampton last time, which was the first stepping stone to better things and he was very good. I didn't expect him to win eight lengths, but he's in a race at Goodwood next week or we'll go for the five-furlong handicap at Royal Ascot - Richard Hughes, trainer."
