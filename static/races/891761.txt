🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the Grade 1 Bowl at Aintree recently; he's the one to beat on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Impressive in last season's Arkle (2m, soft) and rediscovered that abundant promise when upped in trip to win the Grade 1 Bowl at Aintree (3m1f, good to soft) 23 days ago; has run well on good to yielding going (unraced on good); he's the one to beat if repeating that latest form.
Horse quote: 2025-04-03 at Aintree (25f): "It's great that Patrick [Mullins, jockey] got on Gaelic Warrior. I thought Paul [Townend] would ride him, but he chose Embassy Gardens. His main target was to get him round in one piece, and then if he was able to do that we all know he has the class. I'd been a little disappointed in his two previous runs, when he just didn't fire, but he'd run well enough at Leopardstown and we thought he'd be better for it, but then he just wasn't right for Cheltenham. I thought if I didn't run him here I'd have to wait until Punchestown, so I thought we may as well run him here to get a race into him anyhow, so he's done a bit more than that - Willie Mullins, trainer."

💬 Comment: Posted third Grade 1 win in the Ascot Chase in February; trainer has good record in race
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 2-2 for the season and posted his third Grade 1 win when readily making all in the Ascot Chase (2m5f, good) in February; excels at Ascot and hasn't shone on either visit here, but those were in 2021 and 2022 and he's a strong form contender; trainer has a good record in this race.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Ascot (21f): "I knew Pic d'Orhy was right today - he looked great - and he put them to the sword. I'd say that was probably a career-best from him and he's ten. He loves it round here, and this is the sort of race that suits him. We've always thought Cheltenham wouldn't suit and we won't go to Cheltenham, so we'll try to get him ready for Aintree again and get him there in top form - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on song with Topham Handicap win off big weight and he could be in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in last season's Champion Chase and, after a difficult season, he returned to form to win the Topham Handicap off a big weight at Aintree (2m5f, good to soft) recently; also effective on good ground; 🔍 unexposed at this sort of trip (unraced beyond 2m5f) and he could be in the mix.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Aintree (21f): "They went a very strong gallop the whole way. I missed the start - I wanted to pop Gentleman De Mee out handy, but the way things worked out, he stood at the start a little bit and I was at the back most of the way, but when I turned away from the stands going down to Bechers, he just started winging fences and getting himself a nice position. I knew they had gone quick and I was happy sitting there going into the fourth-last and the third-last, and going to the second-last I was lucky enough that a gap came off the rail, and I was able to scoot up there. The loose horse was no help to Johnny Burke, but made no real difference to me. This horse won a Grade One a couple of seasons ago and was second in the Champion Chase, so that was a fair performance off 11st 11lb. This is his time of year - Mark Walsh, jockey."

💬 Comment: 11yo who ended long losing run in Thurles Grade 2 in January; others have stronger claims
🔦 Spotlight: 11yo who ended a long losing run when beating stablemate Classic Getaway by 6l in Grade 2 at Thurles in January (2m5f, good); brought down ten fences out in the Grand National three weeks ago; it's possible he might run into a place but a few of the others have stronger claims.
Horse quote: 2025-01-19 at Thurles (21f): "Appreciate It probably missed his prime when he got injured after winning the Supreme so it is great for him to win such a prestigious race as this today. I think he loved the ground and dropping back to a Grade 2 helped as well - Patrick Mullins, assistant trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Grade 1 novice here in December 2023 but needs to be better than ever today
🔦 Spotlight: Won the Grade 1 Henry VIII Novices' Chase here (1m7f, heavy) in December 2023 and comfortably won handicap at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) last November; the return to Sandown is an interesting angle but he's been well beaten the last twice and needs to be better than ever today; headgear applied.
Horse quote: 2023-11-12 at Sandown (20f): "Le Patron got it all his own way out in front, but I'll be quite honest, I'm amazed he won as easily as he did as he won a bad race at Fontwell and the runner-up has since been beaten in a 0-100. Blow Your Wad is a decent horse and he had good form and Henri The Second was a Grade Two winner over hurdles, but he has done that very well. His greatest asset is his jumping and what a place to bring a horse that jumps like he does. He never got out of second gear really. It has exceeded my expectations what he has done. He has always been a horse that we liked but we nurtured him last season with a view to going chasing this season and it has been so far so good. You could look at the Scilly Isles back here in February. He doesn't have to make the running as well but as he had the experience over fences Jamie (Moore) wanted to keep it simple - Gary Moore, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hard to win with nowadays but frequently runs very well in defeat; each-way contender
🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from his last 20 starts and pulled up in the Grand National three weeks ago; below-par third in this 12 months ago; however, he frequently runs extremely well in defeat and has twice finishing second in Grade 1s here; each-way contender back down in trip if last time hasn't left a mark.
Horse quote: 2022-11-19 at Haydock (21.5f): "Hitman was a little bit keen and fresh at Aintree the other day and needed that run and we let him bowl along in front. He settled and galloped and jumped. For a six-year-old rated 160, we've been patient with him and he's run some really good races for a young horse and is just becoming the finished article now. He's got an entry for the King George and I'd say that's where we'll be heading. I might give him a couple of other entries, but I'd say the plan would be to go to the King George - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

💬 Comment: Highly creditable fourth in Grade 1 novice at Aintree; needs another career best today
🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 2 novice at Wincanton (2m4f, good) last November and posted a career best when highly creditable fourth in the Grade 1 Manifesto Novices' Chase at Aintree 23 days ago (2m4f, good to soft; his ninth chase start); his form needs to go to another new level if he's to come out on top today.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Wincanton (20f): "I'm stopping short of calling it top-class form but for horses that like that ground it's got to be a good race. The second has worn his heart on his sleeve but some days you win sometimes you lose. We'll see what happens, the Pendil could be the starting point.

Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Gowran Park (20f): "It was a good performance and Classic Getaway has been improving all season. Danny [Mullins, jockey] was keen to stress that the three fences in the straight made a big difference as his jumping brought him into the race without any effort and he had that final kick.

🔦 Spotlight: Best known for his exploits in the big 2m4f handicap chases at Cheltenham; however, even on his best form he has something to find in this field and he's been pulled up the last twice; first-time blinkers replace cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Cheltenham (20f): "That was a smashing run and I can't fault the horse. Off a mark of 155, that was probably a career best to be honest. Ga Law slipped turning in which didn't really help him but you can't fault his effort. He lost his momentum and had to get going again but it hasn't cost him the race.
