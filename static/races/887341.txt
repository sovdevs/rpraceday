üî¶ Spotlight: Won two of his three races in France; beaten 10l in the end in a Grade 2 here on Trials day (New course) but he was the only one remotely to threaten Triumph favourite East India Dock and there was a long way back to the third; strong traveller who could benefit from the sharper test offered by the Old course and this mark might underestimate him; unraced on ground quicker than soft but his pedigree bodes well in that respect; üî• big player.

üí¨ Comment: 1m4f Flat winner; progressing nicely over hurdles and trainer Joseph O'Brien targets this
üî¶ Spotlight: Flat form hardly fills the eye but she was a 1m4f winner and has taken well to hurdling, getting off the mark last time at Fairyhouse (yielding) by narrowly repelling Slurricane; her jumping remains a cause for concern but she's closely matched with Total Look on their previous clash and Joseph O'Brien has successfully targeted this race (two wins since 2019); interesting with cheekpieces applied.

üí¨ Comment: Has course experience and he's better than he showed on heavy ground last time
üî¶ Spotlight: Progress on the Flat featured a 1m2f maiden win on good ground; has wasted no time in raising his profile as a hurdler and this Navan maiden winner pocketed valuable course experience when a rallying third behind dead-heaters Quantock Hills and Teriferma here in December (good to soft); beaten since in a Punchestown heavy-ground handicap won by Slurricane, but can jump better than he did that day and nothing was finishing stronger; has more scope than your typical ex-Flat 4yo; makes the shortlist in first-time headgear.

üî¶ Spotlight: Talented Flat performer and encouragingly as good as ever in a first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) when winning a 2m AW handicap 17 days ago; his 4l second to leading Triumph hope East India Dock in October (good) now looks a really smart effort and, after winning well at Sandown (soft), he perhaps didn't fancy a foggy Chepstow when comfortably held in a Grade 2 over Christmas; consistent in the main and this streetwise 4yo can't be dismissed; blinkers are the choice of headgear this time.

üí¨ Comment: Lofty aspirations are shelved for now and Paul Townend takes over for handicap debut
üî¶ Spotlight: Promising French form but has had to settle for minor honours in two Graded races, both at Leopardstown, in Ireland and was unable to exploit a soft lead in the latest; lofty aspirations appear dashed for now and it's a struggle to consider this mark as lenient, but with Paul Townend committing to the cause there's good reason to believe he can raise his game; the return of a tongue-tie he wore in France could also be significant.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Unlucky not have won at Naas last time in a race that's been a great guide to this
üî¶ Spotlight: A slow-burner in France where she took four goes to get off the mark; highly tried on stable debut but on another day (her jumping lacked fluency and she found trouble in running) she would surely have won a rated hurdle at Naas (in reapplied tongue-tie) last time that has thrown up four of the last six winners of this race; that promise has triggered a tough initial handicap mark and there's a bit to prove away from soft/heavy ground, but there's also a strong suspicion she has more to offer.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Recent Flat winner; unwise to knock latest defeat over hurdles; this race could suit him
üî¶ Spotlight: Good Flat horse before embarking on his hurdling career and a recent winning stroll on the AW (long odds-on in new tongue-tie/cheekpieces combination) should have buoyed confidence levels; already has Listed honours over hurdles and he was conceding lumps of weight (and raced freely) when coming up shy on ground too soft at Newbury; today's bigger-field scenario could suit him and he's one of many with each-way claims.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Coming along nicely until struggling in a Grade 2 here; soft ground was a feasible excuse
üî¶ Spotlight: Inferior Flat form to a few of these but he's making a name for himself over hurdles and has a similar profile to Quantock Hills (with whom he's closely matched on bare form), having looked on an upward curve until fading away in a Grade 2 here in January; that was his first time on soft ground (won on good and good to soft) so there's reason to believe he'll run better this time; the tongue-tie worn throughout over hurdles is joined by cheekpieces that he wore once on the Flat (finished sixth).

üî¶ Spotlight: Low-grade Flat winner over 1m6f; has soon raised his profile as a hurdler and, after chasing home good horses in two maidens (just behind Holy See in the first), he ran into another smart prospect in a Grade 3 at Naas; deserves his chance in a race of this nature and rates a lively outsider with the return to forecast better ground a likely plus (encountered soft/heavy so far over hurdles).

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: It goes against the grain to trust one with his exposed profile in a race of this nature
üî¶ Spotlight: Had plenty of racing on the Flat; 2-7 over hurdles so he's more exposed than some of these, and heading here on the back of a fall is not ideal, though he was in the process of running well at Musselburgh (Listed race on good to soft) when taking that tumble; however, it goes against the grain to trust one with his profile in a race this competitive.
