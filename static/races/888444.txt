🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Down to a career-low mark under Hollie Doyle, but has become wildly inconsistent
🔦 Spotlight: Headgear worn for his three wins is on for the first time since joining this yard, which is a positive; he's down to a career-low mark too under Hollie Doyle, but has become wildly inconsistent.
