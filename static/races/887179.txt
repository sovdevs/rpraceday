🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on song with good second at Newcastle; key player if seeing out this longer trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won on handicap debut at Stratford (extended 2m2f, soft) in October then bounced back from lesser run at Sandown to finish second at Newcastle (2m1f, soft) last time; didn't see out 2m4f on heavy ground at Sandown but may have the necessary stamina for today's assignment; key player if so.

🔦 Spotlight: Won when back over hurdles at Leicester (2m4f, heavy) last month; beaten 12l into second of 15 when unpenalised at Wincanton (2m4f, heavy) nine days later and a 6lb rise has now kicked in, but it was still a creditable effort last time and she can give another good account.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Stratford in October and perhaps good ground didn't suit at Southwell in November
🔦 Spotlight: Well-beaten third at Southwell (2m4f, good) in November last time and she needs to prove her stamina, but perhaps the ground wasn't ideal and two starts ago she stayed on well to win at Stratford (2m, heavy) on her second handicap start; retains potential and is not written off.
