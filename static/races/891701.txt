Horse quote: 2024-05-08 at Fontwell (26f): "The Bold Thady in a battle uphill probably isn't the best recipe but it's great he put his head down and got the job done. He's a good solid, little horse - Neil Mulholland, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Had three starts for Nicky Henderson, finishing with second to an impressive winner in C&D maiden (good to soft) and he just holds third-placed Swift Jet on that result; forgiven his 2m5f run for new connections last month and this test should suit on handicap debut.

💬 Comment: 2l behind Doctor Midas in a maiden over C&D; interesting back up in trip on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Almost a year out before switching to hurdles this season from bumpers; showed significant ability first two attempts, latterly when 2l behind Doctor Midas over C&D (good to soft; unraced on firmer) and it was probably best to forgive him at 33-1 over 2m4f for latest outing; interesting back up in trip on handicap debut.

💬 Comment: Third of five when stepped up to 2m7f at Bangor last time did not prove his stamina
🔦 Spotlight: 2-14 hurdling, with the first win at this track and the second at Worcester (2m4f) last June; in reasonable form lately but his third of five when stepped up to 2m7f at Bangor last time did not prove his stamina.
Horse quote: 2023-03-02 at Ludlow (16f): "That was fairly straightforward and it was a lovely ride by Jay [Tidball], he knows the horse very well. It's all coming together for Thankyourluckystar now, he's had a few issues with his feet in the past and he's got his confidence and built from there. It was nice ground there and it helped him, I'd say he'll be better when he goes over fences - Alastair Ralph, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: While better is likely today than on latest start, others are still more persuasive
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who is 8-37 over hurdles, the latest win at Bangor in October; pulled up next time and absent four months before last month's 25l defeat when 80-1 over 2m5f, which was an inadequate trip and he probably needed the run; while better is likely today, others are still more persuasive.
Horse quote: 2021-05-06 at Worcester (23f): "Alastair Ralph's done a good job with Butler's Brief and his horses run well around here. He likes the track and better ground. It's nice that he's won again - Nick Scholfield, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made a step back in the right direction but others have more solid claims
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up over 2m5f/3m2f when moving into handicaps late last year; third in maiden over an extended 2m5f at Market Rasen last month was a step back in the right direction but others have more solid claims; tried cheekpieces then visor for last two starts.
