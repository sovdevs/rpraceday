🔦 Spotlight: Still 7lb higher than when gaining his sole success at Yarmouth (1m, good to firm) last September, but has only been beaten a neck the last twice, the first of those over C&D and the latest off this mark at Bath (1m2f, good to firm) on Sunday; should go well again with a visor replacing cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran with credit when fourth on his return from 673 days off at Newcastle last month
🔦 Spotlight: 1m1f turf winner for Joesph O'Brien as a 3yo who was returning from 673 days off when fourth of 11 on AW debut at Newcastle (1m2f, Tapeta) five weeks ago (winner went in again next time); no surprise if he figures with the run under his belt.
Horse quote: 2022-09-13 at Punchestown (9f): "Saturn Five is tough and hardy, he's a big horse and still green. There should be a lot of improvement in him. Hopefully he is one for next year and that trip is probably his minimum - Brendan Powell, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Makes handicap/AW debut after six months off; sire has a good record here; hood on
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the second attempt at Beverley (1m2f, good) last September, but appeared to get bogged down in the soft ground at Nottingham (1m) the following month; makes his handicap/AW debut after six months off in a first-time hood; sire has a good record here and market confidence should be heeded.

🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winner on turf at Yarmouth (1m2f/11.5f) for Rae Guest and not beaten far on her stable debut/return at Leicester (1m4f, good to firm; first-time tongue-tie) this month; out of the frame in four starts on the AW, though, which does pose a question.
Horse quote: 2023-08-10 at Yarmouth (10f): "I think we'll look for some softer ground for Afloat next time as it was good to soft when we declared but now it's good to firm. We had to run as she was 2lb well in - Rae Guest, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked to need his Newcastle return a fortnight ago; respected with the run under his belt
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins on the AW, the latest when making just about all at Southwell (1m3f, Tapeta) in March last year; ran as though his first start in over a year was needed when fourth of seven at Newcastle (1m2f, Tapeta) a fortnight ago; respected with the outing under his belt, especially if again allowed his own way.

🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in both starts since chasing home a 📈 progressive rival from 1lb higher at Kempton (1m4f, Polytrack) in December, albeit the race wasn't run to suit at Wolverhampton last time; interesting off this mark with a tongue-tie given a go.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3lb below last winning mark and chased home a couple of thriving rivals last time
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins for Marco Botti came on the AW including off 3lb higher at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) early last year; better efforts in his last two starts for this yard, as when third of eight behind a couple of thriving rivals at the same track (8.6f) last time; races off the same mark.
Horse quote: 2024-02-12 at Wolverhampton (AW) (9.5f): "Caelan is still a big, raw horse. He won first-time out but ended up being quite immature and he was running a bit free but today he's done everything the right way round, although he wasn't doing a tap in front. He's taken well to all-weather surfaces but I don't see why he won't be just as effective on the grass - Hollie Doyle, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
