🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point and 2m3f maiden winner; needs to settle but very much one to note on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: £150,000 buy in February 2023 after winning an Irish maiden point; tailed off on rules debut that December (6-5 favourite) but won a Warwick maiden (2m3f, good; 8-1) last April; settling him early on was an issue in the latter, and he probably can't afford a repeat of that over this longer trip, but he otherwise scored in promising style and it will be no surprise if he soon turns out to be a lot better than his opening mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd in six of 11 hurdle races but made all in dominant fashion over C&D eight weeks ago
🔦 Spotlight: Usually ridden by Olive Nicholls, making the running this season; runner-up in six of his 11 hurdle races but, with third-time cheekpieces, he was off the mark in dominant fashion in six-runner novice handicap over C&D eight weeks ago; 7lb rise demands more in this stronger race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third in a valuable race at Sandown (2m7f, good to soft) last February off today's mark
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 9yo who's had mixed form and no win in handicaps, but he was third in a valuable race at Sandown (2m7f, good to soft) last February off today's mark; having another go at fences may explain a lesser show two months ago on his only appearance since.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice ran out but plenty of ability; up in trip; could be interesting on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Still competitive when running out two from home at Leicester (2m4f) in November and he did exactly the same thing at Windsor (2m) four weeks later; confirmed he has plenty of ability when third at Doncaster (2m, again good to soft) three weeks ago, covered up as he made his way from rear, and there was encouragement for longer trips in that performance; could be interesting on this handicap debut if he keeps to the straight and narrow.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 in handicap hurdles but mostly not far away at the finish and she was placed at Wincanton (2m5f, good) and Fakenham (2m4f, good) on last two outings; those races are clearly the furthest she's been and she did much her best work late on, so this new trip brings some hope.

🔦 Spotlight: Had to wait over two years for his second win but when it came at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) three weeks ago it was by a huge margin; back up 8lb and that's the furthest he's been, but now the possibility arises that he'll be interesting at this trip as well.
