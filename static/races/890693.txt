🔦 Spotlight: Dam bred winners at 5f-1m, including on Tapeta; the outsider of three on C&D debut when showing signs of inexperience but also ability despite being well held by an impressive newcomer (second well beaten since); capable of stepping up on that, especially given experience of the surface; holds sales-race entries later.
