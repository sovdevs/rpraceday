🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark (sixth attempt) with a clearcut win at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft) in December and she's finished runner-up in both starts since; rallied well when only beaten 2l on the step up to 3m at Southwell (good) last Tuesday and she should have more to offer at staying trips; 🔥 big player.

💬 Comment: Turned things around with win on stable debut here in November; respected back up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French 6yo; generally struggled in seven runs for Syd Hosie (including four non-completions), but she turned things around for 🆕 new yard with 22-1 win here (2m3f, good to firm) in November; this is a different test after another break but she flew home from an unpromising position last time and remains feasibly treated off only 2lb higher; respected back up in trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Two 2m wins (AW) on the Flat and she made it sixth-time lucky over hurdles when landing a seller at Exeter (2m2f, good; 14-1) three weeks ago; 4lb higher back in a handicap but she still has potential over hurdles and looks interesting on this switch to a staying trip.
