🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flourishing now, winning 4 of last 5; up 5lb in a higher grade but still a 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: He's got his act together this winter and is making giant strides, winning four of his last five starts; far too strong for the opposition at Chelmsford 12 days ago (6f; Class 6) and a 5lb rise seems fair, even allowing for that race setting up nicely for him; good chance despite stepping ⬆️ up in class.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came from the clouds to take 4th at Newcastle last time; 6f a query; slowly away this year
🔦 Spotlight: Came from a poor position to take fourth at Newcastle 12 days ago (5f); in theory the extra furlong should suit but his record over 6f is unconvincing and two slow starts this year also temper enthusiasm slightly; no surprise were he to win but there are risks.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hold-up performer who starts out for a 🆕 new yard on a dangerous mark; one to consider
🔦 Spotlight: Well treated now and three Newcastle runs to end 2024 didn't see him to best effect; should find this being run to suit and he's interesting on first run for a 🆕 new yard (same owner).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good 3rd on return last month but stopped quickly last time; 6f a major query
🔦 Spotlight: Into the veteran stage but he retains enthusiasm and ran well when a close third at Newcastle on last month's return to action (5f); stopped quickly back there 12 days ago and today's trip is a major query.
