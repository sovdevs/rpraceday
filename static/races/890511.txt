🔦 Spotlight: Ended 2024 with two good efforts on slow ground (2m4f/2m) but looked out of sorts when pulled up on both outings this year; may not be ideally suited by the much quicker ground here, and others have much less to prove.
Horse quote: 2023-12-17 at Southwell (16f): "Graham and Alison [Jelley, owners] have been supremely patient with Tommie Gun. He had loads of sinus troubles and it wasn't an easy problem to fix. He basically always had a runny nose but now they've fixed that, so hopefully he can repay them with all that support he's been given. He's done a lot of jumping and had been a little bit clumsy at home. It was nice to come here over the fixed brush hurdles as it helped him jump neatly and accurately - Sam Twiston-Davies, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten about 25l in both handicaps but may yet have a bigger run in him
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten about 25l in both handicaps, latterly when upped to 2m3f at Catterick (good) last month; needs to improve here but has dropped another 4lb since last time and Ben Smith claims 7lb today; could have a say.
