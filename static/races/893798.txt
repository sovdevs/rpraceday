🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not easy to win with but reliable, in-form and goes well at the track; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Modest strike-rate but he's a reliable sprinter and he did manage to win a competitive Chelmsford event on Good Friday (5f); solid third at Goodwood 16 days ago (finished in front of Diamond Dreamer) and he's yet to run a poor race at this track; should be involved.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dangerous mark on his best form but he's looked temperamental in two runs this year
🔦 Spotlight: Capable of useful form on his day and he won at York last summer off a 3lb higher mark; ✂️ gelded over the winter but it hasn't helped his temperament judged on his two racecourse appearances this year; no surprise to see him fare better in what should be a well run race but there are risks attached for now.
Horse quote: 2023-09-10 at York (6f): "The Coffee Pod was third in the Hornblower last time to a couple of good horses, but we thought this would suit him. Richard says he wants 7f, maybe a mile eventually, so we might step him up next time. We've got the job done and hopefully go on from there - Tim Palin, racing director of Middleham Park Racing, owners."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Several excuses at Lingfield (5f, good to firm) 9 days ago; in good form on AW beforehand
🔦 Spotlight: In good form on AW this year, including when fourth to Nogo's Dream at Chelmsford on Good Friday when poorly drawn; sent off co-favourite for his return to turf at Lingfield nine days ago but had a poor draw, got stuck out in the middle of the track and was hampered as well so that run is not the one to judge him on; high on the list.
Horse quote: 2025-02-24 at Wolverhampton (AW) (5f): "I knew they were going to go pretty hard but I was able to sit a little bit further forward than I did last time. Maharajas Express is quite a keen horse but he relaxed nice enough halfway and it took a while to really hit top gear today. I got a bit of luck up the straight but he's very tough and there's more improvement in him - David Probert, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-06-13 at Nottingham (6f): "That was a bit of a surprise. We thought Lipsink needed that badly today which he probably did so he's going to come on a lot. He's a nice horse. He's in here again next week and we'll probably bring him back - Mick Appleby, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two 5f wins last summer; on winning mark; should fare better having had a run last month
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who won twice over 5f last summer; showed pace but dropped away to finish tenth of 11 on his Epsom reappearance four weeks ago; better expected here but unlikely to get an easy time of things up front.
