🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won here for Nigel Hawke; low mark; back after wind op with headgear tried; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 2m1f juvenile event here (2m1f, soft) in December 2023 when with Nigel Hawke; mixed form since but quite a promising run when fourth at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft) on stable debut in February; seems to stay 2m4f and interesting back after a wind op on a career-low mark with cheekpieces tried.
Horse quote: 2023-11-16 at Sedgefield (17f): "Feach Amach had a promising run at Fontwell in August but things didn't go the way we hoped last time. However, she was fit and well today and Lorcan gave her a fantastic ride. The other horse jinked but I think she still would have got there - Paul Willis, owner."
