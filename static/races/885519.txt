💬 Comment: 📈 progressive and can gain compensation for being demoted to second on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: 4yo with 📈 progressive RPRs; demoted having wandered around under pressure when narrowly first past the post on his 1m4f Southwell handicap debut three weeks ago; that is solid form and he can make light of a 3lb nudge with further improvement on the cards.

🔦 Spotlight: Gained his first win in handicaps over 1m4f at Lingfield last month and a tactical race over 1m2f may not have suited when only 7l third under a penalty back there six days later; this test should be more suitable.

💬 Comment: Well held in handicap on back of C&D novice win but still early days; cheekpieces go on
🔦 Spotlight: Nicely bred colt whose turf form (1m/1m2f) has worked out well; comfortably justified favouritism in C&D novice on yard debut last month but weakened quickly on 1m2f course handicap debut just nine days later; 5lb lower now and no surprise were he to get back on the up in cheekpieces.

💬 Comment: 1m4f winner at Lingfield last month and excuses when only 7l third over 1m2f there since
🔦 Spotlight: Gained his first win in handicaps over 1m4f at Lingfield last month and a tactical race over 1m2f may not have suited when only 7l third under a penalty back there six days later; this test should be more suitable.

💬 Comment: Well held in handicap on back of C&D novice win but still early days; cheekpieces go on
🔦 Spotlight: Nicely bred colt whose turf form (1m/1m2f) has worked out well; comfortably justified favouritism in C&D novice on yard debut last month but weakened quickly on 1m2f course handicap debut just nine days later; 5lb lower now and no surprise were he to get back on the up in cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Useful 1m2f Flat performer, including a course handicap win, but hasn't got anywhere near translating that ability to hurdles in three runs this winter; it remains to be seen whether a return to the Flat sparks a revival with a hood and tongue-tie combined.
