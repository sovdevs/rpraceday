💬 Comment: Steady run to justify 4-6 favouritism at Lingfield (1m2f, AW) eight days ago; 6lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Five races; shaped well on handicap debut at Wolverhampton (8.6f) last month and produced a strong, steady run to justify 4-6 favouritism in seven-runner handicap at Lingfield (1m2f, AW) eight days ago; he's one of only two who have runs this season and his 6lb penalty far from rules him out.

💬 Comment: 10-11, won Chelmsford novice (1m2f, AW) in December by 4l, moving further clear at line
🔦 Spotlight: Close on debut at Brighton (1m, good to soft) in October; ran in two AW races later last year, ending as 4l winner of a novice when 10-11 at Chelmsford (1m2f) in December; well on top that day and was moving further clear at the line, so he brings promise under 5lb claimer on this handicap debut.
