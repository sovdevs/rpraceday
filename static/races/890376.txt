🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Allowed his own way over C&D last Tuesday and a penalty demands more but is respected
🔦 Spotlight: Only seen twice last year, having been trained in Ireland previously, but has enjoyed a clear run at it this season and proved better than ever; was allowed his own way over C&D last Tuesday and a penalty demands more but he's obviously respected.
Horse quote: 2023-09-06 at Gowran Park (8f): "I didn't use my whip much as I was fairly confident Partisan Hero was doing enough the whole way up the straight. His last furlong was probably his best so he will be able to go up in trip. There should be improvement in him - Jake Coen, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "We didn't go very quick. Paris Lights has been threatening to run well and has been disappointing but Paul [Midgley, trainer] has got him in a good place now and hopefully he can build on this - David Nolan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2022-09-15 at Ayr (7f): "I think the world of Chuzzlewit. He relaxed lovely today but he was still green and backward and there is more to come. He shows speed at home but he'll have no problem staying a mile next year. He won't run again until next year, he'll keep progressing and I don't know how good he could be - Kevin Ryan, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-06-18 at Doncaster (8f): "That went very smoothly. Last time Power Of Gold's race was run before the stalls opened as he got himself a bit worked up, hence the red hood today which made a big difference to conserving his energy - Ross Coakley, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Finished third in a division of this race last spring, off 2lb lower, before going on to win twice at his beloved Hamilton; lost his way in cheekpieces latterly and would have preferred some rain.
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Hamilton (8.5f): "We'll aim to go back to the track as Arkenstaar has never run a bad race there. I thought he showed a great attitude because he was being attacked from both sides. My biggest concern when speaking to Connor [Beasley, jockey] before was that there didn't look like there'd be any pace on, and he grinds it out more than anything. I'm really pleased with him, though - Michael Dods, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Been running over further in a hood; good chance he over-races again with the headgear off
🔦 Spotlight: Has been running over further in a hood; pulled away his chances back on turf last time and is better than that but there's every chance he over-races again with the headgear removed.

💬 Comment: Last summer's C&D win came off a 10lb lower mark and he's not improving at his age
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who was in good form round Newcastle in the winter; last summer's C&D win came off a 10lb lower mark and he's not improving at his age, so looks to have a difficult task back from a few months off.
Horse quote: 2022-08-07 at Haydock (10f): "This was a stronger race than Jewel Maker won at Carlisle and he picked them up nicely. He's a horse who needs cover early on as he can be a bit keen  - Sean Kirrane, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hard to believe he's up to this sort of mark now and this trip is a bare minimum anyway
🔦 Spotlight: Been around a bit and has regressed sharply over hurdles in recent times; it's hard to believe he's up to this sort of mark on the Flat now and this trip is a bare minimum anyway.
Horse quote: 2023-01-13 at Huntingdon (16f): "Perseus Way is a very nice horse and I'm pleased that he has done it well today. His jumping is getting better all the time, but it needs to. He is getting slicker and quicker and he is starting to enjoy his racing. It was a good run in defeat at Chepstow last time and I felt that Chepstow was probably soft enough for him. We rode him too far back that day and that is why we rode him handier today. I don't think he is good enough to run in the Triumph but I think he could have a strong chance in the handicap - Gary Moore, trainer."
