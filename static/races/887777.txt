🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful winning hurdler who retains potential but the long absence is an obvious concern
🔦 Spotlight: Posted a smart RPR in winning a 2m7f maiden hurdle on soft ground at Chepstow in March 2023 but off since; this shorter trip shouldn't count against him on chase debut when he was quick enough to win a bumper, but the absence is an obvious cause for concern.

🔦 Spotlight: Capable hurdler, though not in Butch's class; only had two runs over fences, returning to this discipline when second in a small-field handicap at Ayr last time (2m4f, soft); relying on the favourite being off his game.

💬 Comment: Tailed off in a match on his chase debut and belated return at Haydock two months ago
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who is having only his sixth run under rules; tailed off in a match on his chase debut and belated return at Haydock two months ago; 2m would have been on the sharp side given that he won his maiden hurdle over nearly 3m, but even this could be an insufficient test.
