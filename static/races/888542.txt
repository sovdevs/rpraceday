🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 8lb rise for Newcastle win (2m1f) looks stiff; just the one go over this far to date.
🔦 Spotlight: Wayward late but held on at Newcastle latest (2m1f, good to soft; first pair well clear); 8lb rise looks stiff, but pulled up effort last autumn ought not be all he has to offer over today's sort of trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Value for closer than a near-3l second at Catterick latest (2m3.5f, soft), considering interference from a loose horse; a dryout wouldn't necessarily be appreciated (beaten 54l on sole start on good), and back up 2lb.

💬 Comment: A dryout would require her to run above any previous form effort on good or faster.
🔦 Spotlight: Encouraging signs initially following wind surgery, but a 37l defeat as beaten favourite at Wincanton latest (2m4f, good to soft) takes some forgiving; twice placed in four starts on sound surfaces (one a bumper here) without posting a higher RPR than 83 in any of them.
