🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: More rain the better as the ground was heavy when winning a Punchestown maiden
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins on heavy ground, over 1m2f on the Flat and last time reeling in one of Willie Mullins' lesser lights in a Punchestown maiden over an extended 2m3f; as that day, she's a 4yo filly getting the allowances.
