🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Extended 2m3f when winning easily at Bangor; 🔥 big player if he can see out this trip
🔦 Spotlight: 2-4 in handicaps; beaten a long way in the two defeats but appeared sweetened up by the new cheekpieces when coasting home in front at Bangor (extended 2m3f, good) nine days ago and a 7lb rise could have been worse; the big question mark hangs over today's much longer trip, but he's clearly a strong contender if he can see it out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won both her races since raised in distance and is looking 📈 progressive
🔦 Spotlight: Has won both her races since raised in distance, the first over C&D and then beating the one other finisher at Wincanton (again on good ground); raised another 4lb but should be on the scene.
Horse quote: 2025-03-31 at Wincanton (24.5f): "La Dolce Dolly is very willing and we're really happy with her. She might have one more run at Plumpton on Easter Monday and we're hoping she'll make up into a good staying chaser next season. She doesn't want the ground too soft - Andy Irvine, trainer, talking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Odds-on winner at Fontwell in a bumper on soft and a maiden on good; chasing this season (after wind surgery) and his latest effort was much the best of those; however, he returns to hurdles over a trip that could stretch him (unraced beyond an extended 2m4f).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up the last twice but it's still quite early days and his yard is bang in form
🔦 Spotlight: Second in a maiden here (2m4f) in December, since which he's been pulled up in a maiden at Cheltenham and the EBF Final (handicap) at Sandown; doesn't look on that good a mark but it's still quite early days and his yard is bang in form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor in two runs after an absence but getting away from soft ground will be preferable
🔦 Spotlight: Strike-rate of 5-18 as a hurdler but he's a 10yo now and has shown little in two runs (both over 3m) following a long absence; on the plus side, getting away from soft ground will be preferable.
Horse quote: 2023-02-18 at Wincanton (21.5f): "Press Your Luck won over fences at Chepstow in October but then lost his bottle. He went to Wetherby and he didn't want to know; he whipped round at the start. His jumping was appalling next time at Exeter and, for whatever reason, the horse got his confidence back today and loved that. He'll stay over hurdles for the time being and I think he enjoyed the small field. He's a good horse when things go right - Chris Gordon, trainer."
