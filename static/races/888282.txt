🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Market Rasen (2m4f, good) and Wincanton (2m4f, heavy) on his last two outings
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 over hurdles but he's 2-6 over fences after winning from the front at Market Rasen (2m4f, good) in October and Wincanton (2m4f, heavy) in January on his last two outings; back up another 5lb but he's been on an upward curve again and stands alone in that respect in this line-up.

🔦 Spotlight: 2m4f Plumpton hurdles winner for previous stable last March; this season has not gone that well over fences, despite some minor honours and a falling mark, so others bring more pressing claims; 7lb claimer is recruited.

💬 Comment: Scored by 16l here (2m3f, soft; 5 ran) on New Year's Day; two major backward steps since
🔦 Spotlight: Appeared to take his form to a whole new level when making all to score by 16l in five-runner race here (2m3f, soft) on New Year's Day, his sixth chase success, but there have been two major backward steps since (here and at Taunton); 5lb higher than for that most recent win.
