🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up in first two handicaps (hurdle/chase); leap of faith needed to support him here
🔦 Spotlight: Awarded Chepstow maiden hurdle (2m3f, heavy) in January last year but pulled up in two subsequent 2m7f handicaps, latterly on last month's seasonal/chase debut; still 🔍 unexposed under rules but it takes a leap of faith to support him here; sports first-time cheekpieces.
