🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won in big field at Uttoxeter latest and this in-form 10yo could play another leading role
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from a break with a good third at Musselburgh (3m, good to soft) in February then won in a big field at Uttoxeter (2m7f, good to soft); the drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus but this in-form 10yo is just 4lb higher than last time and could play another leading role.
Horse quote: 2025-03-15 at Uttoxeter (23.5f): "Red Risk was brilliant, wasn't he? His last run at Musselburgh was very good, and I just thought off his mark of 137 he'd have a little chance. I wasn't quite sure he'd be good enough to win, but we rode him to run well and ended up nicking the lot. Joyeux Machin was all over us jumping the second last and then he basically stopped. We've come with a wet sail after the last and done him on the line - Harry Cobden, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way in the Martin Pipe when back from an absence; possible player
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 4-7 over hurdles when winning on her first two handicap starts in winter 2023-24 (2m4f/2m7f, soft); ran well for a long way on her first outing since in the Martin Pipe at Cheltenham (2m4f, good to soft) last month and she could show the benefit of that outing today; cheekpieces go on.
Horse quote: 2021-11-08 at Carlisle (17f): "We thought a lot of Nurse Susan at home but you just never know going to the track for the first time. She's something a bit special, hopefully. She's a proper National Hunt mare, who's only four, and whatever she does this year will be a bonus - Harry Skelton, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for a long way in the Martin Pipe when back from an absence; possible player
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 4-7 over hurdles when winning on her first two handicap starts in winter 2023-24 (2m4f/2m7f, soft); ran well for a long way on her first outing since in the Martin Pipe at Cheltenham (2m4f, good to soft) last month and she could show the benefit of that outing today; cheekpieces go on.
Horse quote: 2021-11-08 at Carlisle (17f): "We thought a lot of Nurse Susan at home but you just never know going to the track for the first time. She's something a bit special, hopefully. She's a proper National Hunt mare, who's only four, and whatever she does this year will be a bonus - Harry Skelton, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair fifth in the Morebattle last time and this step back up in trip is worth a go
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't kicked on since winning on his reappearance at Hexham (2m, good) last October; however, he was a fair fifth in the Morebattle at Kelso (2m, good to soft) last month and this step back up in trip is worth a go; has dropped below his last winning mark and is not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2023-12-11 at Ayr (16f): "His hurdling was good and Florida Dreams got the job done, but I don't think for a second he was liking the ground. He wasn't spectacular, but he's looking like he wants two and a half miles on better ground. Before we ran him over hurdles we half thought we'd give him a couple of runs and then head to the Formby (formerly the Tolworth) at Aintree, but he probably doesn't want winter ground. We'll see how he is in the next couple of weeks and make a plan - Nicky Richards, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m4f novice here in December 2023 and showed strong form in March-June 2024 after moving into handicaps; absent since but he has potential off this mark if retaining his previous promise; the betting may guide.
Horse quote: 2024-03-23 at Newbury (19f): "I was worried mid-race we'd brought I Love My Baie back in trip too much. He's a three miler, but bombed last time, although it wasn't the trip - he just didn't run well. We've given him time to get over that and he's quite a nice horse; he was third in a Listed race at Haydock in November - Anthony Bromley, racing manager for Simon Munir and Isaac Souede."

🔦 Spotlight: Second-season hurdler who improved for the step up in trip earlier in the season and won at Wincanton (3m, good to soft) in January; however, two lesser runs have followed (2m7f, good to soft) and he needs to raise his game in a first-time tongue-tie.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Wincanton (24.5f): "We thought we'd get a lead today and we also changed the bit that Phantomofthepoints ran in at Chepstow. Jack (Tudor) always thought he was doing enough on the run-in. David Pipe, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-01-01 at Musselburgh (20f): "I thought Benson was maybe beaten but he just got there. He's been called a lot of names in the past but that's twice now he's really produced the goods in this race. We've won this about five or six times in total now, so it's been a good contest for us. He'll go to the Morebattle again now, whether he runs before then I don't know - Sandy Thomson, trainer."
