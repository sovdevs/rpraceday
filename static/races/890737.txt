🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good run at Cork gives her strong claims here, let down by her jumping at Naas
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point/maiden hurdle winner; creditable fifth behind Golden Ace in the Mares' Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham a year ago; solid run behind the useful Spindleberry (2-2 over fences) on chase debut at Cork in December, a late mistake proving costly; jumped poorly when a disappointing second-favourite at Naas; should feature with an error-free round.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner in 2022, has had training problems, off since maiden hurdle win 16 months ago
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner for Colin Bowe at Portrush in October 2022; after a year off, flopped when odds-on favourite for a bumper at Fairyhouse; redeemed himself when beating a useful sort in Down Royal maiden hurdle win the following month; seems to have had training issues but chance has to be take seriously.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Highly tried as a novice hurdler last season, has failed to make much impact as a chaser
🔦 Spotlight: Point/bumper winner; won a maiden hurdle at Punchestown last season before struggling in two Grade 1s; soundly beaten in fourth on chase debut at Cork (Majestic Force second); jumped poorly at Navan; outsider of three for stable in a stronger race at Punchestown; has become disappointing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Decent form in points, tailed off when set a tough task on chase debut at Leopardstown
🔦 Spotlight: Modest form in maiden hurdles, rated 102; profited from a switch to Richie Rath for this season's point-to-point campaign, two wins and two seconds from four starts; tailed off when tried in good company at Leopardstown for his first chase start.
