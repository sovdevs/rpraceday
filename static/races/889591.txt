💬 Comment: Up 9lb for exploiting a soft lead last time but Jack Dace's claim takes care of 7lb
🔦 Spotlight: Not many 6f handicaps are won by more than 5l but that was the case at Chelmsford where he made the most of a soft lead; this might not pan out so favourably but he's on his game right now and Jack Dace's claim assists with the 9lb rise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stall 1 might not be ideal for one who does have a tendency to miss the break
🔦 Spotlight: Exposed 8yo but remains very capable and a slow start was no help when behind Charlie Mason last time at Southwell (6f); does have a tendency to miss the kick (though not always) and that would spell danger from stall one; 6lb higher when a close third in this last year.
