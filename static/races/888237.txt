💬 Comment: Has enjoyed a consistent first season over fences and could settle better now in a hood
🔦 Spotlight: He's enjoyed a consistent first season over fences, bumping into a 📈 progressive winner when second here (2m4f, good) in December and racing freely in front when 16l second at Musselburgh (2m4f, good to soft) latest; could settle better in a first-time hood today and he's firmly in calculations.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-4 in chases and there are doubts about him in this sphere, but he's well handicapped on hurdle form and took a step in the right direction when fourth over fences here in December (2m4f, good; Asta La Pasta second); may be able to build on that latest performance; possible player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Up in grade today but this 📈 progressive 6yo is 3-6 over fences and in with a chance
🔦 Spotlight: Having weakened over 2m4f in December he was suited by the drop back in trip when narrowly making all at Wincanton (2m, good to soft) nine days ago; up in grade and back up in distance today but it's possible the trip will be within range and this 📈 progressive 6yo is 3-6 over fences; chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran out in last 2 chases but plenty of promise among recalcitrance; capable of going well
🔦 Spotlight: Comes with risks attached now back over fences as he can make mistakes and he ran out on his last two chase starts in the autumn; however, there was plenty of promise among the recalcitrance and he's been in pretty good form over hurdles this winter; contender if completing the course.
