🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 2 Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton (1m7f, heavy) last February and has been suited by this sort of trip with wins on his last two outings, latest at Windsor (2m4f, soft); the half-length runner-up Salver is 3lb better off today but this highly admirable 8yo will be a tough nut to crack.
