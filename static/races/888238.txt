🔦 Spotlight: Solid performer whose form figures in completed starts read 11211332; switched to fences for the last three of those, going down by only a neck at Taunton (2m7f, soft) last time; a 3lb nudge shouldn't prevent another prominent showing.

🔦 Spotlight: This 11yo has been an infrequent chase winner over the years but he did strike in quick succession at Huntingdon (2m7f, good) and Leicester (2m6f, good to soft) in November; not disgraced back from a break at Carlisle (3m, good to soft) last month and he may come on for that run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well handicapped but recent efforts not obviously encouraging
🔦 Spotlight: No need to go too far back to unearth form on which he's well handicapped but his last two efforts haven't been obviously encouraging, finishing well behind the reopposing Dibble Decker at Huntingdon only 13 days ago.
