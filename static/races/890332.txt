🔦 Spotlight: Made a flying start to his 3yo/handicap career, winning 5f events at Wolverhampton and Southwell (twice); went a bit cold afterwards but he was ✂️ gelded last July and returned to action with a good second at Wolverhampton in November; hasn't built on that but he's down in the weights and this is an ease in grade; more to prove on turf.
