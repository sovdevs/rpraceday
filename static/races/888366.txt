💬 Comment: Defied an absence at Haydock last month and well worth another go at this sort of trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Ayr (2m4f, good) last March and returned from absence to score at Haydock (2m4f, good to soft) last month; yet to win beyond an extended 2m4f but stamina didn't look an issue over an extended 2m7f on soft ground at Kelso last January and this course winner could play another leading role.
