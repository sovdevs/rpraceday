🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very respectable eighth in C&D Triumph last month; major player in this easier race
🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably won 20-runner Punchestown maiden (2m, yielding to soft) on stable debut in December; spoiled chance by racing far too freely in Leopardstown Grade 1 in February but, with a hood fitted, was very respectable eighth over C&D in last month's Triumph (good to soft); major player in this easier race, assuming the hood continues to aid.
Horse quote: 2024-12-31 at Punchestown (16.5f): "Sainte Lucie looks one out of the top drawer. I love the way she went through that ground. I imagine we will be going to the top events with her - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 2-5 over hurdles; had to dig deep to justify skinny odds at Newcastle (2m1f, good) last month, but that form was recently very well advertised by the clear runner-up; can make a bold bid from the front on handicap debut.
Horse quote: 2024-12-29 at Doncaster (16.5f): "Even if David's [Pipe] horse stood up, we were booked for second clearly and I would have been thrilled with Matwana. She ran a fantastic race and I think that's her best performance so far - Harry Derham, trainer."

💬 Comment: Managed only eighth on recent handicap debut; may benefit from this drop back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably won three-runner Huntingdon maiden (2m, soft) on stable debut in December but is yet to build on that performance, managing only eighth in valuable novices' handicap at Newbury (2m4f, good) last month; may benefit from today's drop back in trip but needs to up her game.
Horse quote: 2024-12-08 at Huntingdon (16f): "We expected Clotilda to win and we'll go to Taunton on the 30th either for a juvenile hurdle or a fillies' race. She should give her owner some good fun through the winter. She'll gallop all day, loves the mud and she'll get further as well. She'd been jumping fences and doing all sorts before we got her, so we had to get her jumping a bit sharper. She'll be better in a race where they go flat out and she can follow them rather than lead as well - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Bettered low-key British debut when winning quite stylishly at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) last month and was running a big race before last-flight fall at Kempton (2m, good) nine days later; may still be quite harshly handicapped on her French form but Jay Tidball claims a useful 5lb.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in low-grade Flat handicaps in Ireland last summer and has taken pretty well to hurdling for Dan Skelton, albeit she was very fortunate to win at Doncaster last month (2m, good; clear leader fell at last flight, hampering the horse in second); needs to improve to make winning handicap debut from 9lb out of the weights but Heidi Palin's 7lb claim is helpful.
