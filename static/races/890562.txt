🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to win over fences but has been running well in defeat; jumps soundly
🔦 Spotlight: Highly tried over hurdles after winning her maiden; it's been a solid start over fences and the positively-ridden winner got away from her last time at Thurles (2m2f, good to yielding; prefers it softer); jumps well enough to handle this track and has every chance.
Horse quote: 2024-02-24 at Fairyhouse (16f): "I'm delighted with that. Theatre Native ran very keen there all the way and when she learns to settle, obviously that will help her again. It was lovely to see her still finish out the race as well. She did a lovely piece of work about ten days ago, so that gave us some encouragement. I think the key is to try and get her to settle more. She's got an engine and I'm delighted she's done that - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

💬 Comment: Up in grade off 3lb higher but she's likeable and still quite 🔍 unexposed at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't had that many runs over this sort of trip and she stayed on best for a hard-fought win at Leicester last time (2m4f, good to soft); up in grade off 3lb higher but she's likeable.
