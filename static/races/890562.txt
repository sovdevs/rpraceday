🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to win over fences but has been running well in defeat; jumps soundly
🔦 Spotlight: Highly tried over hurdles after winning her maiden; it's been a solid start over fences and the positively-ridden winner got away from her last time at Thurles (2m2f, good to yielding; prefers it softer); jumps well enough to handle this track and has every chance.
Horse quote: 2024-02-24 at Fairyhouse (16f): "I'm delighted with that. Theatre Native ran very keen there all the way and when she learns to settle, obviously that will help her again. It was lovely to see her still finish out the race as well. She did a lovely piece of work about ten days ago, so that gave us some encouragement. I think the key is to try and get her to settle more. She's got an engine and I'm delighted she's done that - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has been a tad disappointing since her Kempton win and cheekpieces are now added
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time hurdle winner and prevailed narrowly in a 2m4f mares' handicap chase at Kempton in November (good); hasn't really threatened to go in again since then and cheekpieces are added to the tongue-tie tried last time.
Horse quote: 2024-11-11 at Kempton (20.5f): "Ilovethenightlife is a gorgeous-looking mare and she probably hasn't won enough races. The horses couldn't be in any better form so it's time to run them now. I did say that to Joe because, for goodness' sake, it won't always last like this - Colin Tizzard."
