🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner, up 12lb for easy win on h'cap debut, 🔍 unexposed, could be more to come
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner; off the mark over hurdles on handicap debut at Punchestown (3m1f, heavy) in February when well backed; up 12lb for that but he did it easily and he's 🔍 unexposed; could be more to come.
Horse quote: 2025-02-24 at Punchestown (25f): "Rokathir travelled and jumped great. He fell the last day here (over fences) when I still though I had half a a chance and the winner went on and won again at Fairyhouse. He had a nice weight and coped with the ground well. He was a bit quirky when he first came but the penny is beginning to drop now. Darragh O'Keefe, jockey talking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: In-form mare, up 16lb for last two runs, moves up in grade, chance if handles the ground
🔦 Spotlight: In-form mare has improved for handicaps; won her first one over C&D (good) by 20l off 84 last month; beaten a neck in follow up bid at Navan (3m, good to yielding) off 13lb higher seventeen days ago; up another 3lb in a tougher race and likely very different ground now; chance if she handles conditions.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner, won off 6lb lower at Listowel in September, may be on a tough mark
🔦 Spotlight: Course winner last won at Listowel in September; last sighted finishing a remote second in a Limerick handicap chase in December; remains 6lb above last win; soft ground fine but may be on a tough mark back over hurdles.
Horse quote: 2024-09-25 at Listowel (24f): "Donkey Years has been a great servant and is so much better handicapped over hurdles, so it's great to get one with him. He had promised a couple of times and it's great to have him back with a bit of sparkle. I would love to have another crack at the Munster National - Eric McNamara, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: H'cap debut winner over 3m, didn't follow up at 2m4f, back up in trip now, could rebound
🔦 Spotlight: Won his handicap debut in fine style, beating Duffys Hodey by 8l at Punchestown (2m7f, soft); couldn't follow up off 7lb higher dropped back to 2m4f at Navan, weakening quickly late on; the step back up to 3m is a plus; could bounce back.
Horse quote: 2025-02-20 at Punchestown (23f): "It's my first winner on the track, I've had 24 in point-to-points. Prophet's Corner is a yard favourite and three miles is his thing. Once the ground gets into heavy territory, he's very good on it. He can go the same speed on soft as he can on hard. Darragh [jockey] is my brother, we keep it in-house and keep the costs down - Sean Allen, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Handicap debutante; won a weak 2m7f heavy ground Punchestown maiden in February; outclassed in a Grade 3 novice on latest at Limerick; probably best watched off opening mark of 110.
Horse quote: 2025-02-24 at Punchestown (23f): "We knew stepping up in trip was going to suit Joshua's Daylami. We've done an awful lot of schooling down at Paddy and Jack Kennedy's, although Cian (Cullinan) said once she brushes up her jumping she'll be better again. There's the Shannon Spray Novice Hurdle (mares) in Limerick, we might just go there, or there's a novice handicap in Fairyhouse at Easter - Paul Fahey, trainer, speaking to Racing TV"

💬 Comment: Heavy ground winner off 1lb higher in December 2023, okay chase run latest, rain a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Won on bottomless ground at Fairyhouse in December 2023 off 113 and just 1lb higher now; shaped okay in a Limerick handicap chase after a three month break last month; the forecast rain is a big plus for him; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2023-12-16 at Fairyhouse (24.5f): "Emancipator needs a lead and normally has to have his head landed on the line but I had to go on when I did, he kept his head when the other horse came at him - John Shinnick, rider."

Horse quote: 2024-03-09 at Gowran Park (20f): "Carlas Big Jim probably got an easy lead, but he acts well on that ground. Cal knows him very well and he says he jumps better when he's up there. We might run him next in a qualifier for the Full Circle Series at Cork - Louis Archdeacon, trainer."

💬 Comment: Three-time course winner, won over C&D last March, testing ground ideal, not dismissed
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran is a three-time course winner, the latest coming over C&D on testing ground off 111 in March last year; 2lb higher now and has been mostly out of form since but he'll get his preferred underfoot conditions here; can't be dismissed.
Horse quote: 2023-11-05 at Cork (28f): "I was a little worried after five fences as Sir Bob was getting lazy and I thought he might lose his place, but his jumping just kept him there. Once he was there turning in, I thought we had a great chance. Staying is his job. We were happy with his first run back over hurdles and then a bit disappointed with him on his second run but the distance suited him today. He's an 11-year-old now so it's great to get it. The Troytown will probably come too soon so the Porterstown is more likely his next race and we might try him over longer distances over hurdles somewhere along the line. He's tough and he battled back after the last - Robert Tyner, trainer."

💬 Comment: 4lb below Punchestown hurdles win, best on good ground, watch on return from break
🔦 Spotlight: Is now 4lb lower than when gaining sole hurdles win in a 2m4f Punchestown handicap in October 2023; off since unseating in a handicap chase at Wexford last August; testing ground would be a negative; watch.
Horse quote: 2022-03-31 at Naas (16f): "Irish Envoy was green and babyish and was barely ready for a run. I thought the advantages of running before Punchestown out-weighed the disadvantages. He'll go for the Land Rover now - Liz Doyle, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In form, won at Limerick and third at Naas, probably needs the rain to miss; reserve
🔦 Spotlight: Second reserve; in good form, winning at Limerick in March (22.5f, yielding) and close up behind Cullig off 5lb higher when third at Naas (3m, good to yielding); ⬆️ up in class and may not be as effective on testing ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1-15 over hurdles, 6lb above last win, beaten by Rokathir latest; reserve
🔦 Spotlight: Third reserve; 1-15 over hurdles; 8.25l behind Rokathir latest at Punchestown in first time blinkers (retained); remains 6lb above last win and hard to see him turning that form around even off these revised terms.
