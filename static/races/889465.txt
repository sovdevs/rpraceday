üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Impressed at Carlisle but this is much hotter; others have more substance to their claims
üî¶ Spotlight: Point winner (good to yielding) who was second on hurdle debut at Bangor (2m, good to soft) then comfortably went one better at Carlisle (2m1f, good to soft); it remains to be seen where his limitations lie but he takes on vastly tougher opposition here; others have more substance to their claims.
