💬 Comment: Fifth in the Supreme Novices'; has work to do but he may well be capable of better
🔦 Spotlight: Easily won maiden hurdle at Tipperary (2m, good to yielding) last May and did well to win Grade 2 Moscow Flyer Novice Hurdle at Punchestown (2m1f, soft) in January having lacked fluency; about 11l behind third-placed Romeo Coolio when fifth in the Supreme Novices' (2m, good to soft) last month and this headstrong sort now goes without his usual hood, but there can be optimism he's capable of better than he showed at Cheltenham; possible player.
