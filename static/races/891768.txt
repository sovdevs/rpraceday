🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair handicapper who recently drew clear to make a winning hunter chase debut at Ludlow
🔦 Spotlight: Fair handicapper who drew nicely clear to make winning hunter chase debut at Ludlow (3m, good to soft) nine days ago; could quite plausibly have untapped potential over marathon trips; high on the list.
Horse quote: 2023-04-08 at Haydock (25.5f): "It was obvious what we had to do when Jeffery's Cross was qualified for the race, I had to sit on my hands. It was a bit frustrating having a horse ready to go when the good ground started appearing and he could have been running but it's very important to be fresh with him. Decent ground suits him as well. It was a good pot to win with a horse of that rating. Even if they stick him up 7lb he's still eligible for 0-120s and we'll see where we get to during the summer - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third in this last year; not at best this year but came second in a recent point
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who stayed on well for creditable third in this race 12 months ago (soft ground); not firing on all cylinders this year but took step back in right direction when second in a good-ground point last month.
Horse quote: 2024-01-22 at Warwick (24f): "This means the world to us. D'Jango is such a lovely horse. He had gone sour and didn't like racing anymore. He has been hunting quite a bit and that is what has sweetened him up, although we were a bit worried we weren't going to sweeten him up as he's eleven. I knew he stayed forever so I was hopeful he would catch Tea Clipper, but I didn't think we would - Victoria Collins, trainer."

💬 Comment: Made low-key hunter chase debut in February; second in three small-field points since
🔦 Spotlight: Formerly very useful for Gordon Elliott but made low-key stable/hunter chase debut in February and his three subsequent pointing seconds all came in small fields; swaps visor for refitted blinkers today.
Horse quote: 2022-10-04 at Galway (22.5f): "I'd imagine we'll head for something like the Troytown with Frontal Assault. Limerick (for the Munster National) might be a bit sharp for him but Navan could suit him. I thought he'd need the run but I'd say the race fell apart. I was pleased with what he did, though. Jack (Kennedy, rider) was positive on him - Gordon Elliott, trainer"

💬 Comment: Won open point over 3m4f on good ground in March; could have a say here
🔦 Spotlight: Signed off for Anthony Honeyball with a disappointing hurdle run last spring but seemingly back in good form in points for Harry Ryall this year, most notably when beating Assassins Lullaby by 7l in Cothelstone open (3m4f, good) in March; has cheekpieces refitted here; could have a say.
Horse quote: 2023-11-21 at Hereford (25.5f): "We got into a bit of a pickle at most of the obstacles. Norton Hill has a very interesting way of going. The principles of what he is doing are right but he is just not particularly quick at doing it. The nice thing is he came late, he was brilliant down the side to put a lot of pressure on and he clearly has a great attitude - Sam Twiston-Davies, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: In-form 9yo who made all under Cian Murphy for two easy wins in good-ground conditions points this spring (3m/3m6f); faces much tougher opposition on first rules start since April 2023 but still considered.

💬 Comment: Won 4m point on soft ground in February; shade disappointing on good ground next time
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful under rules for Nicky Henderson in 2023 and was evidently suited by the thorough stamina test when winning open point at Kingston Blount (4m, soft) in February; slightly disappointing when only third behind Norton Hill and Assassins Lullaby on good ground in March, though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made the frame in Taunton hunter chase in February but is nothing like the force of old
🔦 Spotlight: Useful staying chaser in his prime but became very disappointing for Venetia Williams during 2023-24 season; made the frame in Taunton hunter chase (2m7f, good to soft) for new stable in February but beat only one rival when winning a recent point; others look stronger.
Horse quote: 2018-12-30 at Haydock (20.5f): "Didero Vallis is a smashing horse and we always thought whatever he did over hurdles was a bonus as he's a chaser - Venetia Williams, trainer"
