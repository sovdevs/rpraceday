💬 Comment: Has won his last two 7f starts, over C&D in the second of them; good claims

📝 Comment: took keen hold, in touch with leaders, going okay when ⚠️ not clear run over 1f out, switched right and went third inside final furlong, no extra when tenderly handled and lost two places towards finish (jockey said, regarding running and riding, that his instructions were to obtain cover early in race and challenge between horses in home straight; he stated that he was happy with where gelding jumped leaving stalls and was positioned on rail, mid-division in an evenly run race; he further added that he was happy with way gelding was travelling throughout, before initially asking gelding to quicken approx 2f out; he went on to say that he was conscious that gelding needed to be produced late on and therefore was keen to delay his challenge as late as possible, switching right-handed for a run between Fieldsman and Arlo's Sunshine approx 1f out; in his opinion when giving gelding daylight between runners he soon felt that gelding had no more to give on run to line)

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off the mark at Southwell (6f) in October; knocking on the door over 7f of late
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark for previous yard at Southwell (6f) in October and he's been knocking on the door, without much luck, over 7f on that track of late; has course form, too, and he should find another opening at some stage.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Modest form, including when well held in a recent 7f Lingfield classified
🔦 Spotlight: Has had only a handful of starts but he couldn't find anything new when well held in a 7f classified at Lingfield recently and adding a tongue-tie needs to make a massive difference.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won his last two 7f starts, over C&D in the second of them; good claims
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of his two most recent 7f starts and while the runner-up (a triple winner since) was unlucky over C&D in the second of them, it was still good form; two solid efforts over 6f since; has every chance back at 7f.
