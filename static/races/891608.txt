🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran with credit at all the big meetings last year, including a C&D win; can progress again
🔦 Spotlight: Tough sprinter who ran a string of good races in hot handicaps last year, beating 15 rivals over C&D at Glorious Goodwood and adding a good Haydock event to his tally in September; absent since a midfield finish over 5.5f in the Portland at Doncaster; drying ground in his favour and he could develop into a Pattern horse this year; good chance.
Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Haydock (5f): "Shagraan was drawn on the wrong side and the ground was a bit on the softer side than ideal, but he's done it well. He's still improving and places like Bahrain might suit him, so we'll have a look at where we're going to go - Mick Appleby, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd on Newmarket return despite pulling early; behind Shagraan on three occasions in 2024
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well when third behind Shagraan in the big 3yo sprint handicap at Glorious Goodwood and went on to win over 6f at Windsor two weeks later; pulled his rider's arms out for the first furlong of his Newmarket reappearance two weeks ago and did well to finish second given those early exertions; should remain competitive and drying ground would suit.
Horse quote: 2023-06-09 at Bath (5.5f): "Toca Madera had done everything right first time, and was a little bit unlucky, but he did that well. We'll see how he comes out of it. He didn't like the ground but Kieran was very complimentary, saying he'll be better on much better ground. With rain round the corner Royal Ascot is a possibility - Brian Meehan, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Comes here having been in fine form on AW; 3lb rise for latest second could find him out
🔦 Spotlight: In good form on AW this year, winning two 5f handicaps at Southwell; latest second, at the hands of a handicap blot, was another fine effort; has run well at Goodwood in the past but a 3lb rise for the last run could just find him out.
Horse quote: 2023-06-23 at Ascot (5f): "Rhythm N Hooves was inexperienced coming into this, it was only his fifth race. He learnt a lot at York the last day, that was a big shock for him going from all-weather novices through to these 20, 25-runner handicaps. He has obviously shown a high level of ability here, so hopefully we can either go to more of these high-grade handicaps, but I wouldn't put it past going for a Listed race maybe with him at some point - Archie Watson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D win at Glorious Goodwood last summer; career best required back from eight months off
🔦 Spotlight: A wind operation in October 2023 proved successful and he had some smart sprint form last year, notably his narrow defeat of Miss Attitude over C&D at Glorious Goodwood (5f, good; made all); ran well off this mark at Southwell when last seen 246 days ago; back from an absence perhaps not the time to catch him though.
Horse quote: 2023-06-03 at Epsom (5f): "We thought Tatterstall had a nice chance. He hung when winning on his first run at Wolverhampton, and then at York he was only beaten about two and three-quarter lengths. This was the obvious race to come for, he likes the ground and Connor said he battled back - Chloe Dods, trainer's daughter."

💬 Comment: Conditions fine and she looked better than ever on AW in March; had excuses latest; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten a nose by Tatterstall in a Class 2 over C&D at last summer's Glorious meeting; better than ever on AW in March and she didn't get much luck in a Bath Listed event 12 days ago (stiff task); this should be more suitable and she represents last year's winning connections.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Progressed well in 2024; sharper for April's return; unlikely he's reached his ceiling
🔦 Spotlight: Form took off last year, winning a Class 4 event at York last June and adding two Class 2 handicaps at Ascot in the second half of the year; shaped as though the run was needed on his Southwell reappearance four weeks ago; mark left unchanged but some of his autumn form suggests he could still be well treated; Brandon Wilkie takes off a useful 3lb and he's more appealing than many.
Horse quote: 2024-10-04 at Ascot (6f): "I'm delighted and the little bit of juice in the ground helped Holkham Bay, as it was quick enough at Doncaster last time. We'll put him away now but we'll be looking forward to next year, and we hope he can be a nice horse for the big Saturday TV races. He loves Ascot and we'll definitely be looking towards June next year, especially if there's some juice in the ground, but for now he's earned a well-deserved holiday - William Knight, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hugely talented but on a long losing run and he's 3lb out of the weights here; e-w claims
🔦 Spotlight: Has bundles of ability but his losing run stretches back to February 2022 and he has spurned easier opportunities than this on AW over the winter; ran another good race back on turf at Epsom ten days ago when hemmed in against the stands' rail and keeping on well for second when finally seeing daylight; 3lb wrong today, however, and more minor money perhaps his best hope.
Horse quote: 2022-04-30 at Newmarket (5f): "Existent is a nice straightforward horse to deal with and hopefully he will now go on to the King's Stand Stakes. Tom (Morley, owner) and his mum have won the race twice before and we entered him for it last week. It is a bit of an ask, being rated 101, but we think he definitely warranted an entry and I think it should suit him. I think five is his best trip for us - Stuart Williams, trainer."
