🔦 Spotlight: Useful NH performer at his best; stayed on in a 1m4f Flat maiden at Bellewstown two weeks ago; this trip looks too sharp but can run respectably.
Horse quote: 2022-10-20 at Carlisle (20f): "I missed the second-last and wasn't sure I was going to get the second horse. Going off ratings, So Scottish will nearly have to be dropped. I was lucky to get there. Early in the race he was travelling very well, he missed the second last but apart from that he was fairly good - Richie McLernon, rider."
