🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor seventh in Lingfield handicap hurdle in December; good claims on best form though
🔦 Spotlight: 7-11 in points and a fairly useful maiden hurdler/chaser too but he comes here on the back of a poor seventh in 2m7f Lingfield handicap hurdle in December; has the form to play a big part if back on his A-game.
