🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: DRF and Champion Bumper winner and won the latter going away; 7lb mares' allowance helps
🔦 Spotlight: Won her rules debut here and couldn't have been any more impressive in the Grade 2 at the Dublin Racing Festival; well positioned when making it three from three under rules in the Champion Bumper and won going away; the mares' allowance helps and another big effort expected.
Horse quote: 2025-03-12 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "I got a perfect position. I couldn't believe it when I jumped off and managed to get where I wanted to be, usually that doesn't happen in that race. Once we turned down the hill and they got racing, Bambino Fever jumped on the bridle for me. It couldn't have gone any better. I was [pushed a bit wide coming into the straight] and even going away from the stands I was pushed quite wide, but I just didn't want to run into trouble. Even when she was pushed wide, I was travelling well enough, it didn't affect her. She keeps trying, she has a heart of gold - Jody Townend, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 this campaign including when well backed for DRF Gr 2 and that form is working out
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a bumper at this meeting last season before an impressive success at Galway in October and justified significant market support to win a Grade 2 bumper at the Dublin Racing Festival; that form has been boosted by the runner-up winning a bumper (also finished seventh in the Champion Bumper) and the fourth (Green Splendour) landing the Grade 2 Aintree bumper; this has been the long term plan and he has to be on the shortlist.
Horse quote: 2025-02-01 at Leopardstown (16f): "The whole intention after Colcannon won his bumper was to go jumping with him, but the schooling just wasn't going the way I wanted it to go. Unfortunately, he's not qualified for Cheltenham but I think he's okay for Punchestown, so we'll probably plan for that - Noel Meade."

💬 Comment: Very impressive at Navan on debut; had too much to do in the Champion Bumper but respected
🔦 Spotlight: Very impressive in a testing ground Navan bumper and probably had a bit too much to do when 9-2 for the Champion Bumper last month; likely to be a 🔥 big player in this smaller field and while his future probably lies over further, he's capable of running a big race.

Horse quote: 2024-12-15 at Navan (16f): "I'd say Kalypso'chance is a smart horse. He quickened really well. It was a nice race and I was happy with him. Patrick [Mullins, jockey] said he's a fair horse and we'll probably end up going to Leopardstown all being well - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

💬 Comment: Chased home Bambino Fever at DRF and won twice since; may struggled to reverse form though
🔦 Spotlight: Chased home Bambino Fever at the Dublin Racing Festival before a Naas bumper win and now bids for a hat-trick after a Listed success at Fairyhouse earlier this month; hard to see turning around the Bambino Fever form though.
Horse quote: 2025-04-06 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Switch From Diesel is a classy filly and she seems to have improved from run to run as the season's gone on. She's very exciting and she's probably as good a horse as I've had for a while. If everything stayed right with her she could be very good next season. The plan is to go to Punchestown and then put her out on summer's grass and go hurdling next year. She did an extra year in bumpers and Paul [Mullins, owner] was keen to do that. That was his plan and he stuck to it. She's turned into a real happy filly and that was very impressive. She has a high cruising speed and she'll make a lovely novice mare next year - Ross O'Sullivan, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner; made easy work of rules debut before Listed 3rd; may need further
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who made easy work of his rules debut at Down Royal before a respectable Listed third to re-opposing stablemate Kalypso'chance at Navan; likely to see him in a better light over longer distances but not without a chance.
