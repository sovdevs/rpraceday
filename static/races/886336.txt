🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo who has form figures of 142 since switched to AW, the success in 9.5f maiden at this course; solid effort over 1m6f here last time (emphatic winner has franked the form since); still open to further progress and warrants respect on first attempt at 1m4f.

🔦 Spotlight: Took well to first-time blinkers in C&D event ten days ago; back up 5lb for that success and returns to a higher grade (all wins in Class 5) but has possibilities in the retained headgear.

💬 Comment: Has form figures of 142 since switched to AW; solid effort here last time; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo who has form figures of 142 since switched to AW, the success in 9.5f maiden at this course; solid effort over 1m6f here last time (emphatic winner has franked the form since); still open to further progress and warrants respect on first attempt at 1m4f.
