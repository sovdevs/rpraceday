🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hat-trick of C&D wins last season; best run this term when third last time; has a chance
🔦 Spotlight: Had a good first season over fences with a hat-trick of C&D wins from December to March (soft, good to soft); let down by his jumping on first two starts this term but better effort when third at Newcastle (2m4f, good) last time; one with a chance.
