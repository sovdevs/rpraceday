🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In the thick of it against three of these at Doncaster last time; needs to get the breaks
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced here, won sole start at Chester; extremely solid sequence at about 1m2f last July-October and, having won a maiden hurdle in February, he was as good as ever when close fourth of 16 off this mark to City Of Delight and Magico at Doncaster (1m2f, good; unraced on firmer) last month; comes from off the pace and that latest start was far from the first time he's met trouble in running; well capable of a bold show if he gets the breaks.
Horse quote: 2025-02-16 at Musselburgh (15.5f): "Stressfree is a very talented horse on the Flat. It's only his second go today and Brian (Hughes) was pulling it up in front, and I knew we were going to quicken up the straight, so I was just hoping that his jumping was going to hold up, which it has done. There'll be a bigger picture for this horse I'm sure - Henry Brooke, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5-6 record over 1m2f, most recently with three of these rivals close up at Doncaster
🔦 Spotlight: Won last summer on his first four starts once stepped up to 1m2f, on a range of ground, and he reappeared with another significantly improved effort when mowing down three of today's rivals to grab a 16-runner race at Doncaster (1m2f, good); can be ridden more prominently than he was that day and, although up another 4lb, it's hard to rule out further progress.
Horse quote: 2024-08-24 at Goodwood (10f): "City Of Delight stays this trip really well and has a big heart. What stuck out to me was his will to win, he is admirable really - Kieran Shoemark, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Close at 1m2f twice this term, with fine burst at Doncaster latest against City Of Delight
🔦 Spotlight: Third in a maiden here early in career; ✂️ gelded in November and improved form when beaten a neck over 1m2f at Chelmsford (AW) and Doncaster (good) in his two starts this season; wore first-time cheekpieces in the latter, unleashing a fine burst to hit the front in the final 1f before he was himself cut down by City Of Delight; bit more to prove on good to firm; up 2lb but can defy that if things fall right for him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1m2f wins last May and September; further improvement is possible for in-form stable
🔦 Spotlight: Had 1m2f wins last May and September, latterly having to bide her time when she scored in last-gasp fashion at Haydock (good to soft; acts on good to firm); needs to improve but that's possible in this second season handicapping and the form of her stable is no disincentive.
Horse quote: 2023-10-10 at Leicester (8f): "Warda Jamila has done nothing wrong there and was professional on her second start. She has a great mind and it will be interesting to see where she ends up distance-wise as she is related to Coltrane and by Calyx. She's a nice type - Jason Watson, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Creditable fifth of 16 at Doncaster last month when just behind three of today's rivals
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile regarding ground and trip; had a solid season overall (1m6f and 1m2f winner) last year and reappeared with a creditable fifth of 16 at Doncaster last month when three of today's rivals had his measure but not by much; can make the running if necessary and he too is in the mix if he adapts to this track.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Yarmouth (10f): "It took us a while to really figure Rathgar out. I think his future lies over this kind of trip. He was relentless really, he jumped a lot better and he was able to keep the revs up from a long way out and responded well for pressure - David Probert, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never better than for Pontefract win (1m2f, good) eight days ago by 7l; has a 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice at Wolverhampton (9.4f, AW) late last year and never better than when winning at Pontefract (1m2f, good) eight days ago, seeing as he did it by 7l after leading in the final 1f; below form sole start here (last May) and carries a 5lb penalty but he has to be in calculations.
Horse quote: 2023-06-09 at Bath (8f): "King's Code is a big lad and, with the ground as quick as it was, I thought he might struggle a bit, which he did early doors. The cheekpieces helped him concentrate, the penny dropped late and he closed really well - Sean Levey, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: A messy Lincoln at Doncaster did not work out for him last time but he needs a second look
🔦 Spotlight: Ran respectably sole start here; 0-15 for this yard (multiple winner on the continent) but he ran well in defeat off higher marks at 1m/1m2f in Britain last summer and was the only one to threaten the odds-on Godolphin favourite when second of 16 in 1m1f handicap at Meydan in February; a messy Lincoln at Doncaster did not work out for him last month but he needs a second look.
