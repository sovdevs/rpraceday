🔦 Spotlight: His first win was on debut in July 2023 and his second was when making all in a first-time visor at Southwell (6f) last month; back up 3lb but his confidence should be boosted after that brave win; shortlisted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Record of 4-10 on AW and she had a near miss at Southwell last time; interesting contender
🔦 Spotlight: Ten of 11 runs have been on AW and she's won four, including three in a row at Newcastle (6f, Tapeta) in January; disappointing at Lingfield last month but she bounced back with a near miss at Southwell (7f) 11 days ago and is only 1lb higher on this drop back in trip; interesting.

💬 Comment: Two wins during the winter but wasn't at his best last time and he has a tough draw here
🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f wins at Chelmsford during the winter but his form can be up and down and he wasn't at his best at Chelmsford last time; now back up in trip but he needs to raise his game and stall 11 could make things tough.
