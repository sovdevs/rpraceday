🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Appreciated the return to 3m at Newbury and still nicely handicapped off 4lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Had been off for three months before finding 2m3f too sharp on her return to hurdling in February and was seen in a very different light back over 3m at Newbury (good to soft), winning a race in which she was second the year before when with Dan Skelton; still nicely handicapped off 4lb higher.

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't progressed since winning back-to-back good-ground handicaps in October (2m7f/2m4f) but could have needed it after a break at Ludlow last time (2m5f) and returning to further looks a good move.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7lb higher this afternoon but this is only her 12th start and clearly on the upgrade
🔦 Spotlight: Raised in grade here but she's 2-2 in this headgear combination having won easily at Taunton (3m) and again over 2m5f at Ludlow when 2lb well in; 7lb higher this afternoon but this is only her 12th start and clearly on the upgrade; good ground seems ideal.
Horse quote: 2025-03-25 at Taunton (24f): "It's been a long time and we were beginning to wonder what we had to do to make Elusiveness win. I think the better ground and headgear helped with her jumping and probably it wasn't a very good race. I think we can build on today. She's big enough to jump a fence and there are plenty of races she could run in - Jeremy Scott, trainer."
