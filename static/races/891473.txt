🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pushed Stellarmasterpiece hard over C&D two weeks ago; pair are closely matched upped 2lb
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish veteran who turned in his best effort for this yard (hurdle win late last year came in a weak seller) when pushing Stellarmasterpiece hard over C&D a fortnight ago; is closely matched with that one upped 2lb.
Horse quote: 2023-07-11 at Tramore (12f): "That was my fourth win on Magnetic North, he's been a great servant to me, I rode my first winner on him. He's in the form of his life now. He loves that, dictating it and the tight bends around here really suited him - Adam Caffrey, jockey, talking to Racing TV"

💬 Comment: Made it 2-3 over C&D when seeing off Magnetic North two weeks ago; leading claims up 3lb
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't take to hurdles and duly made it 2-3 over C&D when seeing off Magnetic North back on the Flat two weeks ago; has been found another ordinary handicap as she looks to defy a 3lb rise in the weights.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Decent 3yo hurdler who's regressed since; interesting to see how he goes in the market
🔦 Spotlight: Decent juvenile hurdler who's regressed since; however, this trip is clearly much more suitable than the 1m he's twice tackled on the AW this spring, now handicapping; interesting to see how he goes in the market.
Horse quote: 2023-12-16 at Cheltenham (17f): "The Fred Winter is what we discussed two or three weeks ago. An Bradan Feasa would be 50-1 in a Triumph Hurdle, but although he will go up again today he would have a competitive enough weight in the Fred Winter. He will have a quiet enough time now and he will have one more run before March and see where we end up. He is very easy to ride, and Tom said he is an absolute delight. It (the Fred Winter) wouldn't be any bother to him. He has sat third there today and you could let him sit mid division to the rear in the Fred Winter and let him travel away  - Jack Jones, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: No stamina issues when second at a big price here last backend (2m, soft); hasn't built on that since and switches from cheekpieces to a visor as she returns to turf and returns to 1m4f.
