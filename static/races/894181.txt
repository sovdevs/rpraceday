🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden; placed in last five handicaps and tough task over 1m6f latest; Tapeta debut
🔦 Spotlight: Not yet off the mark, but he's been placed in his last five handicaps and had little hope against a subsequent wide-margin winner at Chelmsford (1m6f) when back from a break; has stamina still to prove on Tapeta debut but this is realistic.

🔦 Spotlight: Had little trouble in shaking off his rivals when upped to 2m at Southwell in February and he ran a sound race in defeat when third over that C&D in April; looks one of the better options if proving suited by this track on first run here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole AW win in a classified event but 10lb lower than 2m turf win in September; involved
🔦 Spotlight: Well treated on turf form, such as when winning at Chester (2m) in September off 10lb higher, but he rarely shines on AW and his sole win on sand came in a classified; should still be involved at this level, though.
Horse quote: 2024-09-13 at Chester (16f): "Corsican Caper loves this type of ground, so he'll probably keep going through the autumn. He's not hard on himself and hopefully there's a bit of improvement in him. He'll cope with a bigger track as well and anything from a mile-six to two miles will suit him - Kevin Frost, trainer."

💬 Comment: Turf win at 2m in August but AW form is mixed and below best over hurdles of late
🔦 Spotlight: Won off a similar mark on turf (2m) in August, but she's run some ordinary races on the AW since finishing close up at Kempton in January 2024 and recent hurdle efforts raise questions about her current form.
Horse quote: 2021-03-11 at Wincanton (15.5f): "Triple Nickle likes the soft ground and had that Flat speed at the end - Robert Williams, jockey."

Horse quote: 2019-06-30 at Uttoxeter (16f): "Chef De Troupe was entitled to win after his easy win at Southwell last week under a penalty. He was inclined to jump to his right again but actually seemed much better when able to take a lead. He is progressive - Sean Bowen, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In the frame over 1m2f-1m4f in France; has gone walkabout over hurdles and on AW of late
🔦 Spotlight: In the frame at 1m2f-1m4f in France last year; initially ran quite promisingly over hurdles in Britain but he's gone walkabout this year, including on AW in April; has it to prove at present.
