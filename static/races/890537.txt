🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won on heavy ground in February and both subsequent good-ground runs were very respectable
🔦 Spotlight: Came good over fences with wide-margin success at Leicester (2m4f, heavy) in February and both subsequent runs on good ground (2m3f/2m7f) were perfectly respectable; likely to give another good account here.
Horse quote: 2025-02-25 at Leicester (20f): "Shesupincourt has been knocking on the door and was always going to win over fences, it's just been a matter of when. She loves testing ground so the conditions were ideal for her - she likes it borderline unraceable. Ryan Potter, trainer."
