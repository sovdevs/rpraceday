💬 Comment: Expensive purchase ran well on debut at Thurles, form has been boosted, big chance
🔦 Spotlight: 0-3 in point-to-points; expensively bought No Risk At All gelding sent off at 9-2 for Thurles debut (15.5f, good) last month and found just one too good; fifth from that race went on to win next time out; leading chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Has attracted market support for all three starts, finishing second twice; went closest on latest when beaten 0.5l at Naas (2m, good to yielding) after a 108-day break when an 8-11 favourite; should improve for that run; leading form claims.

💬 Comment: Well-bred but never landed a blow on soft on debut, could improve for quicker ground
🔦 Spotlight: Leading Light gelding is related to some smart types but he never looked like landing a blow when 3-1 on debut at Fairyhouse (2m, soft); however, improvement could be forthcoming on quicker ground; can't be discounted for leading yard.

🔦 Spotlight: Was 66-1 for his Leopardstown debut but he didn't run badly, beaten 11l into fifth of 9; should improve for that experience and his yard had a recent winner at Tramore but more will be needed to win this.
