📝L2 Comment: dwelt start, in rear throughout, no chance when ⚠️ not clear run inside final furlong (an inquiry was held into the running and riding of hala joza, ridden by darragh keenan and trained by martin dunne, which jumped awkwardly before being restrained from stall 10 to race in rear throughout and staying on fairly in the home straight under considerate handling to finish eighth of eight runners,  beaten 8½ lengths. the rider was interviewed and shown recordings of the race and the veterinary officer  examined the filly post-race and had nothing to report. the rider stated that, from his wide draw, his instructions were to get in and sit halfway down the field and to ride his race from there. he stated that his filly was a little slow into stride and whilst he wanted to drop in, there was some interference on his inside so he elected to stay wide and clear of any trouble. he went on to say that this left him three wide and further back than ideal, so he opted to drop in and hope to follow miss campanella through but that filly was running green and did not carry him into the race as hoped. he added that once in the straight when he had intended to ask hala joza for her full effort and obtain clear running, he was impeded by blue force one which had lugged right-handed into his path and resulted in him having to take avoiding action, which he reported at the scales. he went on to say that he had advised connections the filly might improve for a step up in trip and being ridden more prominently. his explanation was noted.)
