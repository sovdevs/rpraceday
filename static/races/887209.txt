🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Formerly smart; novice win latest; needs markedly better but perhaps he's on his way back
🔦 Spotlight: Smart in his 2021-22 season over fences; lightly raced since and absent 643 days before this term but he rallied in fine style to win a novice hurdle at Uttoxeter (near 3m, soft) on latest outing; needs markedly better in this handicap but perhaps he's on his way back.
