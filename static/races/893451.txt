🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Gowran maiden by wide margin; up 3lb for that; third in 1m4f Curragh handicap since
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner finally off the mark over hurdles after a frustrating sequence when winning a Gowran maiden by a wide margin; up 3lb for that; staying-on third in 1m4f Curragh handicap since.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Gowran Park (16f): "Whimsy finally got there. A big thanks has to go to Paddy Hanlon and Paddy Graffan the last day as if she had gotten away with it, she mightn't have started today.  I went down to the start to make sure. We wanted to make the running, but it didn't work out. Oakley [Brown, jockey] said she found another leg once she turned in. She loves that ground, so I was glad to see all the rain coming. It's brilliant to get over the line over hurdles and I thought the handicapper was a wee bit harsh putting her up 3lb for the last day, but I suppose I'll have to eat my words now. I didn't know what way she'd go being out the back but she enjoyed it Oakley said. We might get something at Fairyhouse for her and if the ground is heavy, it would be ideal - Anthony McCann, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Down Royal maiden winner was never involved in Grade 2 novice at Kelso; handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in Listed bumper at four; off the mark on second start over hurdles when landing Down Royal maiden (2m1f, good to yielding) in January; tongue-tied when big price and never involved in Grade 2 novice at Kelso; handicap debut.
Horse quote: 2025-01-21 at Down Royal (17f): "It has just taken a while for everything to fall into place. Putapoundinthejar is still relatively young and immature. Today's race turned into a great opportunity with Willie's not there. We always thought he was a nice young horse and we still do - Tony Martin, trainer."

💬 Comment: Creditable third on handicap debut at Wexford and first two home have both won since
🔦 Spotlight: Leopardstown maiden winner (2m, yielding) was creditable third on handicap debut at Wexford and the first two home have both won since.
Horse quote: 2025-03-02 at Leopardstown (16f): "We have eventually got it right with Solsbury Hill. We've tried everything - different trips, put a hood on him the last day and took it off today. In fairness to Charlie he was adamant that he wanted to drop him in and get him switched off down the inner, but it was fairly rough early on. There was a lot of hustle and bustle. He was probably a little bit further back than he wanted to be, but Charlie was adamant that once he switches off, he has plenty of pace. They went a strong pace and it all worked out well for him. He jumped super down the back and produced a nice turn of foot. He'll definitely go chasing next season as he jumps a fence super and is a nice one to look forward to - Conor O'Dwyer, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: After a layoff, was fourth on stable debut at Navan (soft) last month and came forward from that to win at Ballinrobe (2m1f, good); was well clear of 118-rated third there so could be fairly treated under 7lb claimer.

💬 Comment: Was poised to challenge when falling two out back over 2m on handicap debut at Thurles
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner and won Clonmel maiden (2m, good) on hurdles/yard debut in November; well held twice over longer trips but was poised to challenge when falling two out back over 2m on handicap debut at Thurles in January; off since.
Horse quote: 2024-11-07 at Clonmel (16f): "The final hurdle was the winning of the race for Stuntman Steve and thankfully he came up for me. We have him six weeks and while he hadn't been away, we thought he was a nice horse so thought he'd go close - Keith Donoghue, jockey."
