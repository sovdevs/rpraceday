💬 Comment: Broke duck when clear winner of C&D classified last week; obvious chance
🔦 Spotlight: Took time to break his duck but, having raced at up to 7f previously, he's found improvement at about 1m for his new yard and looked better than classified level when a clear C&D winner last week; obvious chance for trainer/jockey team going great guns.
