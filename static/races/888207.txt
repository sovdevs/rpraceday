🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Mark and form both obvious plus points, less so this sharp 3m and the likely good ground.
🔦 Spotlight: Remains on the same lowest mark since November 2021 following last week's win in a Market Rasen conditional riders' handicap (3m4f, good to soft); longer still since he won over a sharp 3m, however, and a record of 0-11 on good ground versus 7-16 on softer inevitably concerns.

🔦 Spotlight: Second at Fakenham on New Year's Day in debuted cheekpieces (2m5f, good to soft), but weakened over today's C&D next time and wind surgery has followed; good ground has been deemed unsuitable once previously.
