Horse quote: 2022-06-11 at Chester (12.5f): "Bamboo Bay's draw was a help and the gaps opened and he lengthened from the three-pole. You could step him up in trip and he's probably handicapped well enough - Kevin Stott, jockey"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m Wetherby winner last June when with Ian Williams; modest form over hurdles for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Wetherby handicap last June (2m, good to firm) and was placed on the AW on last two starts when with Ian Williams; not shown much in three runs over hurdles for present yard; needs to bounce back.
