🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Little solid form but had an excuse (draw) last time and 🔍 unexposed over 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Well held in three sprint runs as a 2yo; attracted support on his handicap/AW debut at Newcastle in March (7f) but finished well beaten; poor draw at Redcar ten days ago; may yet do better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reappearance 4th came in steadily run race & may not be solid; 7f should suit; h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Appeared to show improved form on her reappearance at Kempton five weeks ago (6f) but that was a steadily run affair and the form may not be solid; stepping up to 7f should suit now handicapping though.

🔦 Spotlight: No better than sixth in three 6f novice/maiden runs in the latter part of 2024; cheekpieces fitted for this handicap debut and the extra furlong may help too.
