🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Revitalised by wind/gelding ops last summer; easy win in Listed race latest; strong claims
🔦 Spotlight: Smart 2yo who won a French Group 3 on his 3yo reappearance; things went south after a promising seasonal return last March but a gelding operation and, perhaps more significantly a wind op, have reinvigorated him this winter, winning a 6f handicap at Newcastle last month and impressing in a Listed race at Lingfield 20 days ago; drop back to 5f no concern and he's a strong contender despite his 3lb penalty.

🔦 Spotlight: The winner of seven of his 12 starts on AW (2-2 over 5f), notably when defying a penalty in the corresponding event 12 months ago; not at his best when behind Marshman on his return from 197 days off on February 2nd; should be sharper today and he's one to take seriously.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-3 at Dundalk since October; won easily (6f) latest but dictated a steady pace
🔦 Spotlight: Smart 2yo, winning the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot (Group 2) and chasing home Big Evs in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint; struggled in top sprints last summer but an ease in grade and a switch to AW has revived his fortunes, winning over 5f in October and pulling clear in a four-runner race at Dundalk two weeks ago (6f; set steady fractions); not sure that latest run is evidence he's back to his peak though and he didn't look entirely straightforward in the closing stages.

🔦 Spotlight: Won back-to-back 6f handicaps on AW this time last year, notably the big sprint on Good Friday; only had two runs on AW since then, doing best of the prominent racers in a Group 3 last June and then making an eyecatching stable debut at Kempton ten days ago; he was drawn wide, keen and held up off a slow pace but made some good late headway on that occasion, looking to retain all his ability; tackles 5f for the first time today and it looks an interesting move; should go well.
