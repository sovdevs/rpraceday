💬 Comment: Finished tired on soft ground last time but autumn form suggests he can pose a threat
🔦 Spotlight: Won good-ground Plumpton bumper last spring and made good start to hurdling career in the the autumn, easily dispatching modest opposition at Southwell (2m, good) before a C&D third (good to soft); finished tired when upped to 2m3f on soft ground at Catterick in January but was given a wind op soon afterwards and can pose a threat if back on song today.
