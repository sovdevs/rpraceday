🔦 Spotlight: Won well at Southwell two weeks ago; a 4lb rise puts him on a career-high mark but he hasn't had many attempts over this trip, or on Tapeta, and could well be up to the task.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Long odds-on to blow the start and doesn't come without risk, minus headgear tonight
🔦 Spotlight: Handles Tapeta but is best known for his Chelmsford work and has three poor efforts to his name here, including one at a short price; is long odds-on to blow the start too, so doesn't come without risk, going without headgear for the first time in ages.

🔦 Spotlight: Got up to beat Robusto in a busy finish off 2lb lower at Southwell in January before out of his depth in Group 3 company on his first start for Martin Dunne three weeks ago; there's little room for manoeuvre off this mark.
