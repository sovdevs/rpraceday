🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrow winner of Wolverhampton classified on Tuesday, her second stable start; respected
🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 when trained in Ireland but came good for James Owen at the second attempt, keeping on well for narrow success in 9.4f Wolverhampton classified on Tuesday (first-time visor); carries a 5lb penalty in this handicap but could quite plausibly have more to offer for her new stable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In the frame all three starts since narrow C&D win in December; likely contender again
🔦 Spotlight: Prevailed by a neck to open account over C&D in December, his seventh start, and has made the frame three consecutive times since (1m-1m2f); behind Sir Laurence Graff and slightly disappointing here last month but still features prominently in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconsistent nowadays but won here in October and went close last month
🔦 Spotlight: Regressive and inconsistent 5yo; not an easy one to predict but he won over C&D off 3lb lower in September and lost out only narrowly to Baikal (runs in Division 1 of this race) here last month; a possible.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**

🔦 Spotlight: 50-1 second over C&D in first-time blinkers when back on the Flat in January 2024, his second start for Robbie Llewellyn, and subsequently came third over 2m here; arguably ran better than finishing position suggests when sixth here last month, after a layoff, and has possibilities today if that outing did him good; visor refitted.
