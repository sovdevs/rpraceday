💬 Comment: Third on handicap/chase debut at Catterick and this point winner could have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point last April (3m, good to yielding) and he showed improved form when third on his handicap and chase debut at Catterick (2m3f, soft) in January last time; could have more to offer now back on better ground in first-time headgear and he's one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Returned to form when third at Fakenham (2m5f, good) in January and won here (2m3f, good to soft) last month; the final-fence leader Beat The Edge threw the race away last time but this fellow deserves extra credit as his saddle slipped; remains feasibly treated back up 4lb; in with a chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconsistent; well beaten at Hereford latest but went very close at Catterick previously
🔦 Spotlight: Has a very in-and-out profile and well beaten at Hereford last month; however, he's run plenty of good races across the last two seasons and went very close at Catterick two starts ago; not ruled out.
