🔦 Spotlight: He won his first two races this season (2m5f/2m3f, soft/good to soft) and has been a good second the last twice, most recently behind The Flier Begley at Market Rasen (2m5f, good to soft); he's 4lb better off with the winner for just over 3l and is firmly in calculations.

🔦 Spotlight: No match for the winner when second at Warwick (2m4f, soft) last Saturday but that still represented a welcome return to form; another 2lb lower today and he's a possible player in reapplied cheekpieces (albeit they didn't have an obviously positive impact when worn once previously).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Behind two of these last time but set a strong pace and continues to edge down the weights
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who hasn't been at his best this term and was a 12l third behind two of these at Market Rasen (2m5f, good to soft) last time; however, he deserves credit for that performance having set a strong pace and he continues to drop down the weights; every chance he'll make a bold bid.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ended last season in good form; needs to be fully tuned up on this first run since
🔦 Spotlight: Ended last season with a win at Ayr (2m4f, good) then a creditable second over C&D (soft) in the final of this series; could be in the mix on this first run since if he's fully tuned up, but that's the big question.
