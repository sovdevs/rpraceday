💬 Comment: Runner-up in two juvenile hurdles and in calculations now against older horses
🔦 Spotlight: 4yo; good-ground Flat winner who was runner-up on hurdle debut at Market Rasen (2m, good to soft) in December and filled same position at Wetherby (2m, soft) last month; there's room for improvement in his jumping and he could settle better now in a hood; in calculations now against older horses.

🔦 Spotlight: Creditable fifth in Flat Group 3 last April for Hugo Palmer; failed to kick on from there but didn't run badly in AW handicap in October when last seen; has since changed hands for 52,000gns; brings potential to his hurdle and stable debut; interesting to see how he goes in the betting.

🔦 Spotlight: 4yo; good-ground Flat winner who was runner-up on hurdle debut at Market Rasen (2m, good to soft) in December and filled same position at Wetherby (2m, soft) last month; there's room for improvement in his jumping and he could settle better now in a hood; in calculations now against older horses.

🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten in sole bumper and pulled up on subsequent hurdle debut; has since left Matt Sheppard (remains in same ownership); hard to fancy.
