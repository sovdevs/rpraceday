💬 Comment: Fell in a Grade 2 chase last time; could be dangerous off this mark back over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Has gained both his wins from the front, the chase success coming at Chepstow in November (similar trip to today's on good to soft) off only 2lb lower; suffered his second fall over fences mid-race in a Grade 2 last time and could be dangerous off this mark back over hurdles.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Regressed over fences but returns to hurdling in first-time headgear; on a good mark
🔦 Spotlight: The wheels have rather come off over fences, after last season had started so well, and he's now back over hurdles with first-time headgear applied; nothing wrong with his mark if he can get back on track.

💬 Comment: Dual winner but does have a habit of coming up short even when on his game
🔦 Spotlight: Won two handicaps (2m/2m2f) in Ireland when based with Jessica Harrington; confined to novice hurdles by current yard and was running well until last time; he does have a habit of coming up short even when on his game.

💬 Comment: Has some flashes of smart form but 3m looks more her trip
🔦 Spotlight: Listed winner last season before running respectably in a 3m Grade 1 at Aintree; after a brief stint over hurdles she was only 7l away in an Ayr handicap (3m, soft) and she had a lot to find in a Grade 2 last time; the main concern is that 3m is probably her trip.

💬 Comment: Fell in a Grade 2 chase last time; could be dangerous off this mark back over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Has gained both his wins from the front, the chase success coming at Chepstow in November (similar trip to today's on good to soft) off only 2lb lower; suffered his second fall over fences mid-race in a Grade 2 last time and could be dangerous off this mark back over hurdles.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has some flashes of smart form but 3m looks more her trip
🔦 Spotlight: Listed winner last season before running respectably in a 3m Grade 1 at Aintree; after a brief stint over hurdles she was only 7l away in an Ayr handicap (3m, soft) and she had a lot to find in a Grade 2 last time; the main concern is that 3m is probably her trip.

💬 Comment: Beaten only 3l by a 📈 progressive winner at Windsor last time; that's solid form
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins split evenly between hurdles and fences; has run well in both his handicap hurdles this season, latterly beaten only 3l by the 📈 progressive Secret Squirrel at Windsor (2m, soft; under Will Featherstone); has competitive form over C&D; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Capable on his day but may be vulnerable over this shorter trip (last win was at 3m)
🔦 Spotlight: Not the easiest to predict but capable on his day and ran respectably with this headgear back on over the extended 2m5f here on Boxing Day (good to soft); may be vulnerable over this shorter trip (last win was at 3m).
