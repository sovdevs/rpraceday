🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won last two races on AW last year; fair comeback run; a chance but high enough at present
🔦 Spotlight: Won his last two races on the AW last year (1m2f/1m4f) and fair return to action when 4l second at Newcastle three weeks ago (1m2f); just as effective on turf (good second over C&D last September) and handles fast ground; a possible but may find others better treated.

🔦 Spotlight: Two decent AW runs in February and off the mark at Yarmouth last time (1m2f, good; fourth has won since); only 2lb higher, stiffer track should suit and an interesting contender.

💬 Comment: Five-time C&D winner; should come on for reappearance run, on a winning mark and a chance
🔦 Spotlight: Has won five times over C&D (good/good to firm), the latest off this mark in July last year; should be all the better for reappearance run at Redcar; stable going well; chance.
Horse quote: 2024-07-28 at Pontefract (10f): "Highwaygrey likes fast ground and likes a stiff finish. He travels into it well and it seems to suit him this track - William Easterby, trainer's assistant, talking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Won four times at up to 1m2f for David O'Meara, latest at Redcar in May 2023 (1m2f, good to firm); yet to win for current yard, but several good runs last term and is well handicapped at present (15lb lower than last winning mark); lacks a recent run.
