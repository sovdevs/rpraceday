🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second off this mark over hurdles in Feb; hasn't built on that; back over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 0-15 over hurdles when beaten about 10l at Warwick two weeks ago (3m2f, good) and he unseated midrace when trying fences once before in August 2023; on the plus side, he did finish second off this mark at Fakenham in February.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor hurdle form but showed something in a bumper and now tries fences; early days still
🔦 Spotlight: Showed some promise in a Newbury bumper but either tailed off or pulled up in his four runs over hurdles, the latest his handicap debut (2m7f, soft); worth another try over this far on drier ground as he's bred to stay, and perhaps fences can trigger something.
