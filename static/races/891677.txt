🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won two of his last three (new headgear both times); contender if in the right mood
🔦 Spotlight: Scored in first-time cheekpieces at Bangor (2m3f, soft) in December and put a lesser run behind him when winning in first-time blinkers there (2m1f, soft) in February; it's hard to predict how well he'll perform in refitted cheekpieces but the forecast good ground won't be a problem.
Horse quote: 2022-03-19 at Uttoxeter (20f): "It was a very nice debut from New Found Fame and he's a very well-bred horse. He's showed us all the right signs at home and we knew he needed soft ground. He's a little bit delicate so I wanted to come to a lower key meeting and give him a nice experience. He did it really nicely and I hope he'll be a three-mile chaser - Kerry Lee, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Absent since pulled up in two handicaps in late 2024 but looked quite useful when winning Ascot maiden (2m3f, good) 13 months ago and will be dangerous off current mark if back on song after wind surgery.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up in a chase in February and also disappointed over hurdles last month
🔦 Spotlight: Made good start to chasing career in the autumn, but ran poorly over fences in February and also disappointed when back over hurdles last month; may benefit from this drop back in trip but still has a point to prove.
Horse quote: 2024-03-28 at Fontwell (17.5f): "I think Getaway Drumlee can be all right. He'll overcome a fence as well, but I'd imagine he'll go on through May and then we'll give him a break before we go chasing with him next season. He ran a blinder at Doncaster and better than I expected him to. It was great to see him follow up as he jumped and travelled beautifully, and it's nice to see Beau [Morgan, jockey] getting a couple of nice winners for us towards the end of the season. He had a couple of nasty problems - a fibrillating heart and a fractured fetlock - after Sandown when he last ran before this season, so he's had to overcome quite a bit. He's got a good attitude and it's brilliant to see his head back in front for his owners, who have shown so much patience with him - Ben Pauling, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a juvenile hurdle in November but recent AW form is uninspiring
🔦 Spotlight: Fair Flat racer who won against own age-group on stable/hurdle debut at Ludlow (2m, good) in November; not disgraced on next two hurdling starts but recent AW form is uninspiring; upped in trip for this handicap hurdle debut; others appeal more.
