🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Completed Grade 1 hat-trick in this last year, can step up from Stayers' Hurdle second
🔦 Spotlight: Leading stayer whose success in the 2024 Stayers' Hurdle (soft) was the middle leg of a Grade 1 hat-trick completed with an emphatic defeat of Asterion Forlonge in this race; no match for Lossiemouth over 2m4f in the Hattons's Grace on return; beaten by Bob Olinger at Cheltenham but showed enough to suggest he can repeat last year's victory.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (24f): "No excuse, really. Maybe if the ground was a shade slower it would have taken the sting out of the other lad a little bit, but no excuse. I was probably left [in front] a little bit early, but Teahupoo is a genuine horse who would gallop away in front there. I sort of knew Rachael was going fairly well - well, I knew there was something beside be, I didn't know exactly what it was. Bob Olinger is a horse with loads of ability and he's just put it all together today - Jack Kennedy, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled at Gowran, restored to form in Aintree Grade 1 in which Home By The Lee flopped
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2 winner at Navan, and Grade 1-placed at Aintree in the first half of 2024; second to Crambo in the Long Walk at Ascot in December; struggled badly in Galmoy won by Rocky's Diamond; restored to form when beating Strong Leader in Aintree Grade 1 in which Home By The Lee flopped.
Horse quote: 2025-04-05 at Aintree (24.5f): "Hiddenvalley Lake is a lovely horse. It's worked out really well for us. He really stuck at it. I always thought he wanted softer ground and I was a bit nervous about the ground, but you could say he's improved for it - Henry De Bromhead, trainer.I must say that Henry had a big deal to do with this. There was no pace looking at the race and we were toying with the idea of making the running on Hiddenvalley Lake. Henry came back in and said ride him the way you normally do. He handled the ground brilliantly and travelled so well. He stays really well - Darragh O'Keefe, jockey."

💬 Comment: Highly 📈 progressive young stayer, maintained upward curve with Stayers' Hurdle fourth
🔦 Spotlight: Highly 📈 progressive in three starts since 3m handicap win at Gowran last autumn; 66-1 third behind Home By The Lee and Bob Olinger in Grade 1 at Leopardstown (2m7f, yielding) in December and won the Grade 2 Galmoy at Gowran Park (3m, soft to heavy) in January; maintained upward curve with Stayers' Hurdle fourth; may get closer to Teahupoo now.
Horse quote: 2025-01-23 at Gowran Park (24.5f): "Rocky's Diamond is only five and has a great wind and demeanour. He's very cool and acts like an older horse. He's entered in the Stayers'. I don't know whether this is a good enough trial but we'll probably take our chance. It was trappy but Shane used his head and didn't let it turn into a s print." - Declan Queally, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: High-class stayer, third in this last year, has to bounce back after two failures
🔦 Spotlight: Third behind Teahupoo in this race last year, and previously took same place in the Stayer's at Cheltenham; beat Bob Olinger in Graded races last November/December, prior to having no luck (hampered by faller and unseated rider mid-race) in the Stayers' Hurdle; flopped in Aintree race won by Hiddenvalley Lake, so prospects should be treated with caution.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Leopardstown (23.5f): "I'd say that was close to a career-best from him. He's been around for a number of years now and will go back to Cheltenham for the Stayers' with an each-way chance - Joseph O'Brien, trainer of Home By The Lee"

💬 Comment: Solid third behind Hiddenvalley Lake at Aintree, deserves another shot at the geldings
🔦 Spotlight: Won 3m Doncaster Grade 2 mares' win in January and ran respectably in the 2m4f Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham; confirmed her stamina with a pleasing display to take third behind Hiddenvalley Lake at Aintree; deserves another shot at the geldings.
Horse quote: 2025-01-25 at Doncaster (24.5f): "Jetara was second to Ballyburn at Punchestown and she had rock-solid form last season. We thought we were going to go to all heights this season, she won a Listed race and she won on the Flat but then she was disappointing at Navan - she was in season after that - and the ground was a bit quick for her at Leopardstown. The step up to three miles and the cheekpieces really helped. Onwards to Cheltenham, she's in the mares' hurdle and the three-miler - Kate Harrington, trainer's daughter."

🔦 Spotlight: Made it back-to-back wins in the Grade 1 Long Walk Hurdle (3m, good/good to soft) at Ascot in December; soundly beaten in the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham in January after making a bad mistake five out; fell at the sixth when 40-1 chance for the Stayers'; first time cheekpieces added to the usual tongue-tie.
Horse quote: 2024-12-21 at Ascot (24.5f): "Crambo has been a big part of my career and helped me to get the job with Fergal. His form tailed off last year and it's a big effort by everyone. He missed Newbury [the Long Distance Hurdle], but it's a blessing now. We had Sammy [Twiston-Davies on Beauport] go on, but I was always happy where I was. All credit goes to Crambo, he filled up when I needed him and he jumped very well. He was very, very brave today and I'm very proud of him - Jonathan Burke, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor strike rate but has often held his own in demanding company, tackles a new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Has a poor strike-rate over hurdles (1-20) but placed on 14 occasions, and has often held his own in demanding company; fifth in the Coral Cup and fourth in a Grade 2 event over 2m4f at Fairyhouse ten days ago; goes beyond 2m5f for the first time now.
Horse quote: 2021-10-23 at Galway (16.5f): "We knew before the race we'd have to make the running and I wasn't really worried about that but it is a relief more than anything. There was so much expectation riding on Colonel Mustard to nail the maiden and get it done and he has. It will give him huge confidence and I think we now have a good bar from what he did last season. I hope we have a lot to look forward to now and I'd like to take him to Cheltenham in three weeks for the Supreme Novices Trial because I think it'll be good to get there and see how he travels - Lorna Fowler, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Profited from mishaps to take third place in the Champion Hurdle, has won over 3m
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who recorded his biggest success in a 2m Grade 3 contest at Tipperary last July before finishing fourth in the Galway Hurdle; his last four races have been in 2m Grade 1 events, profiting from mishaps to take third place in the Champion Hurdle on latest; won over 3m at Cork in July 2023 but would be a shock winner here.
Horse quote: 2024-07-04 at Tipperary (16f): "Winter Fog is a very fast horse and had been running over further because we had been trying to find suitable races. He probably handled the ground better than anything. He might well go for the Galway Hurdle now - Patrick Mullins, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Gained first win for almost three years at Limerick three starts back, no appeal here
🔦 Spotlight: 2-15 over hurdles, capable of smart form, such as when third behind Home By The Lee in a 3m Grade 1 at Leopardstown in December 2022; gained first win for almost three years at Limerick three starts back, up against it in this company.
Horse quote: 2022-02-12 at Naas (15.5f): "Meet And Greet had a few niggly problems since the last day but that was good. The rail helped him in the end, I thought for a while that Rachael was holding him. I'm delighted we won it anyway. On a little bit better ground he'd be even better and he'll probably be heading for Fairyhouse and Punchestown - Oliver McKiernan, trainer."
