🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Appreciated the good ground when a convincing winner at Chepstow; penalised
🔦 Spotlight: Perhaps needed the run at Leicester after 350 days away and reportedly appreciated the good ground when quite a convincing winner at Chepstow (2m3f, good) 11 days ago; has a penalty but that might not stop him if he performs to the same level.

💬 Comment: Close third on his chase debut but he did look a hard ride in the first-time blinkers
🔦 Spotlight: Only his seventh career start when a close third on his chase debut at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) where he looked a hard ride in the first-time blinkers before emerging on the scene; remains to be seen whether he builds on that; this longer trip shouldn't be an issue.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in November so the ability is there should he be all the better for a break
🔦 Spotlight: Improved form when second on his chase debut at Market Rasen (2m5f, good; first-time tongue-tie) earlier this season but two lesser runs followed; the ability is there should he be all the better for a break.
