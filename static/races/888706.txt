🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in a pair of strong maiden hurdles, slight edge over C'Est Ta Chance on bumper form
🔦 Spotlight: Smart bumper form, winning at Navan (beat C'Est Ta Chance) and Naas before fine third to Redemption Day in Grade 1 event here; reversed form with that rival when second in a strong maiden on hurdles debut at Leopardstown; good chance here on the strength of seconds to the promising Kawaboomga at Fairyhouse; room for improvement in his jumping.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; beaten a short head by today's rival William Munny on bumper debut at Navan last season; down the field in Grade 1 bumper at Cheltenham; fair fourth at Ayr in April; got the job done at odds-on on hurdling debut at Clonmel despite an untidy round of jumping; picked up useful experience at Navan and has an edge over Taponthego on that running.
