🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved efforts in h'caps on good/good to yielding, chance if handling the softer ground
🔦 Spotlight: Has improved for switch to handicaps; remote third at Clonmel (18.5f, good) followed by a 2l second of 11 at the same venue four days ago over 2m1f (good to yielding); same mark here but different ground; chance if he handles it.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-17 over hurdles but knocking on the door in recent starts; has finished second under front-running rides here (16.5f, good) and at Limerick (2m, good) on last two starts; has run well on soft; should make a bold bid again.

Horse quote: 2023-03-13 at Thurles (16.5f): "Mahlers Cove loved the ground today and that was the key. He's disappointed me a bit, I thought he was going to be a better horse than he is.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 over hurdles; best effort came here over 2m4f on penultimate on soft ground when beaten 1.75l off 85; not as good latest upped to 2m7f in a handicap chase at Tramore; drops markedly in trip and reverts to hurdles; place claims.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over hurdles; well beaten first five starts but was in the process of showing a little bit more on latest at Naas (2m, good to yielding) when falling three out; locally trained and worth a 📊 market check.

🔦 Spotlight: Second reserve; dual-purpose maiden has shown glimmers of potential in a couple of his handicap hurdles, including in a first-time tongue tie at Naas last April and it is back on today; attracted market support on latest but ran poorly; worth a 📊 market check if gets a run.
