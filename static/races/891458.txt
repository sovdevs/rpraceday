🔦 Spotlight: Reappeared with a win at Southwell (1m, AW) last month; this course winner scored three times on turf last May-July and holds solid claims.
Horse quote: 2024-07-15 at Ayr (7f): "Makalu has turned around this year and he seems to be enjoying his racing now. I think he likes dropping in and staying on from the back and it gives him confidence. He's very gutsy when he does get there, he puts his head down and tries - James Sullivan, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who failed to build on his early promise for Brian Ellison and has finished last on his first two outings for this yard; a major turnaround is required in first-time headgear.
Horse quote: 2023-08-28 at Ripon (6f): "You don't know what to expect but I knew Power Of Zeus was a good athlete and in his first race he didn't know his backside from his elbow. He was tailed off then he improved and improved so I knew that there was a chance he'd do something but I'm shocked - in an extremely nice way. He might have a good future - Keith Brown, owner."
