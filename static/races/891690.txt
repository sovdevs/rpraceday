💬 Comment: Another fair run last time at Ascot behind one who was gifted an easy lead
🔦 Spotlight: Irish bumper winner; has hit the frame in all three runs over hurdles and the winner at Ascot last time made the most of a gifted lead (2m3f, good); this 6yo was noticeably strong in the market that day after wind surgery; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Given Flat ability his second in a modest Plumpton maiden was underwhelming
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time Flat winner and quite useful, so his second in a modest maiden hurdle at Plumpton was rather underwhelming (2m, good); could build on that but needs to.
Horse quote: 2024-07-10 at Kempton (AW) (11f): "Since God Of Fire joined the stable he's progressed nicely and grown in confidence. He did that really nicely and, subject to how he comes out of this, we'll likely target Monday (at Windsor) - Claire Kubler, winning trainer speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Went close in a 1m1f Leopardstown maiden (heavy) on debut but a well-held fifth over hurdles next time and didn't offer much in two runs back on the Flat; however, he has joined Harry Derham and that heightens interest.
