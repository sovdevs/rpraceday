🔦 Spotlight: Scored on nursery debut at Yarmouth (1m, good) in September and was third off today's mark on consecutive outings the following month (8.6f/1m); has fitness to prove after 147-day absence but further progress is possible over middle-distance trips this year.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up on last summer's debut but went the wrong way afterwards; back from a break
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up on last summer's Redcar debut (7f, good) but all three subsequent runs were disappointing; can be excused his heavy-ground defeat in October (handicap debut) but returns to action with quite a bit to prove.
