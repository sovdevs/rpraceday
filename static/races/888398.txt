🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice well beaten since a fair debut; improvement needed
🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise when third of eight on her Leicester debut (6f, good to firm) last July, but the form of that race didn't work out and she has been well beaten in two subsequent starts herself; hopes pinned on the switch to a handicap bringing about a resurgence; engaged 7.30 Newcastle Monday.
