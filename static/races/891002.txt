🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fifth in Birdcatcher Nursery here before going close in a Listed race at Newmarket
🔦 Spotlight: Sligo maiden winner; solid nursery form before going close in a 6f Listed race at Newmarket in November; finished fifth in the Birdcatcher Nursery over C&D (rallied after getting outpaced); her renewal of rivalry with Manhattan Chute (third) and Temperance (sixth) could be a key factor here.

💬 Comment: Should be spot-on for this following a Dundalk run, capable of making her presence felt
🔦 Spotlight: Chased home subsequent Listed winner Rebel Diamond over 6f on good-to-firm at Cork last September; 3lb out of the handicap when a staying-on sixth in the Birdcatcher; not without a chance in the rematch with Manhattan Chute and Kodilicious, since she has the advantage of a recent run behind a useful-looking newcomer at Dundalk.
