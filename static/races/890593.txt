💬 Comment: Just 1-11 over hurdles but looked back in good nick when second at Wincanton last month
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-11 over hurdles but looked back in good nick at Wincanton (2m4f, good) last month, coming from off the pace to finish second; won't be far away if in similar form.
Horse quote: 2024-05-12 at Ludlow (21.5f): "Jaxonne improved for the better ground and we're glad to have finally hit the nail on the head with him. We'll have a look and see if we can go again [under a penalty], he usually comes out of his races well - AJ O'Neill, joint-trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Placed on Irish point debut a year ago and on both hurdling starts this season, more recently when third of ten at Wetherby (2m3f, soft) in February; does not look harshly treated for this handicap debut and should be fine on the faster ground.
