🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor chase strike-rate & fell last time, but previous close 2nd represents appealing form
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-21 over fences and mistakes can be costly, as when an early faller recently; however, prior to that he went very close at Aintree (3m1f, soft) when clear with a 📈 progressive winner, and that's an appealing piece of form in the context of today's first veterans' chase assignment; likes it here.

🔦 Spotlight: Below her best this season but was a respectable fourth behind younger, 📈 progressive rivals when she wore first-time blinkers at Wincanton (3m2f, good to soft) last time; runs off the same mark today and could be in the shake-up if the first-time visor also has a positive impact.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor chase strike-rate & fell last time, but previous close 2nd represents appealing form
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-21 over fences and mistakes can be costly, as when an early faller recently; however, prior to that he went very close at Aintree (3m1f, soft) when clear with a 📈 progressive winner, and that's an appealing piece of form in the context of today's first veterans' chase assignment; likes it here.
