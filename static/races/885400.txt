🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor chase strike-rate & fell last time, but previous close 2nd represents appealing form
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-21 over fences and mistakes can be costly, as when an early faller recently; however, prior to that he went very close at Aintree (3m1f, soft) when clear with a 📈 progressive winner, and that's an appealing piece of form in the context of today's first veterans' chase assignment; likes it here.

🔦 Spotlight: 2-3 at Exeter and the return to this track offers a glimmer of hope; has the same mark as for his 9l win in this last year but he's failed to shine on either run this term and was pulled up last time; something to prove.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Respectable fourth behind younger, 📈 progressive rivals at Wincanton last time; a possible
🔦 Spotlight: Below her best this season but was a respectable fourth behind younger, 📈 progressive rivals when she wore first-time blinkers at Wincanton (3m2f, good to soft) last time; runs off the same mark today and could be in the shake-up if the first-time visor also has a positive impact.

🔦 Spotlight: 2-3 at Exeter and the return to this track offers a glimmer of hope; has the same mark as for his 9l win in this last year but he's failed to shine on either run this term and was pulled up last time; something to prove.

🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up the last twice, most recently at Newcastle in November, which was disappointing as he usually goes well when fresh in the autumn; however, he's on a competitive mark on last season's best form and this C&D winner could bounce back with a good run in his first veterans' chase.
