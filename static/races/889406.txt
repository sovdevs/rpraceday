🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Kept on well for second over C&D on this month's chasing debut; cheekpieces added today
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from long absence with two underwhelming hurdle runs this year, but kept on well for creditable second over C&D (good to soft) when switched to fences 16 days ago; will be a tough nut to crack if the first-time cheekpieces have any positive effect.

💬 Comment: Wide-margin winner last month; bumped into gambled-on 🚀 improver when second ten days ago

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seemingly aided by cheekpieces when twice running well in recent weeks
🔦 Spotlight: 0-17 under all codes but gave very good account before weakening into fourth of 15 at Carlisle (3m, soft; first-time cheekpieces) last month and was again running well before penultimate-fence fall here (2m4f, good) four weeks ago; contender if the new headgear continues to have a positive effect.
