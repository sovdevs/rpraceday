💬 Comment: In second and clear of two of these when unseating at the last flight at Haydock
🔦 Spotlight: Won well at Doncaster (good to soft) and was in a clear second when unseating late on at Haydock (soft; penalised); but for that mishap he would have been well ahead of Eagles Reprieve and The Resdev Tyke.
