🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sign of a return to form at former venue last month so considered
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent enough mare, winning 2m4f Thurles handicap and 2m3f Limerick novice earlier this season; signal of a return to form at former venue last month so considered.
Horse quote: 2024-11-29 at Thurles (20f): "The rain really helped Ad Caelum and she's an exciting mare for the future. Sean really fancied her and I was a bit concerned as she likes to get her toe in, but the ground has gone yielding which helped. She'll need soft ground and should be progressive in handicaps, or she could go to a rated novice hurdle - John Ryan, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive front-runner in 2022; foaled last year; market best guide after long absence
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive front-running mare in 2022, winning maiden here and 2m Gowran mares' Listed contest; out of depth when last seen in Grade 1 contest at Leopardstown in December 2022 and last year produced a foal; trip/ground to suit but market likely best guide after such an absence (9lb lower than last run).
Horse quote: 2022-09-30 at Gowran Park (16f): "We said we'd try and steal a march on them - if you're not brave you're nothing in life. Robbie gave She Is Electric a super ride. We always knew she was a decent filly - she had a few little problems early on - but she's a valuable filly now, a proper little one. She's a handicapper to jump, she'd jump out of jail for you - Norman Lee, trainer"
