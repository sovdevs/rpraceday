💬 Comment: Yet to win for this yard but well treated and AW reappearance second was encouraging
🔦 Spotlight: Well handicapped on the pick of his form and made a good return to action when second to next-time-out winner Midnight Lion at Newcastle (1m2f, AW) four weeks ago; given a chance to build on that promise.
Horse quote: 2022-06-10 at Sandown (10f): "I think it was a smart performance and we have put the wheels back on track. Lord Protector ran well at Chester last time but he was drawn wide and that is a tight turning track. He preferred running in a straight line today and he only just does enough. He came with a long sustained run but he didn't want to get there too soon. However, he pulled out a bit more when the other horse started coming at him - Eamonn O'Connor, owners' racing manager."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only one win in nearly three years but Doncaster return quite promising; C&D winner
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo with only one win (last May) in nearly three years now but he's 2lb below that last winning mark and his Doncaster reappearance wasn't devoid of promise, keeping on from the rear for sixth of 16 in a warm race; needs things to drop right but this former C&D scorer has to enter the reckoning.
Horse quote: 2022-05-06 at Chester (10.5f): ""I was delighted to see Amy's horse win yesterday [Pride Of America] as that boosted the form and Baryshnikov did it nicely at Pontefract. You need all the luck in the world to get the split on a horse like him. I had to ride for luck and I had the horse underneath me and when the gap came and he delivered nicely. He takes everything in his stride and has plenty of ability - Connor Beasley, jockey."

Horse quote: 2022-09-15 at Ayr (10f): "That was brilliant. Yorkshire Lady is so hardy. Serena Brotherton rides her out every day and she's come on no end for her last run when she was fourth at York and ran a blinder. Everyone keeps saying she wants soft ground but she just goes better on it when others don't - Jo Mason, jockey."
