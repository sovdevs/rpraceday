💬 Comment: Back-to-back winner over Dundalk's extended 1m2f, may improve on previous turf form
🔦 Spotlight: Arrives bidding for a hat-trick after back-to-back wins over Dundalk's extended 1m2f late last year; may improve on previous turf form, and definitely needs to, since his best placing was when seventh of 16 over C&D.

💬 Comment: Showed the benefit of a Dundalk win when scoring at Gowran, has to deal with 8lb rise
🔦 Spotlight: Showed the benefit of a Dundalk win when scoring at Gowran, his first success since May 2023 and fifth in all; has to deal with 8lb rise, same 7lb claimer rides.
Horse quote: 2025-04-16 at Gowran Park (9.5f): "Bringsty always jumps very well and he travelled very strongly into it. He took me everywhere and I did think I got there too soon but he kicked on again when I got stuck into him. He stayed well and I had a job pulling him up so a bit further or hurdles would be no harm to him either - Sam Coen, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Won a 1m Yarmouth handicap on good for the Crisfords last May; scored again at Southwell in August; poor effort on debut for Ger O'Leary at Dundalk but was slowly away and may have needed the run; again started slowly at Leopardstown, did well in the circumstances; live chance now with Nicola Burns claiming a valuable 7lb.

Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Sligo (10.5f): "Making the running seems to work for Don't Do Dramas. We would try him over a mile and a half again. It's a good stiff uphill finish here and he wasn't stopping. He handles soft ground well but I think he'll go on most ground, he mightn't want it firm - Mick Mulvany, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 3-27 on AW; modest strike rate on turf (1-27) makes it hard to be confident; sole turf win came at the main expense of Doctor Grace at Cork last May.
Horse quote: 2024-05-21 at Cork (10f): "He jumped out well, travelled well and never got hassled for the lead. Barretstown was doing an even enough gallop, took breathers when he could and kept responding. It's good when you have a willing partner like that - Billy Lee, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Wins have come on AW, Laytown and on quick ground on turf, going here may be too slow; disappointing at Laytown on final start before joining this yard.
Horse quote: 2022-09-08 at Laytown (7f): "Cordouan is a good horse. We bought him from Gosden's, he had not run for over 500 days. He's had a few bits of problems but hopefully we have ironed them out and you could see him in premier handicaps next year - Ado McGuinness, trainer."
