🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Makes plenty of appeal based on her handicap debut, form boosted by winner and third
🔦 Spotlight: Promising run in first-time tongue-tie when third in a Naas maiden hurdle in November; failed to reproduce that form in testing conditions on her next start; slotted into handicap company effectively at Naas six weeks ago, clear of subsequent winner Mercury Mission and losing out by a neck to Duke Of Leggagh who won his next race by 8l; big chance despite a 6lb rise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten favourite in a maiden last time, capable of reversing previous form with Kimy
🔦 Spotlight: Changed hands for a massive 500,000 euros after a wide-margin point win two seasons ago; beaten odds-on favourite in a 2m4f maiden hurdle at Leopardstown early this month; every chance now based on handicap debut at the same venue at DRF when only 0.75l behind runner-up Kimy.
