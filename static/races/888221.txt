🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two Irish points (3m, good/yielding) early last year; also placed in two bumpers and then off the mark on third start over hurdles (first run at 3m under rules) when winning a Ludlow maiden last time (good to soft); this looks tougher, but not out of it.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good 4th in Aintree Grade 1 last term; best form on soft ground so today's going not ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Started the season on a stiff mark having dead-heated for fourth in a Grade 1 novice at Aintree last April (3m, soft); best run this term when fourth in a 3m handicap at Ayr in January (soft); excuses for two lesser runs since; not sure today's quicker conditions are ideal.
