üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Needs to improve on his fifth at Leopardstown but possibly still a work in progress
üî¶ Spotlight: Stable last won this in 2016; won a traditionally warm bumper at Leopardstown over Christmas (yielding) and did his best work late in the day when beaten just over 3l in a Grade 2 there in February (soft; just behind Koktail Brut); the second and third horses last time didn't disgrace the form at Cheltenham, finishing seventh and eighth respectively (El Cairos was fifth); needs to find more, clearly, but that's feasible.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Needs to improve on his fifth at Leopardstown but possibly still a work in progress
üî¶ Spotlight: Stable last won this in 2016; won a traditionally warm bumper at Leopardstown over Christmas (yielding) and did his best work late in the day when beaten just over 3l in a Grade 2 there in February (soft; just behind Koktail Brut); the second and third horses last time didn't disgrace the form at Cheltenham, finishing seventh and eighth respectively (El Cairos was fifth); needs to find more, clearly, but that's feasible.
