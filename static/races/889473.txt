💬 Comment: His fifth at Cheltenham sets the standard and he could easily have finished closer
🔦 Spotlight: Recruited for 200,000euros after winning an Irish maiden point (3m, yielding) last April; won easily at Newbury (good) and held his own in the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham, finishing a 5l fifth but unlucky not to be closer (met with late interference); that form sets the standard and, seemingly not short of speed, this track should suit him well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all at Fontwell (won by 6l) but this will be a very different ball game
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth in a point bumper; showed the right attitude when making all for a 6l success at Fontwell (good to soft) but this is a very different ball game and he'll improve for longer trips further down the line.
