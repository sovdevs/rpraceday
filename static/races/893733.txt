Horse quote: 2023-09-02 at Navan (5f): "Step Back In Time got away with it today over the stiff five, she probably wants six. She ground it out really well. She has not been running badly and came out of the Cork race very well - Chris Timmons, trainer."

üí¨ Comment: Nine-time winner, two creditable 6f runs in March, no match for an easy winner at Naas
üî¶ Spotlight: Nine-time winner; well below best on last two Dundalk outings before returning to form with a long-priced fourth at the Curragh; no match for an easy winner at Naas, but had a few of these rivals behind, including subsequent winner Step Back In Time.
Horse quote: 2024-04-29 at Ayr (6f): "Catherine Chroi is a tough little filly and very consistent. She rarely runs a bad race so hopefully she can go out and win again at some point. It's harder to win in Ireland than it is here, but she enjoys being trained with us and we're picking the right type of races for her. She's thriving - Iain Jardine, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-07-15 at Navan (5f): "It's hard in Ireland in those lower grades as there are a lot of horses with not much between them. I think he's genuine enough.
