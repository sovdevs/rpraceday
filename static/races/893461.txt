🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising third behind a 1-2 shot on C&D debut (good) last month; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: His dam is out of a sister to stable's former star Cue Card; ran green on C&D debut (good; 12-1) last month but he made some good late headway to finish a 7l third of eight; that was a promising effort behind a 1-2 shot and he should know much more this time; 🔥 big player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stratford runner-up and had tough task at Ascot latest; respected back from a break
🔦 Spotlight: From a family her yard has done well with and she showed promise when second of five on Stratford debut (soft) in October; finished last of six at Ascot (1m7f, good) the following month but that was a good race and she ran well to a point; looks interesting back in calmer waters after a break and she's respected.
