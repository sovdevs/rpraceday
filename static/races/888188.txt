💬 Comment: Tailed off in a Grade 2 last time, but back in calimer water here; longer trip should suit
🔦 Spotlight: Made a successful hurdles/stable debut at Newbury (2m, soft) in December (first two clear), but finished a tailed-off last of six finishers behind East India Dock in a Grade 2 at Cheltenham (2m1f, soft) the following month; back in calmer waters here and, being a 2m winner on the Flat, this longer trip should suit; major player.

🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise over hurdles in France and when placed in his last two starts, at Fontwell (2m2f, soft) and in first-time cheekpieces at Ludlow (2m, good to soft); future may lie in handicaps, but he still holds each-way claims in this field.

🔦 Spotlight: Won an uncompetitive event on hurdles debut at Fontwell (2m2f, soft) in December, but with the long-odds-on favourite running poorly the form the form didn't amount to much; well held at Newbury (2m, soft; first-time hood) the following month and up against it here; cheekpieces return.
