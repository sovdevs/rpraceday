🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner; has run to similar level in three hurdles, finding a weak one at Wetherby (2m3f, good) before up against it at Catterick in December (first-time cheekpieces, retained); had wind surgery since; bred to appreciate this greater test; interesting handicap debutant.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark in good-ground 3m event at Ffos Las last May; was completing for only the second time since back from a break when a never-nearer fourth at Doncaster in January (hampered; only five hurdles jumped); just 2lb higher than the win and a potential 🚀 improver.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well held at Ascot latest but solid chance on earlier C&D form, in victory and defeat
🔦 Spotlight: Well held at Ascot last month but he won twice at 2m7f in December, including over C&D, and a strong-finishing third back over C&D (good to soft) in January was good form for the level; solid claims back down in grade.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten favourite latest but looks sure to find a race on close second over 3m in December
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden; beaten favourite when no match for peak-form rival over C&D last month but he'd been progressing nicely previously and shouldn't have any trouble finding a race on previous close third at Wetherby (3m, good to soft; first, fourth and fifth have won since); very likely to go well.
