🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Posted a solid effort when third at Southwell last time; cheekpieces now applied.
🔦 Spotlight: Better switched to handicaps, winning at Southwell (1m) in February off 3lb lower; didn't help his chance by hanging left over that same C&D 53 days ago but still posted a solid effort to finished third (runner-up won twice since); cheekpieces now and there could be better to come from him.

💬 Comment: 6lb higher than when winning on handicap debut over 7f in October; makes her AW debut.
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning handicap debut on heavy ground at Leicester (7f) off 6lb lower in October; makes her AW debut on this first outing since and will need to settle now upped to 8.5f (raced freely on a couple of occasions last year) but she's lightly raced and demands respect.

🔦 Spotlight: Sole win came here on handicap debut over 7f off 3lb lower in December; last two efforts have been creditable, though he did carry his head a bit awkwardly last time; still has it to prove over this trip (beaten 5l when fifth over C&D).
