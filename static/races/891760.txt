🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't lived up to expectations the last twice but is nicely bred and not written off
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French mare who hasn't lived up to expectations in two starts since Kempton win and was behind some of these opponents last time; however, she's very nicely bred and may yet resume progress; not written off.
Horse quote: 2024-12-26 at Kempton (16f): "Kientzheim is related to Epatante, so it's lovely as she's a sweet filly too. She jumped really well until they really kicked on, but she's a novice. She'll have to grow up a bit more, but I'd think she can go up to some nicer races now. This was a lovely race to start in - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Completed a hat-trick with Southwell success, beating some of these rivals; improving
🔦 Spotlight: Only 1-17 on Flat in Ireland but is building up a good strike-rate over hurdles for new stable; completed a hat-trick with Southwell success (2m) most recently, beating some of these rivals; improving.
Horse quote: 2022-07-30 at Galway (8.5f): "Serious Challenge is a lovely horse. The run earlier in the week brought him forward a lot. He's in the Futurity at the Curragh so that's probably where he'll go next - Una Manning, assistant trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Two novice wins in November and generally consistent otherwise; ties in with some of these rivals on Sandown (Imperial Cup) and Southwell form the last twice; solid contender who should give his running.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Wincanton (15f): "Sorceleur is a hardy horse and came out of Friday like he'd never been anywhere. I think I've had horses run on consecutive days six times and they've all won. He had a canter round at Exeter and he's won two nice pots. We won't run for a little while and look for a good race over Christmas - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

💬 Comment: All out at Huntingdon last time but has a smart pedigree and may do better still
🔦 Spotlight: Beat all bar a notable rival on hurdles debut; questionable whether he has improved in justifying favouritism twice since, all out at Huntingdon (2m) latest; however, has a smart pedigree and may do better still.
Horse quote: 2025-03-19 at Huntingdon (16f): "We had to come here to get another run into Wolf Moon to qualify for the novice championship handicap at Sandown next month, which is the last race of the season. He won't go up much for that and two miles around here was not ideal, but you can see he'll make a lovely chaser one day - Ben Pauling, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Solid operator, with form figures of 314 in bumpers and 212 over hurdles; ties in with some of these opponents on Southwell running last time; half-brother to smart Gidleigh Park and open to further progress.
Horse quote: 2025-03-22 at Newbury (16.5f): "John Barbour is full of ability but he's very quirky. When he won his first bumper he beat some lovely horses and then the next day didn't really go to plan. He then travelled and jumped all at Ludlow. If you could guarantee he could focus his mind he'd be a very good horse. Johnny [Burke] does a brilliant job on him. He's the sort of horse we might look at the Persian War with. We'll run him again because he needs experience, even if he's beaten - Fergal O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in a substandard Adonis is flanked by wins; this demands best form yet
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins apiece on Flat and under this code, notably in 4yo Listed hurdle; subsequently ran well in substandard Adonis then had a straightforward task at Stratford; this assignment demands best form yet.
Horse quote: 2025-02-01 at Musselburgh (15.5f): "St Pancras only ran a couple of weeks ago and we were anxious to get some more experience into him as quickly as possible as he's a lovely horse but just a bit novicey. We were wary even though it is a Listed race that I'd be waiting around until the end of February for some nice ground, so I'm glad we put him on the box with tomorrow's two runners. He did a lovely bit of work the other day and we're over the moon as that is our first Listed winner. We didn't think he'd have the pace of some of them as he probably wants further, but Kevin was patient and came with one good run - Toby Lawes, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-06-23 at Ascot (12f): "A huge run! What can I say, I am delighted. I thought at the furlong pole that Joseph's horse had got HMS President, and just for a second, that we might come back. Bar winning, I couldn't be happier with him - Alan King, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back in deeper waters and on a tough mark having gone up 15lb for penultimate effort
🔦 Spotlight: Good fourth in the Grade 1 juvenile hurdle at Aintree is flanked by wins that were straightforward tasks; returns to deeper waters and concedes weight all round having gone up 15lb for penultimate effort.
Horse quote: 2025-02-28 at Newbury (16.5f): "Apart from the last, Give It To Me OJ jumped well. He was going a bit left-handed, but that might have been because the front horse was going left-handed. Through no fault of his own he's had a messed up season, but he needed that run the other day when he was second - Gary Moore, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: French Flat form suggests he's capable of rating higher still over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Only 1-8 over hurdles but has a generally consistent record and two starts since wind surgery include the Taunton success (2m); French Flat form suggests he's capable of rating higher still in this sphere.
Horse quote: 2025-03-10 at Taunton (16.5f): "Fasol choked at Windsor last time so we had his wind done and he liked the better ground here. He'll have plenty of options during the spring - Paul Nicholls, trainer, talking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Juvenile hurdler whose limitations have been exposed the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Juvenile hurdler whose progress culminated in a share of the spoils (dead-heated) at Cheltenham in December; limitations seemingly exposed since, never dangerous in the Fred Winter last time.
Horse quote: 2024-12-14 at Cheltenham (17f): "Quantock Hills travelled through the race well and I think he's got a bright future. He wandered when he hit the front, this is a big place, but he's a good horse. He could be a Fred Winter and he'd be better on softer ground - Warren Greatrex, trainer."
