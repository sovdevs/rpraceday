🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: May have been fortunate to win twice over fences since December, but remains 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Has responded well to headgear and is 2-4 over fences (both wins over 3m on soft ground) since returning from a year off in November, but he was fortunate to win those races as in each case his main danger made a complete mess of the final fence; shapes like a real stayer an remains 🔍 unexposed as a chaser, so not discounted.

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 7yo; this longer trip should suit and he probably still has plenty more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: 🔍 unexposed 7yo who has already shown himself a dour stayer, as when winning on his return from six months off at Carlisle (3m2f, good to soft) in October; drying ground could pose a question, but the longer trip should suit and he probably still has plenty more to offer.

🔦 Spotlight: Last four wins have come on good ground as when rallying gamely to just land a conditional jockeys' veterans' chase at Doncaster (3m) a week ago; 1-1 around here and respected off the same mark as last time, especially if conditions continue to dry out.
