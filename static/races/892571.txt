🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner; best over this trip but prefers testing conditions; never a factor here latest
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner; best over this trip but prefers testing conditions; got a run on the inside when winning at Navan (5f, yielding) off 80 in October; never a factor over C&D when last seen 160-days ago; others preferred.
