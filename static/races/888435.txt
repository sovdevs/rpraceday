🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor draw when sixth on handicap debut two weeks ago; should stay 7f; still of interest
🔦 Spotlight: Lost his unbeaten AW record at Lingfield on his handicap debut two weeks ago but he was poorly drawn and caught wide throughout; should stay today's extra furlong and likely this mark will be in range; contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two good runs at Newcastle last month, winning a weak maiden latest; 3lb rise seems harsh
🔦 Spotlight: Close third in a 1m handicap at Newcastle last month and he didn't have to improve on that to win a maiden back over that C&D 12 days later; beat an unconsidered 100-1 shot there and a 3lb rise seems harsh but he is at least in form.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 as a 2yo but ran to a useful level on a couple of occasions; last seen finishing in midfield in a deep sales race at York's Ebor meeting (6f; cheekpieces first time); return to 7f won't hurt; more appealing than many on her AW debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two course wins, including over this trip; not so good in handicaps the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins have come at Southwell, the latest in a C&D novice in November; two handicap runs leave him with something to find.

💬 Comment: Standout effort came in a small-field heavy-ground event; others look better handicapped
🔦 Spotlight: Landed the odds in a 7f Musselburgh maiden last August on his fifth start; better form when second at Ffos Las 12 days later (7.5f, heavy); last of six in a Kempton nursery when last seen in September; change of headgear this time but he doesn't look well handicapped.
