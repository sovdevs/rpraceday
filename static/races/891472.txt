🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Newbury winner last summer and fourth in a Newmarket Group 3; back in much calmer waters
🔦 Spotlight: Well supported when making a winning debut at Newbury (6f, good) last July and was pitched in at the deep end when contesting a Group 3 at Newmarket (7f, good to soft) in October, although she acquitted herself well in finishing fourth of ten; back in much calmer waters on return; major claims.
