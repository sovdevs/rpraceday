💬 Comment: Placed all four hurdling starts and has good chance to get off the mark here
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who has been placed on all four hurdling starts; arguably showed his best form when third of 12 at Southwell (2m, good to soft) last month, and will be fine over the longer trip here; good chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten on last month's hurdling debut; this race is easier but he still looks risky
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in 15-runner Kempton bumper (good to soft) last March but well beaten in heavy-ground bumper later that month and again when reappearing in soft-ground Newbury hurdle (2m4f) in February; this race is easier than last time and the drying ground may suit him better but, nevertheless, he needs to take a big step forward.
