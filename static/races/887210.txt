🔦 Spotlight: Four hurdle wins, the latest in November 2023; switched to chasing this season, running creditably in the second and latest of his four attempts; had wind surgery (his second) after a poor show on penultimate outing; solid prospects if his latest effort (runner-up over an extended 2m3f on soft at Wetherby) is repeated.

💬 Comment: Second in two 2m handicaps before his flop when favourite at Hereford (upped to 2m5f)
🔦 Spotlight: Two hurdle wins and better form when second over fences in December in 2m handicaps at Warwick and Newbury, both on good to soft; short-headed in the latter but flopped when favourite at Hereford (upped to 2m5f) six weeks ago, when having three runs in just over a month was blamed; stamina to prove beyond 2m2f, even if he's back to form; yard is going strongly.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three races, two in Britain; chase debut and he's 7lb lower than on handicap/British debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m1f hurdle race at Nantes in October 2023; sold for 85,000euros that November but well beaten off apparently stiff marks when next seen this December in two handicap hurdles in Britain; goes chasing today and he's 7lb lower than on handicap/British debut; on pedigree, he's likely to stay.
