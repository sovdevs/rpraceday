💬 Comment: May have bounced at Haydock; returned with good 2nd previously; major player on that form
🔦 Spotlight: May have bounced when pulled up on heavy ground at Haydock in December on second start back from a long absence, and he's had wind surgery since; prior to that he reappeared with a good second at Ludlow (3m1f, good to soft) and is a major player if rediscovering that form; has won on soft.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the Grand Military Gold Cup over C&D three weeks ago and can give another good account
🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent but ran well in the military races over C&D early last year and he beat Farceur Du Large by just over 1l in the Grand Military Gold Cup over C&D (soft) three weeks ago; now 5lb worse off with the runner-up but can give another good account under regular rider Captain Douglas White.
