🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good 2nd over C&D on last month's reappearance; lower draw preferred but each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: Hardy sprinter who made a pleasing return to action over C&D last month; 1lb rise shouldn't prevent another good run; not ideally drawn but less to prove than many of these.
Horse quote: 2023-09-29 at Haydock (5f): "William (Pyle) said Curious River took him there and did it easily. He's won a couple of races now and seems to be getting quicker - Katie Scott, trainer."

💬 Comment: Capable off this mark but he wasn't at his best back on turf ten days ago; yard run two
🔦 Spotlight: Capable off this mark; never in the hunt at Epsom on his return to turf ten days ago; others appeal more for win purposes; yard run two.
Horse quote: 2024-01-20 at Lingfield (AW) (5f): "One Night Stand is a horse who, when you get him to the front, can get a breather from the three to the two and slingshot off the bend, and I probably nicked it there - Kieran O'Neill, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: On a losing run and he has done all his winning over further; shaped well at Southwell on his return to action in February but he hasn't built on it twice since; opposable back at 5f and from the widest stall.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Smart in his prime; on a dangerous mark and should leave last month's return well behind
🔦 Spotlight: Smart on turf and AW in his prime and he is likely to exploit his big drop in the weights at some point soon; dropped away at Southwell last month on his first run for 350 days; likely to last longer today; could go well at a price.
Horse quote: 2022-05-12 at York (5f): "There were worries about turning out so quickly, he's always sore the day after he runs, going back to the first time I ran him. It was a good run at Hamilton and I had no intention of declaring him but I trotted him up and he was like a dressage horse, he was absolutely perfect so I had to declare him. That is by far his most impressive performance to date. You've got to keep sprinters going when they're in this sort of form because they can soon drop out of it and the Dash is the next target. I've been speaking about it for months, we've been second and third and I'd love to win it. It's a very hot race and it doesn't suit every horse, rolling down a hill, but Fine Wine is so quick and he almost broke the track record at Southwell - Scott Dixon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four wins last year, two over C&D, but was a remote last here on her recent return
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins in a productive 2024 campaign, two of them over C&D; 80-1 and finished last of 12 on her return to action here 13 days ago; needs to leave that well behind her.
