🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner; up another 4lb for getting beat last time but he's firmly in the  mix
🔦 Spotlight: Went up 10lb for winning by 18l over 2m3f here (soft) when in first-time cheekpieces but still ran well at Bangor (3m, soft) and the winner was second to a well-handicapped rival at Hereford on Sunday; could have done without another 4lb but he's in the mix.
