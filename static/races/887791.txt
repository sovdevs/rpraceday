💬 Comment: Confirmed last season's promise with Clonmel maiden win, big chance on Punchestown running
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; chased home smart Bioluminescence on hurdles debut at Punchestown last winter; highly tried on final start last season; wide-margin Clonmel maiden winner in November having been left clear two out; creditable second at Punchestown two months ago, winner Hey Sunshine is a good yardstick.

💬 Comment: Stays further than this though the extended 3m stretched her stamina at Cork, good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner in 2023 and dual winner over hurdles at up to 2m7f this season; good effort again in a 2m5f Listed contest at Limerick in October; failed to stay as effectively as two of her rivals in a Grade 3 event over an extended 3m at Cork; this demanding 2m4f should suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner for Ellen Doyle at Kildorrery last season; changed hands for 110,000GBP at Cheltenham; beat a well-exposed horse in a 2m maiden here in December, surviving a late mistake; will need to jump much more cleanly than when a moderate fourth at Fairyhouse.

💬 Comment: Limitations exposed since Cork maiden win, jumping was an issue at Down Royal
🔦 Spotlight: Overcame some greenness to win 2m4f Cork maiden hurdle in November; failed to rise to the occasion in C&D Grade 3 event two weeks later; jumping was an issue when a beaten favourite in a four-runner race over a shorter trip at Down Royal; winner Disco Dancer has since run well in a good handicap.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in three of her four bumper starts for John McConnell; has maintained consistency since going over hurdles and deserved her maiden win from Swing Davis (disappointing sort) at Fairyhouse last month; likely to find a few too good here.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in three of her four bumper starts for John McConnell; has maintained consistency since going over hurdles and deserved her maiden win from Swing Davis (disappointing sort) at Fairyhouse last month; likely to find a few too good here.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner for Ellen Doyle at Kildorrery last season; changed hands for 110,000GBP at Cheltenham; beat a well-exposed horse in a 2m maiden here in December, surviving a late mistake; will need to jump much more cleanly than when a moderate fourth at Fairyhouse.

💬 Comment: Limitations exposed since Cork maiden win, jumping was an issue at Down Royal
🔦 Spotlight: Overcame some greenness to win 2m4f Cork maiden hurdle in November; failed to rise to the occasion in C&D Grade 3 event two weeks later; jumping was an issue when a beaten favourite in a four-runner race over a shorter trip at Down Royal; winner Disco Dancer has since run well in a good handicap.
