🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Hereford latest; this match is on unfavourable terms but his rival has lost his way
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who was useful in his prime; has unseated twice this winter but he capitalised on a reduced mark when justifying favouritism at Hereford (3m1f, soft) in February; concedes plenty of weight to a rival with the same official rating but he's in form after that smooth win, while Stormin Crossgales has lost his way.
Horse quote: 2025-02-23 at Hereford (25f): "I thought Champagnesuperover would win the last day and he unseated. He's not the force of old but he'd come back down to a mark where he could be competitive and he's still genuine and still has an appetite for racing, when plenty of older horses don't. He's come back down to a grade where he can be competitive and I wasn't surprised to see him win. He had a tendon injury which put him out for 18 months and a lot of horses don't come back the same from that - Olly Murphy, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has lost his way but this is a good opportunity on these terms if he can get back on track
🔦 Spotlight: Made pretty much all to win back-to-back handicaps at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) and Southwell (2m4f, soft) this winter, the latter in a small field but by 35l; has lost his way since, including with two pulled-up efforts, but this is a good opportunity on these terms if he can get back on track.
Horse quote: 2025-01-01 at Southwell (20.5f): "That was brilliant - if Noel Fehily doesn't send us a horse now, he never will! We got Stormin Crossgales for 5,000GBP from Doncaster Sales, and it's taken a bit of time to get to know him. I kept the headgear on for a while as that's what he had on before, but taking it off has really worked. His jumping is key, and that's what wins races for him. To jump and stay 2m4f on that ground is unbelievable - Adam Pogson, joint trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
