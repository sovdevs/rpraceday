🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed at Catterick since C&D win in December; 🔥 big player if this quicker ground suits
🔦 Spotlight: Built upon promising chase debut when beating Old Page and Prince Cleni over C&D (soft) in December and posted another good effort when third at Catterick (3m1f, soft) in January; needs to prove himself on faster ground but could still have more to offer over fences.

📝 Comment: didn't always jump with fluency, in touch with leaders, lost ground before 12th, dropped to last before 4 out, headway before 3 out, weakening when lost position after 2 out (trainer said, regarding the poor form shown, that he felt that run may have come too soon for gelding, having run 10 days ago)
