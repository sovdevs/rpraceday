🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten at Newbury recently but a 🔥 big player if judged on this season's course form
🔦 Spotlight: Placed twice over C&D (good) in November before winning here (2m3f, good to soft) the following month; needs to rebound from 31l defeat at Newbury four weeks ago but is sure to be suited by today's return to Ascot, and his current mark is workable.

🔦 Spotlight: Looked as good as ever when winning from off the pace at Uttoxeter (2m, good to soft) last summer but we haven't seen him since a disappointing hurdle run in November and he'll need to be back in prime form to pose a threat off current mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very well handicapped on old form but yet to click for new stable this season
🔦 Spotlight: Very well handicapped on old form but, following a long absence, has not really fired on any of four starts for new stable this season; will find this race easier than Grand Annual at Cheltenham this month but still has quite a bit to prove.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on his last winning mark and sure to be suited by today's return to good ground
🔦 Spotlight: In career-best form last spring, notably when winning by 6l off today's mark at Warwick (2m, good to firm); well beaten three consecutive times (twice over hurdles) on soft ground since December but will be much better suited by the underfoot conditions here; must be considered.
