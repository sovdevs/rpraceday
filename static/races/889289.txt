üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Latest win over 1m1f at Gowran last spring; hasn't been  cracking it on AW for üÜï new yard
üî¶ Spotlight: Three Flat wins in Ireland, most recently over about 1m1f at Gowran (soft) last spring, but although he won twice on Polytrack in his home country he hasn't been cracking it on AW for this yard; has come down the weights, but not by much, and needs a turnaround for the return to turf.
