💬 Comment: Disappointed second start after finishing fourth in a Listed race on debut; watch market
🔦 Spotlight: Both starts at York last year, making a fine debut when fourth of 15 in a Listed event (5f, good) in May but failing to beat a rival in a novice (6f, good to firm) in July; off eight months, but she is related to AW winners and her sire is 29-158 (+£87.72 to a £1 stake) here in the past five seasons; watch market.
