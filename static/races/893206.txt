Horse quote: 2023-08-20 at Tramore (16f): "Boskill Borden ran here in June and he seemed to handle the track. He's a very professional horse and nothing bothers him. There might be another one in him - Paul Fahey, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Exposed four-time hurdle winner who ideally wants good ground and despite favourable conditions he was twice well held in March after a break; the return of blinkers (for cheekpieces) is no bad thing but likely one for another day.
Horse quote: 2020-08-13 at Salisbury (12f): "Iron Heart has worked smartly and ran good at Newmarket last time behind a progressive sort. Hopefully he'll go on to better things - Oisin Murphy, jockey."
