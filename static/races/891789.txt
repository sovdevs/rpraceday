🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Suited by the return to AW last autumn, winning three times; now 5-9 in this sphere
🔦 Spotlight: Suited by the return to AW last autumn, winning three times (including over C&D) and taking overall record in this sphere to 5-9; respected, assuming she returns from layoff in the same form.
Horse quote: 2024-09-04 at Kempton (AW) (6f): "We went pretty hard and the plan was not to go there too soon on Coup De Force. The race worked out perfectly. She travelled exceptionally well and I was confident turning in, she took me into the race nicely, and although she had a little look in front she was always going to get over the line - Kieran Shoemark, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Disappointing dropped to 6f last time but this return to Kempton may prove a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful 7f handicapper who has shaped as if 6f is worth exploring; disappointing when dropped to this trip at Wolverhampton last time but gained sole handicap win at Kempton and could well fare better back here; on an attractive mark and worth another chance.
Horse quote: 2024-03-02 at Kempton (AW) (7f): "I think the gelding (operation) has helped and a bit of a break and Giant has come back fresh and well. Everything went to plan and he's done it nicely - Richard Spencer, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Fighting chance off current mark provided she transfers turf form back to AW
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time turf winner, most recently off 1lb higher last June; ended her 2024 campaign with a pair of second-place finishes; fighting chance provided she's as effective back on AW (third attempt).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has an unconvincing record on AW and can be opposed in this grade
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a Class 6 hat-trick on soft/heavy ground last October; has an unconvincing record on AW and can be opposed in this grade.
Horse quote: 2023-10-11 at Nottingham (6f): "I took a bit of a gamble and ran World Of Darcy at Newmarket over seven furlongs because I felt that now's the time to decide what we're going to do with him. Luke [Morris, jockey] said drop him back to six and get him a bit of confidence because he's obviously had a few hard days at work and we picked this one. There's nothing wrong with him, but he's not very big. There's always going to be a doubt whether this horse trains on, but at the moment he eats well and works well. There's a winter campaign and I think that's what I'm aiming for. We've got a big entry at the weekend, but we'll look at that and decide what the ground does. We'll see how he recovers and then we'll make decisions - John Ryan, trainer."
