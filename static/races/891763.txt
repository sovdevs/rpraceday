🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5lb rise may underestimate C&D win and he could also be 🚀 open to further improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Solid record at Sandown was enhanced when he scored in good style over C&D (good) seven weeks ago, leading three out to get off the mark as a chaser at the fifth attempt; 5lb rise may underestimate that and he could also be 🚀 open to further improvement; big shout.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Surged back to form, never better, for a quickfire double (Ayr and Cheltenham) recently
🔦 Spotlight: Surged back to form, in fact never better, for wins over the extended 2m4f at Ayr (good to soft) and Cheltenham (good) five days later; came from off the pace in both and scored with rather more authority than the margin suggests last time, so he remains one to be seriously interested in (raised another 3lb) going for a hat-trick in space of just over two weeks.
Horse quote: 2025-04-16 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "I always had this race in mind and, in current times, I thought we'd better run again. It's worked out really well. Riskintheground will run on the last day of the season at Sandown - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Highly 📈 progressive for 🆕 new yard this season, winning three times and better form when runner-up on last two outings; his last six have been at about 2m6f-3m and it's also a while since he raced on good ground; also edging up the weights but he still looks a leading contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Emphatic win at Musselburgh; 25-1, not disgraced in mid-division at Cheltenham Festival
🔦 Spotlight: Two disappointing runs before he resumed improvement with an emphatic win at Musselburgh (2m4f) in February, for which he's 7lb higher today; not disgraced when 25-1 in mid-division at the Cheltenham Festival (near 2m5f, also on good to soft) and good ground should be fine; not dismissed.
Horse quote: 2023-11-10 at Exeter (16.5f): "We've won this with some nice horses and Insurrection looked really good. We've always thought a lot of him. He had a breathing op and we wanted to see him go and do that today. He bowled along in front and sprinted from the last. We could go down a similar route to Tahmuras and end up in what was the Tolworth. He's a talented horse - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won twice over an extended 2m4f at Kempton before pulled up over the big fences at Aintree
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French 6yo, somewhat frustrating in Britain before the blinkers went on for last four starts and he won twice over an extended 2m4f at Kempton (good ground the first time); pulled up over the big fences at Aintree on latest, which can probably be forgiven and he's still on a competitive mark.
Horse quote: 2025-03-15 at Kempton (20.5f): "Bad didn't miss a beat today, he's always been very economical with his jumping. He was very unfortunate to fall at Ascot when he was going very well, but today was deeper race than the last day. We went a good gallop from the start and it probably worked out better for him, because I had a lead for longer. Once I got upsides Tristan [Durrell on Flegamatik] coming down to the last, I didn't know how much my lad wanted it, but he had a good jump and I just held on. It was do or die at the last. If I missed it and Tristain winged it, he was going to win, and vice versa. That's what won it for us in the end but he has loads of ability. He's one of the yard favourites and a hell of a character at home, so for him to get his head in front twice now, it's brilliant. If he gets out of bed on the right side then he's got loads and loads in hand - the days he doesn't want to do it then he won't - Ben Jones, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Has raced only on softer than good; 2m3f hurdle winner in France in May 2023; minor honours in six of seven British starts, the exception when he bled here on penultimate outing; rallying third of 14 under Tom Broughton at Aintree (2m) latest and may now be worth this second attempt at about 2m4f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: New stable for last two starts and won them both, from the front in small-field handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: New stable for last two starts and he won them both, from the front in small-field handicaps over an extended 2m6f at Leicester (good to soft) and Stratford (good); hit a new high last time, doing it comfortably off 3lb lower than today, and he's on a roll but this race is much more competitive.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Stratford (22.5f): "Mahons Glory is great, isn't he? He gets in a rhythm out in front from fence to fence and is such a nice horse to ride. I thought with the two fences being dolled off it might cost us a bit, but he travels out on his own and loves it. It rode slow enough on the chase course, which helped. He seems to have lumped 12st round there nicely, so hopefully Dylan can find an opportunity somewhere to try and pick up a nice prize - Lee Edwards, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Solid most of this term; put firmly in his place in Grade 1s; this also needs career best
🔦 Spotlight: Last season over hurdles ended on a low note at this meeting; solid for most of this term, switched to fences for last five starts and winning twice in small fields; put firmly in his place in Grade 1 novice events over 2m4f here in February and particularly at Aintree last time, but this return to a handicap will also demand a career best.
Horse quote: 2024-12-20 at Ascot (19f): "Mark Of Gold is a good horse and we were quite confident coming here. It's a big thing to do first time over fences as Ascot is a tricky track to jump round, but it was a small field and it was like running in a normal novice chase. You used to be able to get them, but you can't get them anymore and you'd rather start him and give him a good experience. He's done that and picked up a big prize. The aim was to go to Plumpton on January 5, but I'm not sure we'll do that now. We could still do it, but we'll have to seriously consider him over fences now as he took to them so well - Josh Moore, joint-trainer."
