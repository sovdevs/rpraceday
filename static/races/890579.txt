🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive type; won pluckily at Newcastle latest; big shout with form working out well
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive type and he pluckily resumed winning ways in handicap chase at Newcastle (2m4f) last month; up 3lb but big shout with that form having been well advertised since.
Horse quote: 2024-12-26 at Wetherby (19.5f): "We always thought Empty Nest was quite a decent horse and he never quite put it together on the track. He's been frustrating and we thought about retirement but we took him to Malton and he worked really well. I'm not sure what's made the difference but something has definitely worked - Mark Walford, trainer."
