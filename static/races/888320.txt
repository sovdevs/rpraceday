🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some good runs here this term despite jumping to the right, but he's 5lb wrong today
🔦 Spotlight: Won over C&D (good) in November and 10l second of four to rejuvenated winner over C&D (good) last Tuesday; achieved those results despite jumping to the right at this left-handed venue; however, he's 5lb out of the handicap today and needs something extra if he's to add to his sole win.

🔦 Spotlight: 11yo whose form has deteriorated and he's without a win since November 2022; however, he wasn't disgraced in a 2m4f handicap hurdle 16 days ago on his second stable start and the step back up in trip and return to fences are in his favour; not discounted off dangerous mark.
