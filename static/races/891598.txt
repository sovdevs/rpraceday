🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Could be better for reappearance, the drop in grade and this return to further.
🔦 Spotlight: Has shown glimpses of ability but been unable to capitalise, his best effort being over 7f at Haydock (good to firm) last August; was probably a bit too free on his reappearance; could be better for that run, the drop in grade and this return to further but has that to prove.

🔦 Spotlight: Dead heated for first (9.5f, AW) on her nursery debut last September, before taking a couple of backward steps; resumes back on her proper mark but needs to have improved to defy it.
