🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive surge to the front at Southwell (5f) latest; up 6lb but looks 📈 progressive
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well on good to firm at Newmarket last May; gained his first handicap win when surging to the front in the final furlong in a 5f handicap at Southwell three weeks ago; 6lb rise against stronger opposition asks a stiffer question but it is highly likely he has more to offer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Travels strongly; continued progress at Beverley ten days ago; ⬆️ up in class; softer ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Made fine progress last year while leaving the impression there was still a fair bit more in the tank; endured a miserable run through on his Doncaster return but had no problem justifying favouritism in a 5f Beverley handicap ten days ago; 4lb rise less of a concern than quicker ground and deeper opposition; likely he's up to this level but would be more appealing on slower than good.
Horse quote: 2025-04-16 at Beverley (5f): "Trilby shows nothing at home. He's so laid-back for a sprinter. He's a pleasure to deal with and, because he's so easy and rideable, he just saves himself, which is great. He's been a great horse for us so far, so anything else he achieves is a bonus. He likes Haydock, and we all like a day out at York, so fingers crossed we'll keep tipping away with him. It will be fun to see what the season brings - Sam England, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive 3yo, including a C&D win; still low mileage but slower ground seems ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins as a 3yo, including C&D and a big sprint handicap at Newmarket's July meeting; creditable effort behind Strike Red at York when last seen in October; ✂️ gelded since; may well improve again this year but ground softer than good does seem to be the key to him.

💬 Comment: Had some high-class handicap form last year; sharper for reappearance; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Had some smart handicap form last year, placed at Royal Ascot and twice at Glorious Goodwood (including third in the Stewards' Cup); 3lb lower today and he should be sharper with his Doncaster reappearance behind him; best form on good to firm.
Horse quote: 2023-07-01 at Doncaster (6f): "I was so green in the first half of the race but once he kind of got himself straightened up in the last furlong and a half, he really put his head down and showed a good attitude. Billyjoh loved the ground, he never missed a foot on it. I don't think he's beaten a bad field there and being so green, I think you have to kind of upgrade that as well - Frederick Larson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Won a big-field sprint at York last October (6f, soft); needs to leave reappearance behind
🔦 Spotlight: Usually manages to bag at least one nice prize a year and in 2024 it was a valuable York sprint in October (6f, soft; strong form); low-key return to action at Southwell three weeks ago and may need a bit more weight off his back.
Horse quote: 2024-10-12 at York (6f): "Strike Red had a bad injury last year that you wouldn't really see on Flat horses and more on jumpers. He's been better than ever this year and this worked out easily enough. I always told Richard [Fahey, trainer] he feels like a Group horse and he's a top-end handicapper. There's plenty still to look forward to - Billy Garritty, jockey."

💬 Comment: High-class in his heyday; on downgrade last year but a fire still burned; may need this
🔦 Spotlight: Two-time Stewards' Cup winner; no win since 2023 where he won a Group 3 and twice in Listed company; did run some fair races in defeat last year though and he's not handicapped out of things on even his 2024 best; he has needed the run on his reappearance in recent times though.
Horse quote: 2023-09-10 at York (6f): "Commanche Falls has been better than ever. He did well to win at Newbury because the ground was against him and Ireland last time came too soon, but the horse that beat him [Moss Tucker] just won the big sprint [Flying Five]. He probably ran better than we thought there. He's in a few races, including at the Curragh again, but the ground is important to him. He won't run a lot more this season as he's done so well - Michael Dods, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flopped at Newcastle eight days ago but in a messy race; lower mark on turf; visor back on
🔦 Spotlight: Disappointed at Newcastle on Good Friday but that was a race in which little got into it from off the pace and he shouldn't be judged too harshly on it; infrequent turf winner but he's on a lowly mark in this sphere and 6f on good ground no problem; visor goes on for the first time since joining Tim Easterby; not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2024-03-29 at Newcastle (AW) (6f): "Today it all came together and hopefully it will be the beginning of a decent season for Fivethousandtoone. He was good last time and better today - Oisin Murphy, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sharper for Newbury return; this mark looks within range on 2024 best; each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: Did well for Ruth Carr in the second half of 2024 and still has some handicapping scope; closely matched with Havana Pusey on their Newbury meeting but that opponent had the benefit of a recent run; each-way shout.
