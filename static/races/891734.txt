🔦 Spotlight: Won by 8l at Doncaster in November (2m, good) and was in the process of returning to form until losing a winning chance with a late blunder at Carlisle; not proven over this far but this might not be too stern a test of stamina.

🔦 Spotlight: Has won two soft-ground handicaps at Leicester (2m4f/2m6f) this winter and it was a Class 2 in which the hat-trick bid came up well short at Uttoxeter; had a break since then and should be a factor at this level.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor last time but his second to Lowry's Bar at Exeter in December reads well
🔦 Spotlight: An 11yo who wasn't at the races last time at Newbury but was running fairly well prior to that, with a second to Lowry's Bar at Exeter in December (2m3f; stays 3m+) a commendable effort; hard to dismiss.
Horse quote: 2024-03-19 at Exeter (19f): "We had some problems with Stormy Flight last season and spent a fortune with the vets but since then he's run very well. I thought that was up there with his best runs over fences so I'm absolutely delighted - Jeremy Scott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Record of 2-9 over fences; none too consistent and disappointed at Lingfield last time (2m4f, heavy) in a race he won the previous season; it could be he resented the new blinkers and cheekpieces return; big shout off this mark if bringing his best game.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy winner of an Irish handicap hurdle 12 months ago; absent since and 0-6 as a chaser
🔦 Spotlight: Longstanding maiden under rules until running out a clearcut winner over hurdles at Downpatrick when last seen 12 months ago, where the good ground made a difference and perhaps the new cheekpieces (joining a tongue-tie); whether he can replicate that form back over fences (0-6) after a year out is debatable.
