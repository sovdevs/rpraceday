🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Overcame inexperience to make winning debut at Southwell; should go well under a penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Quite a classy pedigree, and he overcame inexperience to make winning debut at Southwell (7f) in November, staying on from off the pace to lead close home; bred to stay at least this far; open to improvement and should go well under a penalty.
