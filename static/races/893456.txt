🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up over 3m4f at Leopardstown and assured stamina will be no bad thing here
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly-raced maiden but surely a winner waiting to happen over fences and he saw the trip out well when runner-up on handicap debut (chasing) over 3m4f at Leopardstown in early March; assured stamina will be no bad thing here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Punchestown winner in Dec (2m3f); lots more to offer, especially at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Improving 7yo who made it 2-4 over fences when comfortably accounting for Rolly Bowley Boy over 2m3f at Punchestown in late December (soft; 10-11f); was running well when falling on his last attempt at 3m; appeals as a horse with lots more to offer.
Horse quote: 2024-12-31 at Punchestown (19.5f): "Folly Master is a lovely horse, very straightforward and genuine. He wants proper soft ground and maybe another mile. He could be one for a bigger day in the spring - Tom Dreaper, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in this 12 months ago; encouraging signs in the Leinster National latest
🔦 Spotlight: Chased home handicap snip Macdermott in this 12 months ago when 5lb lower and nearly won a Listed chase next time at Punchestown; effectively just his second run of this campaign when staying on into sixth in the Leinster National; big run expected under conditions that are right up his street.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has the form to feature and the return of blinkers might not be a bad thing
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up to smart opposition in his first two chases before beating the useful High Class Hero at Punchestown (3m, yielding); nothing positive to take from his last three races (all good ones; two handicaps) but the ability is there to feature off this mark (with Rob James taking off 7lb) and the return of blinkers might not be a bad thing.
Horse quote: 2024-12-31 at Punchestown (24f): "Shannon Royale is a good galloping type and a good staying type. He is more of a handicapper than a graded horses. He jumped well in the main and was just wasn't doing a lot in front - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has yet to reproduce his best form over fences, though didn't run badly over 3m3f at Punchestown before a lot went wrong in the Kim Muir (interfered with more than once); still only a 7yo and having his sixth run over fences.
Horse quote: 2024-01-28 at Naas (18.5f): "Cleatus Poolaw is a chaser in the making, what he does over hurdles will be a bonus. He could step right up to 3m - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lost his way after impressing in a chase last season; young enough to get back on track
🔦 Spotlight: Impressive winner of a Listed handicap chase at Naas last February (2m4f, soft to heavy) before losing his way; a recent run over hurdles might have done him good and he's still only a 7yo; 8lb higher than for that last win but this mark shouldn't be beyond him.
Horse quote: 2024-02-25 at Naas (20f): "Battle It Out had a nice light weight and it was a proper test whcih is what he wants. He'll be a lovely horse next year, he is still only a frame - Conor O'Dwyer, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Quite a stylish winner of this two years ago when 5lb higher but lightly raced in the meantime and mostly disappointing, especially this campaign; cheekpieces didn't do a lot for him last time.
Horse quote: 2022-01-22 at Navan (20f): "I'm delighted with Macs Charm, he stays at it really well. He's a 3m horse in time and I suppose he proved that today. He's in again on Thursday but I'm not sure whether we'll go to war with him again so quick but it's an option. We'll look for something similar otherwise - Colm Murphy, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fell two runs back and may have been remembering that when never really going at Navan
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up on his comeback run (3m) and was going well when falling four out next time; may have been remembering that fall when pulled up at Navan as he was slow at the first and steadily lost his position when things hotted up.
Horse quote: 2023-01-15 at Punchestown (22.5f): "Salmanino was entitled to win that and it was the ideal race for him. He'll go for staying handicaps now and thank goodness for this type of race - Liz Doyle, trainer."

💬 Comment: Dual chase winner who will enjoy the ground but doesn't arrive here in the best of form
🔦 Spotlight: Dual chase winner who will enjoy the ground but he never counted in the Leinster National and then faded away in the new cheekpieces at Downpatrick; asking a lot to bounce back in this good handicap.
Horse quote: 2021-01-31 at Naas (20.5f): "Stormy Judge stayed on really well today and three miles will be his trip. He can handle soft - Pat Fahy, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-12-03 at Fairyhouse (29.5f): "Street Value deserved this. He took a terrible fall here at Easter when we thought we lost him. For him to come back and do that on a big day is unbelievable. Hopefully he could come back here for an Irish National some day - John Flavin, trainer."
