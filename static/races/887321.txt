🔦 Spotlight: Tailed off/pulled up in tough handicap chases on final two starts last season and he hasn't been at his best over hurdles this term; however, he's not been devoid of spark and chasing seems to be his preferred discipline when he's on song; this 6yo could be on a handy mark and is one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up at Ascot last time but in higher grade; won over C&D last February; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who was pulled up at Ascot (3m, good) three weeks ago and needs to bounce back; however, he's back down in grade today and he's just 1lb higher than when winning over C&D (good) last February on his sole previous course visit; ran well at Cheltenham earlier this season; interesting.

💬 Comment: Needs to build on his fair Musselburgh fourth but that's possible
🔦 Spotlight: Ex Willie Mullins 8yo who has returned from an absence for a 🆕 new yard this season; took step back in right direction when 5l fourth of six at Musselburgh (extended 2m7f, good to soft) last month on his third start back; needs a bigger run today but that's possible; not ruled out.
