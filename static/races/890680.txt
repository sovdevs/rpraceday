🔦 Spotlight: Has form figures of 3115 since switched to AW; held off career-high mark in the Rosebery at Kempton (1m3f) most recently and others are likely to prove better treated.
Horse quote: 2024-12-26 at Wolverhampton (AW) (12f): "We're not going to give hurdles another go at the moment. There are two pretty valuable mile-and-a-half handicaps coming up, the first of which is in about a month's time, so we'll look at those. It was a lovely performance. I'm delighted with Paradias and I don't know why he's not run on the all-weather until recently, but we tested the waters last time and that was strong form, so we thought we'd roll the dice again. He's not been over raced and he's learning to relax better. The step up in trip has helped him too - Alan King, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful performer, albeit has an underwhelming strike-rate; narrowly beat Dark Moon Rising over C&D (off 3lb lower) in most recent AW attempt but this looks a stiffer task.
Horse quote: 2023-07-07 at Sandown (10f): "We were absolutely gutted in the Wolferton. Savvy Victory got knocked over at a crucial time. We had an option of coming here or going for the John Smith's Cup and we chose to come here. We got away with it to be honest as that ground is drying out all the time. We took our time, and came there, and he has quickened on ground he doesn't really like as he would like it heavier. A mile and a quarter is his trip. You haven't seen anything yet. On heavy ground, he will be a proper horse - Sean Woods, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-06-16 at Ascot (10f): "Claymore has always been a proper horse. I think he improved in his trial and last time was just an absolute disaster. The only positive to come out of it was it probably made a man out of him, because his attitude today was brilliant. It was a first-class performance - Adam Kirby, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Current mark gives him a difficult task in this field
🔦 Spotlight: Has some useful form on AW but still has a better strike-rate on turf and current mark gives him a difficult task in this warm field.
Horse quote: 2024-02-24 at Southwell (AW) (12f): "Andaleep was a pleasure to ride. The idea was to sit handy and tough it out, and he was a very game performer - Callum Hutchinson, jockey."
