🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual hurdle winner; ran well from the front when placed on chase debut at Southwell
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who ran well from the front when third on chasing debut at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) in December; tended to jump left there so this switch to a right-handed track is a slight worry but, on the flipside, the forecast faster ground is a big plus.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of form when last seen last summer but may have been refreshed by latest stable switch
🔦 Spotlight: Suffered dip in form after her two good-ground wins for Anthony Honeyball last spring (2m3f/2m) and there was no upturn on last summer's debut for Chris Gordon; makes debut for latest new stable after an eight-month break and with quite a bit to prove but she's on a workable mark; well worth keeping an eye on in the betting.
