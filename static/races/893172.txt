🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 1 winner prior to narrow defeat to The New Lio; can confirm form with Final Demand
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 1 bumper runner-up at this meeting last season and has really kicked on this campaign winning four times over hurdles including Grade 1 Lawlor's Of Naas; even better form when beaten roughly 1l by The New Lion at the Festival with Final Demand in behind and quite possibly better suited to 2m4f than that rival, so he's taken to confirm the form.
Horse quote: 2025-03-12 at Cheltenham (21f): "The Yellow Clay ran a brilliant race and Jack [Kennedy] has given him a peach of a ride and I couldn't be happier with him. He is a good horse. I thought we got a beautiful run throughout the race and I don't think there were any excuses anywhere. There was no hard luck story. They went a good gallop out there and I would say that race will end up being a proper race. We will get him home and see how he is, but he could easily go to either Aintree or Punchestown - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive at the DRF; 3rd behind The Yellow Clay at Cheltenham and may not reverse form
🔦 Spotlight: Couldn't have been much more impressive at the Dublin Racing Festival; didn't jump the last fluently when third behind The New Lion and The Yellow Clay the Festival; not guaranteed to appreciate this slightly shorter trip, particularly on this sort of ground so has his work cut out to reverse form with The Yellow Clay.
Horse quote: 2025-03-12 at Cheltenham (21f): "Final Demand ran a really good race, but he was just not good enough on the day. The New Lion was a very good winner, but we look forward to going chasing with our lad next season. I don't think his jump at the last had any impact. You could see coming to the last that unless we had a day like yesterday he wasn't going to win. I just felt I didn't want to go the trip in the Albert Bartlett at this stage of his career. He will probably end up going three miles next season, but not now. I imagine we will go to Punchestown with him at the end of the season - Willie Mullins, trainer."

💬 Comment: Imrpoving; Naas maiden hurdle success has worked out; major step up in grade though
🔦 Spotlight: Improved with every run, landing an early season Wexford bumper before defying an absence in a Naas maiden hurdle in February; that form has worked out nicely but this is a major step up in grade.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Naas (18.5f): "Lovely Hurling seems to be improving and is one to look forward to. I'm not sure what the plan is, he looks like one who can step up in grade. He has only run on soft ground so I don't know how he will handle better ground, but he has plenty of size and scope. He would get you out of bed in the morning - Colm Murphy, trainer"

💬 Comment: Took form to a new level with Gr 2 success latest, albeit not a strong race for the grade
🔦 Spotlight: Well held in a handicap hurdle at Leopardstown over Christmas but took his form to a new level with a 1l success in a Grade 2 at Fairyhouse; that wasn't the strongest race for the grade and he's going to need a lot more against these.
Horse quote: 2025-04-06 at Fairyhouse (20f): "It's dry ground and Mr Percy didn't mind it. He travelled very well, he missed the last and he's done well to win. He's not a bad horse, he's a decent horse on the Flat. It was a nice bit of placing by the lads - J J Slevin, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-4 under rules; good value for winning mark at Newbury latest but this is a huge step up
🔦 Spotlight: 3-4 under rules and was good value for the winning margin in a novice hurdle at Newbury last time but this is a huge step ⬆️ up in class and he's probably vulnerable.
Horse quote: 2025-03-21 at Newbury (20.5f): "The only horse that's beaten him is Wingmen, who has placed in a couple of Grade 1s and is rated 139. We're very lucky to have him. Queensbury Boy ran very well at Punchestown last year and while it's a big step up in grade, he has class and he's also fresh,. A lot of these talented horses have had tough winters, whereas Queensbury Boy hasn't. He's a novice until the autumn, so the Persian War will definitely be in our mind. I know one of Davids [Maxwell, owner-jockey] dreams is to win the Cheltenham hunter chase. It's a long time off, obviously, but hopefully he'll be that standard one day - Harry Derham, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Impressive in the Grade 2 Dovecote, although reportedly bled and tailed off at Aintree since; looks risky now.
Horse quote: 2025-02-22 at Kempton (16f): "Tripoli Flyer has got a huge engine. Johnny said you can put him where you want in a race, he's got an explosive bit of speed about him. He thought he could have waited a bit longer maybe but he got the job done and we were here to win this. I think he's genuinely better going right-handed and he does jump a bit right, but if it's nice ground I think he's earned his chance to go to the Supreme. He's won plenty now and definitely deserves a go - Fergal O'Brien, trainer.  We'll have a coffee on Monday morning and see where we go. I feel like Aintree owes us one after Tripoli Flyer got beat there last year although I have to be careful what I say as we were beaten by the stable's other runner! - Ismail El Magdoub, owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful on Flat; best hurdle run when 2l behind Irancy latest; form boosted; 2m4f may help
🔦 Spotlight: Useful Flat performer who got his act together over hurdles when third (beaten roughly 2l) in the Grade 2 novice hurdle at Fairyhouse last month, form that received a timely form boost on Tuesday with Grade 1 success for Irancy; quite possibly more to come at this trip (half-brother's best form at 2m4f) and not one to put a line through.
Horse quote: 2024-06-18 at Ascot (14f): "I was so disappointed with My Lyka [19th in the Ascot Stakes] and I was wondering, could Belloccio make up for it? Then I was disappointed when he didn't jump out as fast as I hoped, but William didn't panic. He waited until the race was starting in earnest and produced him with a perfect run. This fellow will probably go to the Ebor. He's entered here on Saturday, but we won't make any decisions about this weekend yet. We'll see how he comes out of this race, and I think the bigger picture may come into it. The long-term aim might be to qualify for the Melbourne Cup. We'll see how things go and I'll have another word with William - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has outrun his odds in graded company on a couple of occasions including this meeting last year when 3l behind Kargese; however, well held in Grade 2 at Fairyhouse last month and this is even tougher.
Horse quote: 2025-03-22 at Navan (16f): "I think Eastern Legend can keep going during the summer and I think on a bit of nicer ground he can improve. He could end up being a Galway Hurdle type of horse if his jumping shaped up and Galway came up on the better side - Keith Donoghue, jockey."
