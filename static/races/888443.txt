🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Goes ⬆️ up in class tonight as he chases a four-timer off a 6lb higher mark; more needed
🔦 Spotlight: Better than ever lately and goes ⬆️ up in class tonight as he chases a four-timer off a 6lb higher mark; won over C&D early last month but does most racing now at 1m2f and wouldn't be best served by a tactical affair against this stronger opposition.

🔦 Spotlight: Useful in his younger days but hasn't won in well over two years and the losing run now stands at 24; is always reliant on luck given his run style, which he hasn't had lately, but he's undeniably well handicapped now having been dropped another 4lb.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual 7.2f winner here who's found his level of late, having left Marco Botti and missed eight months; often blows the start, though, and is another hold-up performer in here who'll be reliant on getting the breaks.

🔦 Spotlight: Last three wins have come early in the year round Southwell and a 6lb rise for his latest victory (by a nose in a small field) looks harsh enough; has only been beyond 7f once, when not looking to see it out, and will find this rather more competitive.
