🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won easily off this mark on last week's handicap/chase debut; clearly well in
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't achieved a lot over hurdles but he could put that right here after a much improved performance on last week's handicap/chase debut at Market Rasen (2m1f, good), where he won comfortably by just over 7l; didn't go unbacked, either; same mark here.

💬 Comment: Unbeaten in handicaps and both were over C&D on good ground last summer
🔦 Spotlight: Unbeaten in handicaps and both were over C&D on good ground last summer; narrowly got the job done last time despite mistakes and a 4lb rise seems fair; has presumably been waiting for conditions to dry up.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual winning hurdler in France; questionable whether the new blinkers made all that much difference over C&D last month (heavy) as he was beaten 8l and only three completed; today's forecast drier ground could also be troublesome.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has hinted at better to come and must be of interest on his handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: May have been placed but for penultimate-flight fall on hurdling debut in October and again showed promise next time; final run was disappointing but that's not done his mark any harm and has to be of interest on handicap debut; all hurdles runs on soft ground.
