💬 Comment: Performed to a good level over hurdles and held a Cheltenham entry until late
🔦 Spotlight: Had an Albert Bartlett entry until the five-day stage; has performed to a good level over hurdles, finishing within 2l of this week's Cheltenham third Diva Luna over 2m4f before pushing a good horse (better known for chasing exploits) close over 2m7f at Uttoxeter; should be hard to beat.

🔦 Spotlight: Irish maiden point winner; beaten five times under rules but ran his best race yet when a 4l third at Uttoxeter last time (2m7f, soft), though was behind Newton Tornado that day; obvious contender.
