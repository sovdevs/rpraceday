🔦 Spotlight: Wasn't beaten far at Doncaster last time, switched to a first-time visor, but his best work has come on Tapeta and it's hard to be sure he's up to winning off this mark on turf (Newcastle win in February came off 5lb lower).

💬 Comment: Has come to hand early the past two seasons; could have done without the dry spell though
🔦 Spotlight: Tough task from out of the weights on his C&D return and has come to hand early the past two seasons, including when winning here first time out in 2023; could have done without the dry spell though.
Horse quote: 2024-05-28 at Brighton (10f): "Eljaytee is a super-genuine horse. He can be a keen and Silvestre [de Sousa], who rode him last time, suggested taking the blinkers off and putting cheekpieces on and he relaxed so well. He stays well so the uphill finish here suits him and, as he likes soft ground, the rain came in time  - John Berry, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
