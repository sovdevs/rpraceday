🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two good 7f runs this year; R Moore on for first time; shaped well in one 6f run in 2024
🔦 Spotlight: Two good runs over 7f this year, albeit unable to reward strong market support at Redcar 11 days ago; Ryan Moore on board for the first time and she ran well in one attempt over 6f last October; should be involved.
Horse quote: 2023-09-15 at Doncaster (7f): "Circe ran in a quality race at Sandown, she was beaten by two horses with experience. I thought she'd step forward and she has. She's a big horse with plenty of scope and she'll make a nice three-year-old - Sean Levey, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive in first season, winning three times; not fully exposed; solid contender
🔦 Spotlight: Eight runs last year, her first season of racing, and she won three and was second in the other five; she will need to improve again to defy her career-high mark but that's quite possible; 2-2 on good to firm so drying ground won't be a problem.

💬 Comment: Refused to settle on her reappearance; hood again left off; manageable mark on 2yo best
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to add to her debut success (6f, good to soft) but she was highly tried for much of her 2yo campaign; refused to settle at Kempton on her return to action last month and weakened in the straight; better than that but the hood is again absent.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four AW wins this winter; 1st turf start for this yard; slow starts an issue off this mark
🔦 Spotlight: Habitual slow starter but it didn't stop her from winning four times at Southwell this winter (all 6f); has won on fast turf in the past and while her turf record isn't entirely convincing, this is her first attempt for Gemma Tutty; not much wiggle room off her current mark though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well three times last month but she'll need plenty more from 6lb out of the weights
🔦 Spotlight: Three fair efforts in 6f-7f handicaps last month, a close second of eight at Yarmouth last week; effectively 6lb higher from out of the weights though and needs a career best to win.

🔦 Spotlight: Two 5f wins as a 2yo before having her limitations exposed in Listed company; should be sharper with her Bath return behind her but her three best efforts have come at the shorter trip.

💬 Comment: All 2yo runs over 7f on AW, winning twice; 6f should be fine; opening mark looks tough
🔦 Spotlight: Sprung a 50-1 surprise at Kempton on her debut last summer (7f) and defied a penalty in fine style at Wolverhampton 25 days later; a double penalty proved a bridge too far at Newcastle in November and she has been absent since; not short of pace and 6f could suit now handicapping on turf but her opening mark will demand another step forward.
