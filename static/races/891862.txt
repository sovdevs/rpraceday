🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Lingfield wins this winter; runner-up in both Chelmsford visits; down in class; solid
🔦 Spotlight: Two Lingfield wins over the winter and he has run well in defeat on his last four starts; needs extra to defy this mark but this is a drop in class and he has finished a close second in both Chelmsford starts; unlikely to be far away.
Horse quote: 2024-12-04 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "The only slight worry was that Monsieur Beaulieu jumped the gates really good and I was just looking for a bit of cover, so I'm just thinking we're dependent on Ross [Coakley, jockey] there but he did everything right - apart from win a bit too far! - Nick Littmoden, trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Couldn't reward market support on last month's return to action; perhaps sharper now
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice on turf last year; market springer on his return to action at Kempton 16 days ago but left the impression his first start since October was needed; still ran well enough to enter the reckoning off 2lb lower.

🎲 Repeat performance: Won before: ❌ No, Placed 2nd or 3rd before: ❌ No
🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good record at the track; off since poor run last August; earlier Haydock win impressive
🔦 Spotlight: Impressive at Haydock last July on his first run for 435 days (and after wind surgery), powering home in a strongly run Class 5 handicap off 7lb lower; absent since a poor run at Haydock one month later; can go well fresh and it's interesting that his in-form Yorkshire-based trainer sends him to Chelmsford, where he has a record of 1212, for his return; check the betting.
Horse quote: 2024-07-19 at Haydock (6f): "Baba Reza does enjoy his racing and it showed today. We love him dearly and he'll come and live with us when he retires, but not yet! He's had a torrid time. They had a bit of a virus at the yard last year and he had to have a wind op. We've had him three years now, but he's been through some really flat times. He's been spending time in a point-to-point yard and he's had a lot of fun, and it shows because he's in a lovely condition - Judy Peck, owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconsistent this winter but on a reduced mark and Rossa Ryan booked; chance on a good day
🔦 Spotlight: Consistency has been an issue during the AW season, running well at Wolverhampton in December and here in February (both 5f) but well beaten on his other four runs; edging down the weights and Rossa Ryan takes over tonight; capable on a good day.
