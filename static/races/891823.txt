🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a poor 5f maiden here last month, albeit with ease; this looks a much stiffer test
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in his first three starts and he didn't need to improve to justify long odds-on favouritism over 5f here last month; won easily on that occasion but this will be a very different test.

💬 Comment: Often highly tried at two but ran well off this mark in one nursery start; yard in form
🔦 Spotlight: Often highly tried after her winning debut at Newbury, unplaced in Group 3s on three occasions; those runs sandwich a good fourth in a nursery at York's Ebor meeting off this mark; stable in fine form and she should be fine on AW; one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well for fourth on handicap debut this month; can do better granted a faster pace
🔦 Spotlight: Steady progress on AW this year, winning at Chelmsford (6f) on second start; not beaten far into fourth on handicap debut at Kempton three weeks ago (Wheels Of Fire sixth) and that effort can be upgraded as he wasn't well positioned; capable of better granted a stronger pace to aim at; one to consider.
Horse quote: 2025-02-13 at Chelmsford (AW) (6f): "Noble Victory did that quite nicely. It wasn't the greatest of races but he seems to have sharpened up from the last run. When I hit the front today he was still a little bit green and I had to give him a couple of reminders just to keep him awake on the job. He could possibly stay seven [furlongs] - Clifford Lee, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner; torrid trip in good race at Newcastle on Good Friday; still 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in three AW novice runs, winning over C&D on the second occasion; one of a few hard-luck stories in the big 3yo sprint at Newcastle on Good Friday, seeing no daylight from 2f out; dropped 1lb and he remains capable of better.
Horse quote: 2024-12-19 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "It was a lovely performance. Don Pacifico put that experience at Wolverhampton to good use and I was very comfortable once I got him relaxed and in a rhythm. He's still inexperienced and had a look around in the straight so hopefully there's more to come- Jack Mitchell, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: 5f Polytrack win as 2yo; unplaced in both his handicaps but was only 4-1 on each occasion
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't need to improve to win a 5f novice event at Lingfield last summer; neither handicap run since points to him being the answer here but it's notable that he was sent off joint favourite at Kempton on this month's return to action.

💬 Comment: 6f turf win at two; promising return to action when close fourth at Pontefract
🔦 Spotlight: Made all in a 6f novice (soft) at Redcar last autumn; ridden more patiently at Pontefract on this month's return to action and that close fourth (just in front of Scatter Penny) was promising; stable also runs Mr Fantastic.

🔦 Spotlight: Won her first two starts as a 2yo (6f, good and good to firm) but unplaced in four handicap starts; stayed on nicely from an unpromising position at Pontefract 19 days ago, her first outing for five months; could well build on that.
