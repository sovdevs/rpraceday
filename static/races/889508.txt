💬 Comment: Has C&D form; shaped as if retaining ability latest; of interest dropped to a classified
🔦 Spotlight: Sole AW win at Wolverhampton in 2022 but he acts well here; it's been a long road back from nearly two years off the track but he shaped a bit better at Wolverhampton recently when not getting the best of runs; interesting and worth a 📊 market check now qualified for this level.

💬 Comment: Chequered career but has C&D form and off the mark over 1m4f at Wolverhampton latest
🔦 Spotlight: Chequered career since close up in C&D novice as a 3yo but there has been the odd bit of encouragement and the drop in grade paid off when rallying to retake the lead inside the final furlong at Wolverhampton (1m4f; cheekpieces refitted) last month; should go well again.
