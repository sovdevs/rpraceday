💬 Comment: Win and second in final two runs last term and he's open to more progress this season
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark (seventh attempt) with a clearcut win at Catterick (1m4f, soft) in October; held in second when odds-on at Redcar (1m6f) the following month but that was another creditable effort and he could find more progress this season; needs close look on his return.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Doncaster before near-miss at Lingfield on Good Friday; respected back on Tapeta
🔦 Spotlight: Turned things around with a win at Doncaster (1m2f, good to soft) in March and he backed that up with a near-miss in valuable apprentice handicap at Lingfield (1m4f) on Good Friday; up another 2lb but his last two runs have been under Mason Paetel and he's respected back on Tapeta.
Horse quote: 2024-04-21 at Musselburgh (12.5f): "Destinado is a very tough horse who's been very consistent since he joined James. This is his trip, he broke well and travelled nicely throughout the race - Aidan Keeley, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Often leads and he's won four times on AW (1m4f-2m); disappointing in small field at Kempton (2m) last month but he's had three close calls this year including at Wolverhampton (1m6f) on his penultimate run; that was off 1lb higher and has claims if he can recapture that form back at this trip.
