🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner; smart maiden hurdle form to his name; only found one too good on return
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner who was third behind Caldwell Potter in a Navan maiden hurdle last season before a career best narrow defeat at the same venue to My Trump Card; creditable efforts in defeat since, including when just in front of the re-opposing Champagne Kid at Punchestown on this season's return; major player with the possibility he'll come on for that first run in 302 days.
