🔦 Spotlight: Won three Class 5s on the bounce and brought up the four-timer in a Class 4 at Southwell (1m6f) with a bit up his sleeve; has another 6lb rise to deal with here but he's on a roll.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Southwell (AW) (14f): "Caballo De Mar has been a slow burner but has been well placed by George (Scott, trainer). He's uncomplicated and stayed on really well. He should stay further again - Daniel Muscutt, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Capable Flat horse (fine on Polytrack) and third in the Fred Winter at Cheltenham latest
🔦 Spotlight: Only Flat win came when long odds-on for a 1m4f Tapeta novice in February but then ran a corker to be third in the Fred Winter at Cheltenham; peak Flat RPR came on Polytrack (Kempton) and, in his current form, he's strongly considered.
Horse quote: 2025-03-11 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "It would have been nice if he'd had a smoother passage, but it's a rough race; four-year-old handicappers who have only run in small fields, but Liam Swagger is a brave horse and I'm really pleased with him. He'll have a Flat campaign now. Chester Cup - James Owen, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Great pedigree, by Sea The Stars and out of Snow Fairy; well beaten in his one handicap last season when the ground was soft; ✂️ gelded ahead of his reappearance (1m4f novice) and finished 10l clear of the rest in pushing an odds-on Andrew Balding horse (now 2-2) close; should stay this far and Ryan Moore is booked.

💬 Comment: Improved second on reappearance; should stay this far and Ryan Moore is booked
🔦 Spotlight: Great pedigree, by Sea The Stars and out of Snow Fairy; well beaten in his one handicap last season when the ground was soft; ✂️ gelded ahead of his reappearance (1m4f novice) and finished 10l clear of the rest in pushing an odds-on Andrew Balding horse (now 2-2) close; should stay this far and Ryan Moore is booked.

💬 Comment: Consistent dual winner in Ireland and left Johnny Murtagh for 52,000gns
🔦 Spotlight: Won 1m4f/1m6f handicaps in Ireland last summer and consistent afterwards in defeat; left Johnny Murtagh for 52,000gns and has joined another good yard; could be interesting with Tom Marquand booked.
Horse quote: 2024-05-20 at Roscommon (12f): "I thought the step up in trip would be a big help to Sixpack. It was a bit of a messy race here last time, they didn't go quick and didn't the gaps when he needed. Everything went to plan today, we went a nice even gallop and I was able to get the gap turning in. I thought he stayed on well to the line and the more racing the better he'll get - Ben Coen, jockey, speaking to Racing TV"

🔦 Spotlight: Two of his three wins have been on turf but has comparable form on Polytrack; should be reasonably treated but signed off last year below his best and he's not getting any younger.
Horse quote: 2022-10-08 at Newmarket (18f): "Vino Victrix is only four and he's a lovely progressive horse. To be able to do that as a four-year-old is impressive and he should have a good future - Hughie Morrison, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has become inconsistent and it was a messy race in which he prevailed at Wolverhampton (1m6f); wouldn't be obvious follow-up material in this deeper contest.
Horse quote: 2024-07-07 at Chelmsford (AW) (13.5f): "If you looked at Cardano today he was looking a million dollars and Ben's horses have been running well all year. I remember working this horse when he was at Ian Williams's and he would be working with the likes of Enemy. He's an older horse now, but he still has massive enthusiasm for the game. The tricky thing today was the draw as Ben said he likes it when horses are coming at him. Once I managed to get to the lead he kept galloping and I simply had a massively willing partner - Ali Rawlinson, jockey."
