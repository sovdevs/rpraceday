🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only fifth in Liverpool Hurdle but could benefit from hood and shorter trip; major claims
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 2-2 for Willie Mullins in Grade 3 at Gowran Park (2m, soft) in February; 15l fifth when upped markedly in trip in Grade 1 Liverpool Hurdle (3m, good) three weeks ago, but this headstrong 5yo could benefit from today's first-time hood and drop back in trip; could play a major role.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Gowran Park (16f): "I love the way Kitzbuhel jumped, he'd have no trouble going over fences. I loved the way he stayed on when it looked like the race was over when he was taken on by Sir Gerhard and he had to find again to take on the challenge of Break My Soul. It's the sign of a real good horse that he was able to pick up a second time. I'm probably looking at Liverpool more so than Cheltenham. With the timing of the race and the two and a half miles for the Liverpool Hurdle, Aintree would be a big possibility. I think he'd love to step up in trip and I'd have no problem going three miles - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten in Stayers' Hurdle but could be a leading player back down in trip/grade
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who has improved this season, with Grade 2 wins at Ascot (2m3f, good) and Cheltenham (2m4f, soft); soundly beaten in the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham (3m, good to soft) last month, but drops back down in trip/grade today and he's a leading player if back to his best.
Horse quote: 2025-01-01 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Lucky Place is an absolute terrier. He doesn't know when he's beat and galloped all the way to the line. I think we'll be stepping up in trip again because he saw out today's trip on soft ground. On spring ground in March, I think three miles [in the Stayers' Hurdle] is where we'll end up - Nico de Boinville, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third in Grade 1 mares' hurdles the last twice; needs a career-best now taking on males
🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 2 mares' hurdle at Ascot (1m7f, good) in January and she's been a creditable third to easy winner Lossiemouth at Cheltenham (2m4f, good to soft) and Aintree (2m4f, good to soft) the last twice; could give another good account now against males but a career-best is required.
Horse quote: 2025-01-18 at Ascot (15.5f): "I thought I was flat out at the home turn but Dan and Harry [Skelton] said Take No Chances would stay really well and to keep after her. I saw Paul Townend's head come upsides me and I thought I might just be in trouble. I suppose he didn't have race fitness on his side and we did - Kielan Woods, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten last time but the return to better ground is a likely plus; in with a chance
🔦 Spotlight: Below best the last twice (particularly last time) and finished held in fourth in this last year; however, today's race may not be as hot and the return to better ground is a likely plus; 1l runner-up to Lucky Place in good-ground Grade 2 at Ascot last November and now 6lb better off; chance.
Horse quote: 2023-11-25 at Ascot (19.5f): "We were hopeful of \Blueking D'Oroux today but we didn't know what he would do, so we haven't made any big plans. I think he has a bit of class, I really do. We were pretty disappointed with the first two runs and we couldn't think of anything else to do but give him a breathing op and it's transformed him. Everything he's done at home has just got better and better - he was hard to train last year but isn't anymore. It's hard to say because I was cheering so much, but it looked like he was just staying and staying, so whether we end up going three miles with him, we'll see. Typically it's a weaker division, so it might make sense. That's a pretty strong performance I'd say - Johnny de la Hey, owner."

💬 Comment: Running creditably this season; could be in the mix if handling the forecast good ground
🔦 Spotlight: 5yo who has been running creditably in defeat this season and was in the mix in the Grade 2 Relkeel Hurdle at Cheltenham (2m4f, soft) in January when falling at the final flight; effective on good to soft (unproven on good); could be in the mix if handling conditions.
Horse quote: 2024-02-17 at Haydock (15.5f): "Salver has done it nicely, it was a case of he's done what he had to do. It's proper heavy ground out there and he goes on it and copes with the conditions. Cheltenham will be ground dependent - I think he'll only be going there if it's soft or worse than soft. If it's a good ground Triumph, I can't see him running there. He's a nice horse - Josh Moore, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Grade 2 at Haydock in February but tailed off in recent Grade 1 at Aintree
🔦 Spotlight: Posted handicap hat-trick at the end of last season and was better than ever when comfortably landing a Grade 2 at Haydock (3m, good to soft) this February; a case can be made on that form but he was tailed off in a Grade 1 at Aintree (3m, good) just three weeks ago and needs to bounce back.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Haydock (24.5f): "Gwennie May Boy won at 80-1 on his debut at Bangor and has been fantastic ever since.There was talk of sticking to last year's plan of Uttoxeter and then Aintree, but we might have to start thinking about Cheltenham - Nick Clarke, owner's son."
