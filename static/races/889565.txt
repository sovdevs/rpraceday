üí¨ Comment: C&D winner; not at best since emphatic Newcastle win in December but had an excuse latest
üî¶ Spotlight: Looked good when winning over C&D last May and again when winning by a wide margin at Newcastle in December; the latter performance saw him clobbered by the handicapper and he has finished well held twice since; wouldn't judge him too harshly on latest run though as those held up were seriously inconvenienced; stable won this race last year.

üî¶ Spotlight: üìà progressive last year, winning twice on AW (once over C&D) and ending that campaign with two solid placed efforts; not at her best at Wolverhampton on her return to action three weeks ago but there were mitigating circumstances (drawn 3 but got involved in a tussle for the lead with stalls 1 and 2 and ended up a bit wide); shouldn't find it so difficult to dominate this time and she remains capable of better.
