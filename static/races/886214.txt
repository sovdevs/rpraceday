🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below par the last twice but has the form to take a lot beating in this winnable race
🔦 Spotlight: Held his own against subsequent winners in his final bumper and then finished second on hurdle debut at Warwick (2m, good); hasn't built on that all, though Newbury was too bad to be true and likely that he was unsuited by soft ground (withdrawn before on account of those conditions) when midfield behind the promising Palladium at Huntingdon; respected.
