💬 Comment: Did a lot wrong when turned over at odds of 1-3 at Wolverhampton in December
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to six winners; did a lot wrong (ran green, hung and carried head awkwardly) when turned over at odds of 1-3 at Wolverhampton in December (8.6f) and the winner has since come up short under a penalty; surely has to find lots on that form to take this but he's in the right hands.

🔦 Spotlight: Similar sort of form in two 1m races on the AW, the debut for Ollie Sangster; the RPRs he produced hint at limitations in a maiden of this nature and perhaps one for handicaps.
