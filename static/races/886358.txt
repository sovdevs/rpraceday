💬 Comment: Last two runs were his best for over a year and he used to be capable of a bit better
🔦 Spotlight: Broke a losing run at Kempton (1m3f, Polytrack) in December and went close from off the pace over C&D five weeks ago; those were his best efforts for over a year and he used to be capable of a bit better; shortlisted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third at Lingfield for 🆕 new yard was his closest finish from five attempts at 1m2f/1m3f
🔦 Spotlight: It was over 1m here in October that he finally made the breakthrough, on penultimate start for Michael Bell; ran creditably both starts since, with third at Lingfield one month ago for 🆕 new yard being his closest finish from five attempts at 1m2f/1m3f; needs a bit extra and now tries a tongue-tie; in-form yard.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Edging down weights and has shown regularly that he's capable of being on the premises
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win was a Polytrack maiden; 0-8 in handicaps but edging down the weights and has shown regularly that he's capable of being on the premises, including with cheekpieces on last two starts; also tongue tied latest; Hollie Doyle's only booked ride on the card.

💬 Comment: Last two runs were his best for over a year and he used to be capable of a bit better
🔦 Spotlight: Broke a losing run at Kempton (1m3f, Polytrack) in December and went close from off the pace over C&D five weeks ago; those were his best efforts for over a year and he used to be capable of a bit better; shortlisted.

💬 Comment: Third at Lingfield for 🆕 new yard was his closest finish from five attempts at 1m2f/1m3f
🔦 Spotlight: It was over 1m here in October that he finally made the breakthrough, on penultimate start for Michael Bell; ran creditably both starts since, with third at Lingfield one month ago for 🆕 new yard being his closest finish from five attempts at 1m2f/1m3f; needs a bit extra and now tries a tongue-tie; in-form yard.

🔦 Spotlight: 13l behind the first two when he took third in a Newcastle novice (1m2f, Tapeta) in October, shortly before leaving the Gosdens for 18,000gns; last of 11 when 200-1 for Southwell maiden soon after that; lacks solid claims but going handicapping should offer a better chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 14-race maiden; finished on the heels of Solanna over C&D on penultimate start
🔦 Spotlight: 14-race maiden; finished on the heels of Solanna over C&D on penultimate start and ran respectably in first-time blinkers at Kempton (1m) latest; return to 1m2f should suit but he's not the percentage call.
