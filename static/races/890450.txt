🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has an excellent course record but suited by soft ground and rarely tackles good going now
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up at Ayr last month but she has a very solid record on this track, winning over 3m2f and 2m5f; however, there is a big surface query as although a good-ground winner over hurdles she hardly ever tackles the surface now and was pulled up on it in November.
