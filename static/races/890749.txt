🔦 Spotlight: 5-13 in point-to-points; won a hunters chase at this venue over 2m7f (good) last May; got to within 2l of Carnfunnock at Kirkistown last month and he ran well in the St James's Place at Cheltenham on Friday; this trip may be a shade sharp but he has leading form claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner in February 2023, best form has come on testing ground, others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: 1-5 in point-to-points, that win coming in February 2023; went close in a 2m5f hunters chase at Clonmel in January 2024 on heavy; best form has come on testing ground so good ground is a concern; others preferred.
