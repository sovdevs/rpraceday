🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won his last four, the last three over 1m6f here; well worth this first crack at 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Ended last season with two wins and started this campaign with two more; last three of those were over 1m6f at this track and with something up his sleeve again last time, ahead of Gibside, for which he's gone up another 6lb but he's well worth this first crack at 2m; withdrawn (upset in the stalls) nine days ago; if all's well after that he should be a major player.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Southwell (AW) (14f): "Caballo De Mar has been a slow burner but has been well placed by George (Scott, trainer). He's uncomplicated and stayed on really well. He should stay further again - Daniel Muscutt, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner and pipped in the Cesarewitch; his stable is going great guns
🔦 Spotlight: Made hay in 2023 and carried on the good work with better form in 2024, beaten a nose in the Cesarewitch at Newmarket (2m2f, soft) on final start; given another 4lb rise but he won over C&D last August, went close first time out last season and his stable is going great guns; highly respected.
Horse quote: 2024-10-12 at Newmarket (18f): "Manxman ran a great race and I thought we'd won when he went past the line. He's a very progressive horse and he will be nice prospect for staying races next year - Simon Crisford, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner in March and beaten a head at Newbury (2m, good) 16 days ago
🔦 Spotlight: Has done well on the Flat and over hurdles for his current yard, most recently with a C&D win in March and when beaten a head at Newbury (2m, good) 16 days ago; up another 2lb but has to be on the shortlist.
Horse quote: 2024-09-19 at Yarmouth (14f): "I bought Charging Thunder on spec and sold him about an hour before the race, so it's all gone well. He was a good horse back in his day and has slipped into the lowest grade he's run in for a while. We've schooled him and he's taken to that quite well. He was going to go hurdling next, but after today we might change our mind, although he'll see a hurdle at some point - trainer James Owen speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Reliable sort who signed off for 2024 with a taking win at York (second go at 2m) in October; resumed with excellent never-nearer second to Caballo De Mar here (1m6f) and could improve again now that he's back over 2m.

💬 Comment: Third on the valuable card at Newcastle (2m, Tapeta) nine days ago was career-best form
🔦 Spotlight: All five of his wins have been on Tapeta at up to 1m6f, the latest in February; third on the valuable card at Newcastle (2m) nine days ago was career-best form and he has to be in serious calculations.
Horse quote: 2025-02-11 at Wolverhampton (AW) (14f): "I think two miles last time just stretched Heathen. He seems to be a horse who runs well fresh. He's quite delicate to handle and Dave [O'Meara, trainer] does a great job with horses like him. It all went smoothly, I was a bit worried about lack of pace but, even when the raced turned into a sprint, he could still travel into it well - Jason Watson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Dual AW winner late in 2023 and he had a good campaign on turf in 2024
🔦 Spotlight: Dual AW winner late in 2023; won at Salisbury (1m6f, soft) on second start last term and ran well in 2m/2m4f fast-ground handicaps at top meetings last summer, before two creditable shows back on soft in October; readiness first time out might be an issue and he needs a 📊 market check.
Horse quote: 2024-05-16 at Salisbury (14f): "Hughie [Morrison, trainer] was a bit worried about the ground but Kyle Of Lochalsh managed to get the job done nicely. Considering he handles this ground it could open up some options for him. I think he could climb through the ranks - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Slow starts have become a habit and he can look reluctant to race; he still won twice (1m4f in June and 1m6f in October) last season and took a few minor honours on the way, including over C&D (behind Manxman) on his only attempt at 2m; mood and fitness are questions but he's not totally dismissed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made the frame in two novice hurdles this winter for 🆕 new yard after more than a year out
🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame in two novice hurdles this winter for 🆕 new yard after more than a year out; not seen on Flat since 2023 but she's on her last winning mark (2m2f here in December 2022) and is also well treated on 2023 form.
Horse quote: 2023-07-28 at Ascot (16f): "Blazeon Five had a little bronc. I thought she was quite tired pulling up, but perhaps she could have gone around again. She had a little buck and dropped the shoulder on me, it's something you expect on a Monday morning but not here. It was a weird race pace-wise, essentially we had a target to run at entering the straight and he dropped away. Temporize took me to a point where I felt like I was going okay, but when he dropped away I was left in front with a bit to run and I had to commit. I think she was just waiting for him - Jack Mitchell, jockey."

💬 Comment: Failed to shine last year for Emmet Mullins; first run since a 8,500gns sale in September
🔦 Spotlight: Went close on sole AW start, on Polytrack in 2021; big chance on best 2023 efforts for Roger Varian but he did not shine last year (hurdles/Flat) for Emmet Mullins; off since August and this is his first run since a 8,500gns sale in September; visor replaces cheekpieces.
