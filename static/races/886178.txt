🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 in h'caps, with something to spare each time; up 8lb but could still be well treated
🔦 Spotlight: Won readily on handicap debut at Taunton (2m3f, good to soft) and again had something to spare there (2m3f, soft) nine days later, when unpenalised; hit with 8lb rise but this 🔍 unexposed 6yo could still be well treated.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise on both hurdle starts and he could have potential off his opening mark
🔦 Spotlight: Point runner-up who capitalised on the clear leader's fall to win on hurdle debut at Newbury (2m, soft) in December, before fair third at Hereford (2m5f, soft) last month; he could do with settling better than last time but it looked a good race and he could have potential off his opening mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not obviously well treated off opening mark but has shown promise and could improve
🔦 Spotlight: British maiden point winner who was runner-up at Lingfield (2m3f, soft) in December on his second hurdle start and also showed fair form when third there (2m7f, soft) recently; he's not obviously well treated off his opening mark but is a possible 🚀 improver now handicapping; monitor the betting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A win and a fair third from her two hurdle starts; in good hands to progress
🔦 Spotlight: Soft-ground 3m point runner-up who stayed on well to win on her hurdle debut at Uttoxeter (2m, good) in November, before a fair third at Ludlow (2m5f, good to soft) in December; improvement is needed off her opening mark but this 🔍 unexposed mare is in good hands to progress.
