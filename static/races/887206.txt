🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Challenging when falling two out on handicap debut at Lingfield and has the same mark here
🔦 Spotlight: Disputing the lead when falling two out on handicap debut at Lingfield (2m3f, soft) in November and when pulled up there last time (2m4f, heavy) it was his chase debut and he made mistakes; this 🔍 unexposed 6yo has the same mark as two starts ago and could play a leading role.
