🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rather exposed; chance of winning depends on the effects of a gelding operation
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a double last July in first two handicap attempts; 0-5 since but most of that form is respectable; chance of winning depends on the effects of a physical tweak (✂️ gelded since last run).
Horse quote: 2024-07-12 at Ascot (6f): "I did think the stiffer six furlongs today would suit Art Market but I was a little bit unsure how the ground would have dried out if it became holding ground. He actually handled it fine, it's pretty nice ground out there, but I needed every yard of the six furlongs to get him going. He's the type that the more you ask, the more he finds. He still is learning about the game and he's going the right way - Adam Farragher, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-05-17 at Newmarket (6f): "I bought Camera Shy for 50,000 guineas at the Doncaster breeze-ups, I would have paid more but he didn't breeze that well to be honest. The consignor Paddy Vaughan put him to me and he was right - Nick Bell, trainer's son."
