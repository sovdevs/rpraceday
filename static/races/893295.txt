🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rather exposed; chance of winning depends on the effects of a gelding operation
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a double last July in first two handicap attempts; 0-5 since but most of that form is respectable; chance of winning depends on the effects of a physical tweak (✂️ gelded since last run).
Horse quote: 2024-07-12 at Ascot (6f): "I did think the stiffer six furlongs today would suit Art Market but I was a little bit unsure how the ground would have dried out if it became holding ground. He actually handled it fine, it's pretty nice ground out there, but I needed every yard of the six furlongs to get him going. He's the type that the more you ask, the more he finds. He still is learning about the game and he's going the right way - Adam Farragher, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-09-29 at Curragh (7f): "Montpellier Green has taken time to figure out but the juice in the ground suited him today and I thought he won nicely. He showed a nice attitude today - Joseph O'Brien, trainer."
