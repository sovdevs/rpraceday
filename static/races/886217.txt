🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten in novice hurdles but this former pointer now goes up in trip on h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten at triple-figure odds in three 2m1f novice hurdles towards the end of last year but this lightly raced 6yo now goes handicapping off a basement mark and he made the frame in a 3m point last May, so could be suited by the step up in trip; one to watch in the betting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point/bumper winner who is open to improvement now up in trip on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on his three hurdle starts and not obviously well treated off her opening mark; however, she's won a 3m point and a course bumper, and the wind operation, first-time headgear and step up in trip are all possible sources of improvement on her handicap debut.
