üí¨ Comment: Won easily at Leopardstown, up 11lb and longer trip now, handles most ground, claims again
üî¶ Spotlight: 2-13 over hurdles; won in emphatic style at Leopardstown (2m4f, yielding) earlier this month in first time blinkers (retained) and hiked up 11lb; step up in trip here should pose no problems and she acts on most ground; dangerous to discount in current form.
