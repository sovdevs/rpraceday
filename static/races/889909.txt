🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three-time Flat scorer, placed in nine of her ten hurdle starts, risky but may deliver now
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time Flat winner, including for this stable over 1m6f at Carlisle last summer; frustrating over hurdles, placed in nine of her ten starts; has achieved a rating of 117 and probably worth one more chance having finished a long way clear of the remainder when beaten by a Willie Mullins-trained mare at Punchestown 12 days ago.
