💬 Comment: Rated 80, good third on latest, blinkers replace cheekpieces, yard in form, big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Top rated with a mark of 80; best effort yet came on latest when a 1l third of 11 at the Curragh in a 6f maiden (soft) in first-time cheekpieces which are now replaced by blinkers; leading claims on the figures and her yard is in good form; big chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Promise when staying on for fourth on debut at Naas (6f, yielding) behind Bodhi Bear in October; narrowly denied stepped up to 7f at Dundalk the following month and off since; rated 75 so has a bit to find dropped back in trip but the stiff uphill finish here should suit; 🔥 big player if she's fit after her break.

🔦 Spotlight: Rated 74; sound efforts in defeat in a trio of maidens last year at 6f on good ground and on the AW; blinkers worn for underwhelming handicap debut at Cork (6f) in October are discarded; returns with her yard in form; the market should reveal expectations.

🔦 Spotlight: Mehmas filly had issues at the start on debut at Dundalk (5f) in February when a 5-1 shot but she showed a bit of promise and finished a 3.25l fourth; should improve for that and 6f may suit on breeding but her yard has yet to have a winner this season.

💬 Comment: Placed in maidens at 5f-6f for former yard, ground versatile, 🆕 new yard, check market
🔦 Spotlight: 71 rated maiden but ran well in defeat on multiple occasions for former yard; has placed in 5f-6f maidens at the Curragh, Tipperary and Cork on heavy and good; sold for 6,000Euros in November; has to give weight away and lacks a run but worth a 📊 market check on stable debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Well-bred daughter of Bated Breath offered something to work with when an 8l fourth of 9 on debut at Dundalk (7f) in December, weakening late on; this shorter trip should suit better on the evidence of that run and her yard is 11-58 here in the last five seasons; could go well.
