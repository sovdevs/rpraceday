🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not at very best this winter but still running well enough to be of interest at this level
🔦 Spotlight: Operating at a level below her best this winter but she's still been competitive, including a good third in a Class 4 here (6f) last month; not at best on Friday but back against her own sex and returning to 7f won't be a problem.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Overcame adversity to win at Southwell 11 days ago; up 5lb but not out of it
🔦 Spotlight: Gained her first AW win at the 11th attempt when leading late at Southwell 11 days ago; that wasn't much of a race and she's been hit with a 5lb rise but she did overcome some adversity to score and she still has handicapping scope on her old form; respected.
