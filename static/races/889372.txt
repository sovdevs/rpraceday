🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy odds-on winner last time (3m2f); perhaps more a staying prospect but he's promising
🔦 Spotlight: Won British maiden point by 7l on debut in April 2023; absent until second this season in maiden hurdles here (near 2m4f) and at Ascot (extended 2m5f) before easily going one better when 8-13 at Hereford (3m2f); last two of those (his best form) were on good to soft, unraced on good; perhaps more of a staying prospect but he's promising.

💬 Comment: Off the mark in 2m handicap at Newbury latest; penultimate start makes this trip a worry
🔦 Spotlight: Failed to get home over 2m4f at Sandown on penultimate start, having raced freely on his only go in cheekpieces; 📈 progressive over shorter than that and got off the mark in 2m handicap at Newbury (soft) on latest outing but, despite his pedigree, this trip is a worry.

🔦 Spotlight: 40-1 win at Ffos Las (soft) and creditable third at Fakenham (good) next time, both at 2m4f; pulled up when 14-1 in the EBF Final at Sandown (good to soft) three weeks ago but this is a vastly less competitive affair and he could bounce back; in the shake-up if he does.

💬 Comment: Three starts for Nicky Henderson, second to an impressive winner in a 3m maiden at Ludlow
🔦 Spotlight: Had three starts for Nicky Henderson, ending last month with second to an impressive winner in maiden hurdle at Ludlow (3m, good to soft) where he was hampered at the third last but that did not cost him the win; has changed hands and should still have some potential but the penalised winners in this have shown a fair bit more.
