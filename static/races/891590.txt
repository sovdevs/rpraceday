🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Beverley (5f, good to firm) last August by short head, the best form in this field
🔦 Spotlight: 11-1, won ten-runner novice at Beverley (5f, good to firm) last August by a short head, racing freely and always prominent despite a slow start; not seen since but the runner-up is pretty useful and that's the best form in this line-up.
Horse quote: 2024-08-15 at Beverley (5f): "Kevin [Ryan, trainer] and Sheikh Mohammed Obaidh [owner] have always held Lothlorien in high regard at home and have just taken their time with her. It's paid off and she's a nice filly. She has loads of size about her and I'd say she's quite smart - Tom Eaves, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Third of nine at Southwell (6f, AW) three weeks ago puts her in serious calculations
🔦 Spotlight: Second favourite for a 6f fillies' novice at Windsor last October but never featured; that was on heavy ground and she was seen to vastly better effect when third of nine in novice at Southwell (6f, AW) three weeks ago; that puts her into serious calculations.
