🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins last November and he was a good second here in February; quiet since though and others look stronger.
Horse quote: 2024-11-21 at Wolverhampton (AW) (7f): "Harbour Vision knows his way round here better than all of us! He jumped well enough but there was plenty of pace and he really settled for me. The gap opened up on the inside and he was away - Taryn Langley, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Had a BHA rating in the high 80s in his pomp for Richard Fahey; justified strong favouritism in determined style at Leicester on his stable debut a fortnight ago (7f, good to firm); remains well treated up 3lb and a tongue-tie now goes on.
