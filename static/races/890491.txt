🔦 Spotlight: 19-race maiden; hasn't had many chances over fences (0-4) and was placed at Market Rasen (2m1f) and Worcester (2m) last August/September; returns from six-month break and is probably best watched with others more appealing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 19-race maiden; placed at Market Rasen & Worcester last summer; back from break.
🔦 Spotlight: 19-race maiden; hasn't had many chances over fences (0-4) and was placed at Market Rasen (2m1f) and Worcester (2m) last August/September; returns from six-month break and is probably best watched with others more appealing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course hurdles winner (unlucky not to double up); switches to fences on return from break.
🔦 Spotlight: Won over hurdles here (2m1f conditionals') in October and would have doubled up but for falling at the last the following week; a rise in the weights has limited opportunities, but he's been given plenty of time since a below par Uttoxeter run; potential on pedigree to make a chaser (debut).

Horse quote: 2022-09-17 at Navan (16f): "We fancied Nonbinding in Downpatrick and he just got wiped out of it. Davy (Russell) was happy with him there today. He probably wants further and he's a big chaser. He jumped well today - Gordon Elliott, trainer."
