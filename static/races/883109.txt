🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made it 4-4 over hurdles with Grade 1 win at Naas; clearly 📈 progressive; possible contender
🔦 Spotlight: Sixth in last season's Champion Bumper then runner-up in Grade 1 at Punchestown; won two Graded novice hurdles at Navan (2m4f, yielding/soft) at end of last year and made it 4-4 in this sphere with 8l win in Grade 1 at Naas (2m4f, soft) in January; clearly 📈 progressive for a top Irish trainer in Gordon Elliott, who won this in 2018 and 2020, and a possible contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Grade 1 novice at Aintree in December; may be better than he showed here last time
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 4-4 under rules with impressive Grade 2 win over C&D (good) in November and followed up in Grade 1 Formby Novices' Hurdle at Aintree (2m1f, soft); no match for Sixmilebridge when odds-on for Grade 2 here (2m4f, soft) in January but that run was reportedly "a bit of an afterthought" and might not be the limit of his ability; tongue-tie goes on; each-way chance.
