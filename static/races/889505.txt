🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced since winning sole start at two; back from another absence; plenty to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Won a four-runner Chelmsford novice (1m2f, Polytrack) on his only outing as a 2yo, but out of the frame in all four starts after reappearing last April; still 🔍 unexposed but he returns from another 224 days off with plenty to prove; hood returns.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ended a 13-race losing run at Wolverhampton in December, but well held there last time
🔦 Spotlight: Took advantage of a falling mark when ending a 13-race losing run at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) in December, but well held over the same C&D the following month; 79-day absence since then not a major issue, but not quite sure what to expect.
