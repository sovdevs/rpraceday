🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Comes here in good form and still feasibly treated; not at his best in two course runs
🔦 Spotlight: Ran out the easy winner of a 6f classified event at Southwell last month and he has run well in defeat in two runs since, latterly second of nine (beaten a neck) at Wolverhampton; up 2lb but still has handicapping scope; not at best in two previous visits to Newcastle.
