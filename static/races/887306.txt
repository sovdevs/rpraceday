🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Travelled well when second at Wetherby and this shorter trip could be just what he needs
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who did well to finish a close fourth on his stable and chase debut at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft) in January, having been badly hampered two out on that first run since March 2023, and he travelled well when a clear runner-up at Wetherby (extended 2m3f, soft) next time; the drop back in distance could be just what this lightly raced 8yo needs.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up in sole chase but this lightly raced point/novice h'dle winner retains potential
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up on his chase debut at Carlisle (2m, soft) in December after six months off but he may have needed that run; this lightly raced soft-ground point winner landed a novice hurdle at Hexham (2m, good) last June and retains potential for his good yard; not written off.
