🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran green in sole 2yo run but he's 3-3 this year and is open to more progress; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Too green to do himself justice in one turf run as a 2yo but he's found stacks of improvement with three wins on AW this year; up another 4lb after his handicap debut win at Kempton (1m3f) but he was strong at the finish and is open to progress on this step up to 1m4f; leading contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won here in November and she looks interesting now upped to 1m4f on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Siblings include her connections' Ascot Gold Cup winner Big Orange; showed promise in her first two runs in the autumn before a last-gasp win over 8.6f here in November; returns after a break but she looks on a fair opening mark and should have more to offer on this step up to 1m4f; interesting contender on handicap debut.
