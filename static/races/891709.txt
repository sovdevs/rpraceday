🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner who ran respectably in 2m3f Newbury handicap last month; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Good-ground bumper winner who made it second-time lucky over hurdles when justifying favouritism here (2m, good to soft) in November; beaten around 9l over C&D (runner-up) and at Newbury (2m3f handicap) since but those were solid enough efforts and he still has potential for Paul Nicholls; respected with cheekpieces removed back in a novice.
Horse quote: 2023-11-29 at Hereford (16f): "He's been working away nicely with the horse that won at Ascot on Saturday (Regent's Stroll). We'll have one run in the spring and that'll do for Jackpot Des Bordes this season - something like the Listed bumper at Newbury on Denman Chase day (February 10). He's a nice horse and one for the future - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

💬 Comment: Tailed off in a bumper and a 2m maiden hurdle at Wincanton this year
🔦 Spotlight: Single-figure prices in two runs this year but he was beaten 39l in a Wincanton bumper (1m7f, good to soft) and was further adrift on hurdling debut there (2m, good) last month; plenty to prove and needs a transformation upped in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had tough task in Grade 2 latest and is a 🔥 big player back in much calmer waters on return
🔦 Spotlight: Showed plenty of promise on hurdling debut when runner-up in big field at Listowel (2m, good to yielding) last June; made all when landing the odds at Worcester (2m, good) in September and he had a tough task in Grade 2 at Chepstow (2m3f, soft) in final run in the autumn; had wind surgery since and he's a 🔥 big player back in much calmer waters on his return.
