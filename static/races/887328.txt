🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chased home much improved rival at Newcastle in December; remains on good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Out of form in early part of this season but returned from break with good effort at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft), travelling well before succumbing to a much-improved rival; remains on a good mark; major player.
