🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Talented but could find trouble in a match; close 3rd here on Sunday; e-w claims again
🔦 Spotlight: Notoriously tricky to win with but there's no doubting his ability and he won the big sprint on this card back in 2022; close third over C&D on Sunday having found plenty of trouble; shouldn't be far away.
Horse quote: 2024-09-15 at Musselburgh (5f): "It worked out well. I haven't a clue why Zarzyni won there, we've tried everything with him. He's very smart, but I don't think the horse knows he's won. If he had time to think he'd have got beaten. He's a handy type to have in the yard as he's a very good work horse. When we have sprinters we have to work, he's the boy. We're thankful he's won and Musselburgh's been a lucky place for us -  oint-trainer David Barron, speaking on Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Improved his excellent C&D record when finishing fast here on Sunday; should go well again
🔦 Spotlight: Well into the veteran stage but he retains lots of enthusiasm and he enhanced his fine C&D record when beating six of today's rivals to win last Sunday; picked up impressively once seeing daylight and can confirm his superiority despite the revised weights.
Horse quote: 2025-04-13 at Musselburgh (5f): "We had this planned a long way out and we had the best jockey in the north of Britain on - he doesn't panic. We were going to retire Only Spoofing last year but he's not one for that just yet. He's a tough nut and doesn't think he's 11 - Kevin Coleman, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest C&D 4th can be upgraded; will need luck in running but handicapped to go well
🔦 Spotlight: Another in the field who needs things to fall just right but he made a pleasing return to turf over C&D on Sunday, meeting a bit of traffic when initially launching his challenge and also caught towards the middle of the track; capable off this mark if the gaps appear.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three wins in 2024, well suited by testing ground; back from six months off; others safer
🔦 Spotlight: Three 5f wins last year, one on Tapeta and the other two on testing ground at Hamilton; could prove vulnerable on a sounder surface back from six months off.
Horse quote: 2024-03-05 at Southwell (AW) (5f): "That was very straightforward. Moonstone Boy has been knocking on the door and deserved to win. Iain [Jardine, trainer] and Andrew [Mullen, regular jockey] said to me that he'd come on leaps and bounds from his first run here. He's got a lot of speed - Paul Mulrennan, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Prominent racer who won twice on turf last September; in and out on AW this winter but he's slipped down the weights and the return of cheekpieces can help back on turf; should go well in a race in which the majority like to come from off the pace.
