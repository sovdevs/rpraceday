🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Makes handicap debut with yard in a fine run of form and the trip should be more than okay
🔦 Spotlight: Not disgraced in two Graded races after winning his maiden (2m3f, soft) and made mistakes when no match for a talented winner back in a novice at Kempton (2m5f, good); makes handicap debut with his yard in a fine run of form and the trip should be more than okay; tongue-tie added.
Horse quote: 2024-10-29 at Chepstow (19.5f): "We've always liked Quebecois and we thought he'd win, but we didn't quite know what to expect past that. He jumps nicely and is a half-brother to Brindisi Breeze, so he's from a good family and he's got the right attitude. The Challow would have to be in our sights. When Stage Star won this we sent him to Newbury before the Challow, so I suspect we'll up Quebecois in grade and go somewhere similar in a month's time. He'll improve a fair bit yet with more experience. We'd like to think he's in that sort of Stage Star, Hermes Allen bracket - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Ran Supreme runner-up William Munny close in a bumper but was well behind that same rival in a Listed race on his penultimate start, since when he has again performed below his best at Navan (2m6f); represents Team Mullins but hasn't built on an encouraging start over hurdles and he's not bred for this new trip.
Horse quote: 2024-12-03 at Clonmel (19.5f): "C'Est Ta Chance had a good first run last year and we think he is better than his latest two runs, so hopefully he will make into a graded horse - Patrick Mullins, rider"
