🔦 Spotlight: Won comfortably in first-time tongue-tie at Wetherby (2m3f, good to soft) on Boxing Day and ran well in defeat on both subsequent outings (once over C&D); not sure to be favoured by today's faster ground but still features prominently in calculations.

💬 Comment: Course winner over hurdles in December but dropped out rather tamely on chasing debut
🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles in 16-runner handicap here (2m4f, good) in December and has been placed at Ayr (2m4f, soft) since, but dropped out of contention very tamely when favourite for chasing debut over C&D (good) four weeks ago; now has a point to prove.
