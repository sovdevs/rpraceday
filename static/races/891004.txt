🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promise on heavy on debut at Gowran, not as good at the Curragh, now hooded, watch
🔦 Spotlight: Displayed promise on heavy on debut at Gowran over 8.5f; not as good at the Curragh second time out when upped to 1m; now hooded and probably best watched on this occasion.
