🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flat winner at 1m2f; quick jumper who has already won twice over hurdles; good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Flat winner at 1m2f who made successful hurdle debut at Sedgefield (2m1f, good); did the dirty at Catterick in December when ducking out at the second last but he was never headed at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) last month, impressing with his sharp jumping; ran well on the Flat for Freddie Keighley who takes over today; good chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hurdle wins at 2m on heavy/soft; close 2nd latest; surface switch is a query
🔦 Spotlight: Hurdle wins at 2m on heavy and soft, most recently at Lingfield in December, and he ran his best race since when pushing a subsequent winner close at Ludlow recently; entitled to be involved but, although he won a Flat claimer on good ground, the surface switch raises a query.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Several breaks in career; off since June and sold for £3,000 since; down in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Career littered with absences and he's back from another one today, having left Dan Skelton for £3,000 since his latest run last June; failed to win for that yard but he kept better company than this and good ground will suit; not forlorn for 🆕 new yard.
