💬 Comment: Suddenly returned to form with comfortable win from the front at Exeter a week ago
🔦 Spotlight: Looked out of sorts during autumn/winter but suddenly back to form at Exeter (2m3f, good) a week ago, making all to win comfortably by 8l; yet fully to convince stamina-wise over this sort of trip but still needs to be taken very seriously under 7lb penalty.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back in good nick when second here in first-time blinkers last month; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably exploited excellent opportunity in uncompetitive, three-runner novice chase at Exeter (2m3f, good) in November and rebounded from a very laboured performance when second in first-time blinkers here (2m5f, soft) last month; still 🔍 unexposed at around 3m and could have more to offer over fences if the headgear continues to keep him motivated.
