🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved on going hurdling and won back on the flat at Limerick on Friday; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Better since going hurdling over the winter, winning at Limerick and good second in Punchestown handicap; let down by jumping when very disappointing favourite in Downpatrick handicap but bounced back to get up late in 1m4f Limerick handicap yesterday, winning a shade snugly; major player if turning out again under 7lb penalty.
Horse quote: 2024-12-26 at Limerick (16f): "Out For A Stroll had the experience and I made use of it. She missed one or two but she did everything well for me. The two jumps at the last two really helped me - Peter Smithers, rider."

💬 Comment: Strong-finishing Gowran second on Wednesday; obvious claims with Keane taking over
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win in either code came on the AW over 2m in January but career-best when strong-finishing close second in Gowran handicap over this trip on Wednesday, having allowed winner first run; Keane now takes over and obvious claims off same mark.
Horse quote: 2025-01-17 at Dundalk (AW) (16f): "Elle Dorado Rock was suited when they started to race halfway down the back and he was able to pick them off. He really needs a couple of furlongs extra - Robbie Colgan, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-05-16 at Limerick (11.5f): "Forlio has done some amount of work but I did think he would need the run. Colin said he didn't really love the ground as it was sticky for him so normal soft would be better for him - Paul Flynn, trainer."

Horse quote: 2020-12-12 at Cheltenham (24f): "The trip was a bit of an unknown. John (McConnell) was pretty sure Make Good wanted at least two and a half miles but because of the ground we didn't actually go too quick, so it wasn't a slog. He has had 35 runs before today and a tough, strong horse was always going to be suited by these conditions - Richard Johnson, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Winner on soft at Roscommon in 2023 and scored early last year on AW (both 1m4f); absent since October so market likely best guide on return.
Horse quote: 2023-03-05 at Wexford (16f): "Secret Rock is still putting all the pieces of the puzzle together but hopefully there will be improvement off that. I think that will sharpen him up a lot - Peter Carberry, jockey, speaking to RacingTV."

Horse quote: 2024-11-07 at Clonmel (24f): "I suppose Plains Indian was the class horse in the race being a Listed winner and I know he has been disappointing but the ground was too soft for him all year - Willie Slattery, stable representative."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Better AW performer, not an obvious one for turf return
🔦 Spotlight: Sole flat win came on AW, fair form over the winter on that surface; not an obvious one for turf return.
Horse quote: 2023-08-17 at Tramore (16f): "Rockview Consort  jumped well. John (McConnell) does a good job schooling his horses at home, he doesn't like to miss with these nice ones first-time out. I kept it simple, it was a nice even gallop and you can do that around here on good ground. It was a pretty good performance and she's one we'll look forward to - Ben Harvey, jockey, talking to Racing TV"

🔦 Spotlight: Dundalk winner last October, having won over this trip at Sligo (soft) previous year; recent Gowran run leaves him with a fair bit to find.
Horse quote: 2023-08-09 at Sligo (13f): "We schooled Glyde Ranger over hurdles a couple of months back and that's always been in our mind. He's not overly big but is a horse who is starting to find his bit of confidence. We might go for another race on the Flat first but he'll go hurdling before the better ones come out - Tom McCourt, trainer, talking to Racing TV"
