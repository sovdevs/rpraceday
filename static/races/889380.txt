🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very useful at best; ran well back from absence; not so good since; big chance at weights
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful at best but pulled up in all three starts in 2022 then went missing for nearly two years; showed there was plenty left in him when runner-up at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) in October but he didn't convince at Lingfield in December; ought to be a huge factor here.
