🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed at Wolverhampton the last twice (latest form strong); more to come; tough draw
🔦 Spotlight: Confirmed his debut promise by easily landing the odds in a 6f Wolverhampton novice last September; followed up back at Wolverhampton in November, giving 7lb and a comfortable beating to a pair who won their next start; fine sprinting prospect but connections wouldn't have chosen stall 12.
