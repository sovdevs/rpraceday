🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Will be suited by this extra 1f if able to reproduce her latest effort off the same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Much her best effort last year came at Catterick and she surged back to form there a fortnight ago; will be suited by today's extra furlong if able to reproduce the effort off the same mark.
Horse quote: 2024-08-19 at Catterick (6f): "I wasn't sure if we got up. I thought we had a great draw in stall one but it played against us. We were a few rows back further than I'd have liked and had to wait for a gap, but The Feminine Urge showed a good attitude when she got out - Callum Rodriguez, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."
