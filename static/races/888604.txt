🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**

🔦 Spotlight: 0-20; runner-up on Polytrack three times in a row (twice at this track) over 7f last August/September, before a disappointing run in October; off since, has changed hands and left Dominic Ffrench Davis; capable of a bold show at this trip as well if he's on song after the layoff, for which a recent Flat winner for his 🆕 new yard gives hope.
