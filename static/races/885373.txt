💬 Comment: Justified favouritism over C&D and at Windsor (3m, soft); up another 5lb but lots to like
🔦 Spotlight: Won three successive handicap hurdles last winter and now bids for three in a row over fences after justifying favouritism over C&D and at Windsor (3m, soft); raised another 5lb but lots to like, including that he has nothing to prove regarding stamina.

💬 Comment: Has made a satisfactory switch to chasing and this new trip might be within reach
🔦 Spotlight: Won well in two novice hurdles in the mud at Wincanton last winter, latterly over an extended 2m5f; has looked in similar form switched to chasing this season, which he needs to improve on but he'd taken the measure of Saint Davy and Hillcrest when they came a cropper at Ffos Las last time, when he had a tongue-tie fitted, and this new trip might be within reach.

🔦 Spotlight: Fine season last term as a novice hurdler included front-running second in the EBF Final at Sandown (2m4f, soft); crumpled on landing mid-race on chase debut but went close at Exeter (2m3f, soft) two months later and has plenty more to offer in this sphere; upped in trip and one to note.

🔦 Spotlight: Point, bumper and hurdles winner who ran well in a Grade 2 novice at Sandown (3m, soft) in December on chase debut; beaten and tiring, however, when he took a heavy fall three out in Grade 2 at Ffos Las (extended 2m3f, soft) four weeks ago; that's a concern but he is better over this sort of trip and looked promising going into that race.

💬 Comment: Long absence before this term, which has looked a major struggle over fences; headgear now
🔦 Spotlight: A star novice hurdler of the 2021-22 season, until final start; absent for 981 days afterwards and it's looked a major struggle over fences this term, labouring in fourth when he was almost brought down by Saint Davy at Ffos Las on latest outing; today's first-time headgear needs a huge response.

🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on worse than good to soft except on debut; won by wide margins in three-runner handicaps at Plumpton (about 2m4f) on first two starts over fences; his hurdles win was over 2m6f but he bled from the nose when trying that trip again at this track six weeks ago; needs to resume his improvement.

💬 Comment: Tailed off trying 3m on reappearance and whipped round at the start next time; chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Wore cheekpieces on last five outings, including third in the EBF Final at Sandown (2m4f, soft) last March; ended last term on a low note, then tailed off trying 3m at Cheltenham on return and latest appearance was a debacle when he whipped round at the start; he could still have potential, though, and this is his chase debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Won well in two novice hurdles in the mud at Wincanton last winter, latterly over an extended 2m5f; has looked in similar form switched to chasing this season, which he needs to improve on but he'd taken the measure of Saint Davy and Hillcrest when they came a cropper at Ffos Las last time, when he had a tongue-tie fitted, and this new trip might be within reach.

💬 Comment: Heavy fall latest; better over this sort of trip and looked promising going into that race
🔦 Spotlight: Point, bumper and hurdles winner who ran well in a Grade 2 novice at Sandown (3m, soft) in December on chase debut; beaten and tiring, however, when he took a heavy fall three out in Grade 2 at Ffos Las (extended 2m3f, soft) four weeks ago; that's a concern but he is better over this sort of trip and looked promising going into that race.

🔦 Spotlight: Wore cheekpieces on last five outings, including third in the EBF Final at Sandown (2m4f, soft) last March; ended last term on a low note, then tailed off trying 3m at Cheltenham on return and latest appearance was a debacle when he whipped round at the start; he could still have potential, though, and this is his chase debut.

💬 Comment: Bled from the nose here six weeks ago on hat-trick bid; needs to resume his improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on worse than good to soft except on debut; won by wide margins in three-runner handicaps at Plumpton (about 2m4f) on first two starts over fences; his hurdles win was over 2m6f but he bled from the nose when trying that trip again at this track six weeks ago; needs to resume his improvement.
