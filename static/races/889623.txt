üí¨ Comment: 3rd in Ayr Gold Cup off this mark last year; promise in one AW run; no great record fresh
üî¶ Spotlight: Habitual slow starter; failed to win in 2024 but he ran some fine races in defeat, including in top-end handicaps (third in the Ayr Gold Cup off today's mark); ran well in his only other AW start (5f, Newcastle); has the ability to feature but first time out perhaps not the day to catch him.
