üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Second chase win was at Cheltenham (extended 3m1f, good to soft); can resume improvement
üî¶ Spotlight: Has made a cracking transition to chasing, with handicap wins at Aintree (good) and Cheltenham (extended 3m1f, good to soft); firmly in charge in the latter from turning for home, never threatened by the strong-finishing runner-up Transmission; creditable return to hurdling last time; should stay and can resume his improvement.

üí¨ Comment: Plenty of promise; highly interesting if effective on the likely very different ground
üî¶ Spotlight: 2023 point winner whose second win over hurdles early last year came stylishly in a 3m Grade 2 novice at Haydock (heavy); that's his best performance (four chases since) but latest was a major echo (on soft; just behind Captain Cody) and showed plenty of promise; highly interesting if he's effective on what's likely to be very different ground.

üí¨ Comment: Jumps fences rather ponderously but he's well handicapped and likely to stay
üî¶ Spotlight: Had an excellent hurdles campaign last term, going agonisingly close in the Pertemps Final at this meeting (3m, soft; 6lb lower today); his first go at fences under rules was in 2022 and he's having another crack at it this season, last time threatening to get competitive three out at Windsor when making a mistake and also badly hampered; jumps rather ponderously and has more to prove away from soft ground but he's well handicapped and likely to stay.
