🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second chase win was at Cheltenham (extended 3m1f, good to soft); can resume improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Has made a cracking transition to chasing, with handicap wins at Aintree (good) and Cheltenham (extended 3m1f, good to soft); firmly in charge in the latter from turning for home, never threatened by the strong-finishing runner-up Transmission; creditable return to hurdling last time; should stay and can resume his improvement.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Plenty of promise; highly interesting if effective on the likely very different ground
🔦 Spotlight: 2023 point winner whose second win over hurdles early last year came stylishly in a 3m Grade 2 novice at Haydock (heavy); that's his best performance (four chases since) but latest was a major echo (on soft; just behind Captain Cody) and showed plenty of promise; highly interesting if he's effective on what's likely to be very different ground.

💬 Comment: Has taken well to chasing over 3m+ at this track and looks a 🎖️ major contender over new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Has taken well to chasing over 3m+ on good/good to soft at this track this term, arriving late on the scene; never a threat to Haiti Couleurs on latest chase start (extended 3m1f) but finished strongly for second; well beaten in Grade 2 hurdle race last time but he's a lot more interesting back in this sphere and should have a big shout.

💬 Comment: 0-6 over fences under rules; 2nd when upped to 3m3f at Punchestown (soft) last time though
🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 over fences under rules; blinkered on last three starts when fifth, sixth and second in major Irish handicaps over 3m+; failed to capitalise on a rival's bad blunder on latest but that was improved form when upped to 3m3f in the Grand National Trial at Punchestown (soft) and he was 13l clear of the third; looks well capable of getting seriously involved.

💬 Comment: Jumps fences rather ponderously but he's well handicapped and likely to stay
🔦 Spotlight: Had an excellent hurdles campaign last term, going agonisingly close in the Pertemps Final at this meeting (3m, soft; 6lb lower today); his first go at fences under rules was in 2022 and he's having another crack at it this season, last time threatening to get competitive three out at Windsor when making a mistake and also badly hampered; jumps rather ponderously and has more to prove away from soft ground but he's well handicapped and likely to stay.

🔦 Spotlight: Won three successive handicap hurdles last winter and two in a row at about 3m over fences (Newbury and Windsor) this winter; those improved efforts came to an end when he only struggled into third back at Newbury one month ago, which makes others much more persuasive today.

🔦 Spotlight: Ridden by his owner; major progress when switched to chasing this winter for small-field handicap wins over 3m at Taunton (good to soft) and Ascot (good); found his revised mark at Sandown (3m, heavy) a bit too much in hat-trick bid but again ran well and staying beyond 3m may be possible.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper three years ago but 0-12 since; while he was competitive over fences last season and his fourth at 50-1 in the Scottish National (4m, soft; 5lb lower today) last April reads well, a poor sequence since seems to confirm he's no Superman; headgear goes on for the first time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Game, front-running win in first-time cheekpieces at Taunton (2m7f, soft) on latest start
🔦 Spotlight: Scored at Exeter (3m, good to soft) in October on second attempt over fences and brushed two lesser efforts aside with a game, front-running win in first-time cheekpieces at Taunton (2m7f, soft) five weeks ago; up 4lb but stays 3m well and could have more to offer.
