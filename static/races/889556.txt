💬 Comment: 5f win at Chelmsford in November before a C&D second to Solar Edge; below par last time
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning nursery debut at Chelmsford (5f; tongue tied for the first time) in November; chased home Solar Edge over C&D one month later but she turned in a lacklustre display at Southwell ten days later; returns from a break with Rossa Ryan retaining the ride; still has low mileage.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor form for L Mullaney last autumn but tumbled down weights; 🆕 new yard try a visor
🔦 Spotlight: Came to hand early for the Coles as a 2yo, including a 5f Polytrack win on debut; poor form in three runs for Lawrence Mullaney last autumn but dropped 11lb as a result; starts out for 🆕 new yard (same owners) with a visor fitted and she's one to note for market confidence.
