🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Progressed well since handicapping in headgear but is 4lb higher than when last winning
🔦 Spotlight: Progressed well since handicapping in headgear, kicking on again for the drop to 6f in blinkers latterly; saying that he's been turned over as favourite six times in his last nine starts and it's possible he's reached his ceiling now (4lb higher than when last winning).
