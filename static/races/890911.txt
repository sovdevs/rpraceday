🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unplaced over 6f at the Curragh on Sunday, highly dependable here in recent months
🔦 Spotlight: Has been in fine form over 6f and 7f at this venue lately; won a claimer and finished close up in three handicaps before winning decisively on the second of three starts last month; backed that up with another second placing a week later; now back on his favoured surface after a 6f run at the Curragh on Sunday.
