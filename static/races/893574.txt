🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m4f maiden winner here before no show in Albert Bartlett; Townend's pick on handicap bow
🔦 Spotlight: Improved jumping under forcing tactics to land 2m4f maiden here in January (soft) but never counted in 3m Albert Bartlett Novices last month, a stiff task; Townend's pick entering handicaps here and one of the least exposed.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Fairyhouse (20f): "Fishery Lane is a strong stayer I would say. He will improve on the job regarding his jumping, and I would see him going up in trip rather than dropping back - Paul Townend."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tramore maiden winner remains on a nice mark with likely more to offer upped in trip
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive mare twice runner-up in 2m handicaps before nice bit of improvement when upped to 2m6f in Tramore maiden six days ago, readily going clear before last (yielding); good chance she'll get this longer trip too and remains on a nice mark.
Horse quote: 2025-04-13 at Tramore (21.5f): "Fairyland Opera absolutely deserved it and she ran unbelievable races at Naas and Navan, bumping into two very good horses. It didn't do her handicap mark any good so we said we'd go back to a maiden. They either stay or they don't and handle Tramore or not but she did both just fine. She's gorgeous. The plan was always to step up in trip and she'll probably have one more run before her holidays - Lorna Fowler, trainer."

💬 Comment: Up 6lb for C&D win early this month but could be the type to keep improving
🔦 Spotlight: Won over 2m4f at Sligo earlier in the season and most recently posted career-best in winning over C&D early this month (good-to-yielding); 6lb rise but could be the type to keep improving.
Horse quote: 2025-04-06 at Fairyhouse (24f): "The Miracle Man is a tough horse, he's from that Carrigeen [Kamala] family and they stay. He seems to like that ground. At one stage I was thinking we might let him off but they wouldn't be running on faster than that during the summer so we'll keep him out for a while - Arthur Moore, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-12-15 at Navan (25f): "I'm delighted with Blaze The Way. He won his bumper and was placed over hurdles. I think he's a stayer and the last day we kind of rode him the wrong way in a better race. I've liked him for a while and I wasn't surprised to see that. We won't go again quickly with him, there might be something at the Thyestes meeting for him. We'll see how he improves from here - Mags Mullins, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-12-31 at Uttoxeter (23.5f): "Andy Amo will be a lovely three-mile chaser next season. We wanted to step him up in trip and he's stayed well. We'll stick to hurdles this season, maybe give him a couple of runs and then put him away. It'd be nice if he could win a novice under a penalty and then we could think about something better - Rebecca Curtis, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hexham maiden winner; stamina test should suit but opening mark looks on the high side
🔦 Spotlight: Listowel bumper winner (2m4f) for Eugene O'Sullivan; promise first two hurdle runs before readily landing lesser 2m Hexham maiden last month; good chance he'll improve for this stamina test but opening mark on the high side.
Horse quote: 2025-03-25 at Hexham (16f): "Road To Home's jumping at speed needs work as at the second-last and the last he was a bit careful. I don't mind that too much, but I wanted to win as easy as I could because we might go to Fairyhouse and Punchestown with him. I think he's a nice horse - Patrick Mullins, rider, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Likes a stamina test but ideally wants better ground
🔦 Spotlight: Likes a stamina test, winning 3m Kilbeggan maiden last summer and 2m7f Bangor novice handicap in November; soft ground probably didn't suit when last seen in December so legitimate ground concerns here.
Horse quote: 2024-07-26 at Kilbeggan (24.5f): "Beaufort Scale didn't put a foot wrong anywhere today, he jumped brilliant. We went a really good gallop and when I asked him he picked up, and did it well at the line - Sam Ewing, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Staying-on C&D sixth recently; could improve under a more positive ride
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m4f maiden here and scored in handicap company over 2m6f at Thurles last month on good ground; seemed to be ridden to stay trip here on latest when never nearer sixth; cheekpieces now tried, ideally wants better ground.
Horse quote: 2024-10-12 at Fairyhouse (20.5f): "That's fantastic and I'm delighted with Born Bright. She won a point-to-point and my son got to ride her in a few bumpers but she wants good ground and it went soft in Sligo and Listowel. This was a race that really suited and it was local. She'll run away over hurdles now - Claire O'Connell, trainer."
