🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seriously lacking in experience but there's plenty of the scopey stayer about him
🔦 Spotlight: Won by a fraction in the 3m novice handicap hurdle on this card last year off 7lb lower in a first-time hood (tried twice since); only one echo of that form in his four races since, when third in a beginners chase, but he seemed to be running well when unseating four out in a Grade 2 last time; seriously lacking in experience but there's plenty of the scopey stayer about him and he has been the favourite this week, for Willie Mullins of course.
Horse quote: 2024-03-05 at Thurles (16f): "Chosen Witness is a fine big horse. He can be a bit ignorant at one or two hurdles but he has loads of scope and should jump a fence - Sean O'Keeffe, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stuck to his task very well when second in the 3m6f NH Chase at Cheltenham latest outing
🔦 Spotlight: Sole chase win from eight attempts was in a three-runner handicap at Doncaster (3m, good) in November; stuck to his task very well when second in the 3m6f NH Chase at Cheltenham (good to soft) on latest outing, with blinkers replacing cheekpieces, and that demands some respect.
Horse quote: 2023-01-28 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Speaking to Tom (Scudamore) there we will probably step Rock My Way up in trip. He wanted a bit more of a lead and he got to the front early enough and he had a look around. We could have done with a bit more of a pace there. We had Way Out in the race as well and at home he runs all over this horse every day. I might need to put a longer gallop on! I thought if we can get him in the top three I won't look stupid for the entries we have made for the Ballymore and the Albert Bartlett and I'm glad about that. We will get him home and see where he is really - Syd Hosie, owner-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All form in the mud; won this by a nose last year; 5lb higher now; out of form this term
🔦 Spotlight: All his form is on soft or heavy ground, including two handicap wins last April and the second of those was this race by a nose from Surrey Quest (always prominent); 5lb higher today but the chief worry is that he's been so horrendously out of form this season.
Horse quote: 2024-04-20 at Ayr (32f): "That's one photograph I'll be taking home with me! I thought Macdermott had it won, then in the last stride I thought we were done. I was disappointed but I knew we had a nice bit of money. Then one of my owners in the box put up the betting on the photo and our fellow was 13-1 on, then that contracted down to 3-1 on. It's fantastic for Danny and I'm delighted for Pat Gallagher too because it's taken this horse a long while. He's only six and with his pedigree his best years will be seven, eight and nine. He has Aintree written all over him. The way he jumped today I'd love to bring him to Paris for the Grand Steeplechase - when you win, you have all sorts of plans! Halfway around I was thinking he was jumping too well for the speed they were going. Danny kept the lid on him as long as he could. But for the little peck at the last, I imagine he might have won easy enough - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 2m4f Grade 2 novice hurdle win last term and he stayed 3m well when third at Navan (soft) on penultimate chase start; more to prove on good or good to soft and also after unseating with more than a circuit to go in the 3m6f NH Chase at Cheltenham (12-1), leaving him as a dark horse from top stable.
Horse quote: 2024-03-31 at Fairyhouse (20f): "Jody was very good. She minded her own business and kept Captain Cody balanced and jumping. She's always there riding winners all the time for us. When you consider how light she is, she must have to carry a stone and a half of lead every day - Willie Mullins, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-12-13 at Doncaster (24f): "I think cheekpieces helped The Kniphand loads today. He's always shown us at home he's able to jump a fence really well but it hasn't always come together on the track. He gave the race away at Ludlow by ballooning some of them and it nearly happened early on at Southwell so it was brilliant today that he got into a nice rhythm and every time I asked him he came up for me - Finn Lambert, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won by 6l at Newbury (3m2f, good to soft; 6lb higher today) in December; excuses last time
🔦 Spotlight: Has looked sure to stay beyond 3m2f but pulled up in the 2024 NH Chase at Cheltenham (3m6f, heavy) on sole attempt to do so; won by 6l at Newbury (3m2f, good to soft; 6lb higher today) in December; always in the first two that day and he was disadvantaged when slowly away (from a standing start) back at Cheltenham Festival last month, well beaten in eighth but he did earn some marks for challenging three out; not dismissed.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Newbury (26f): "Henry's Friend jumped well today and we know he stays all day. He's got a good heart and he tries, and I was pretty confident from three out. It was nice to see him pull out and hit the line hard. He loves it here. He looks to be improving again and it's onwards and upwards with him. He was an improving novice but he went off the boil when he got to the festival last year. The National Hunt Chase was probably the wrong race, but the Coral Gold Cup has put him right and he's going the right way - Tom David, assistant trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has looked sure to stay beyond 3m2f but pulled up in the 2024 NH Chase at Cheltenham (3m6f, heavy) on sole attempt to do so; won by 6l at Newbury (3m2f, good to soft; 6lb higher today) in December; always in the first two that day and he was disadvantaged when slowly away (from a standing start) back at Cheltenham Festival last month, well beaten in eighth but he did earn some marks for challenging three out; not dismissed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disputing third when final-fence faller in the 3m6f NH Chase; cheekpieces first time today
🔦 Spotlight: Five chases; overcame major adversity to pull it out of the fire for his second chase win (2m6f, soft) at Windsor this winter; fourth at Ascot (good) on his first attempt at 3m and he was again running creditably, disputing third, when final-fence faller in the 3m6f NH Chase at Cheltenham on latest outing; needs to build on that and connections reach for cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2023-11-20 at Leicester (20.5f): "Hasthing was quite novicey. He has plenty to learn really but he's a good galloper and it was nice just to see him do it. He'd probably go on better ground. He's a big horse and it takes a little bit of time to get organised but he did it okay in the end. We thought we had a nice horse so hopefully he'll go on - Jonjo O'Neill, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Placed off career-low mark (3lb higher today) on last two outings; unraced beyond 3m1f
🔦 Spotlight: Thrown in judged on his form in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons; not so hot from last April onwards but placed off a career-low mark (3lb higher today) over 3m on good ground on last two outings; on his way back up the ladder but unraced beyond 3m1f.
Horse quote: 2023-04-22 at Ayr (24f): "We won this three years ago with Molly The Dolly and we've had it in mind we wanted to come back for it with Sail Away. I had him entered for the Scottish National but that may be next year. He loves nice ground, his jumping counted for a lot and he was a fresh horse.

💬 Comment: Placed off career-low mark (3lb higher today) on last two outings; unraced beyond 3m1f
🔦 Spotlight: Thrown in judged on his form in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons; not so hot from last April onwards but placed off a career-low mark (3lb higher today) over 3m on good ground on last two outings; on his way back up the ladder but unraced beyond 3m1f.

💬 Comment: Up to 3m4f in Dublin National at Leopardstown and challenged late to score in tidy style
🔦 Spotlight: The moves up to 3m1f, 3m2f and 3m4f on varied ground in his last three starts have all resulted in improved form; on latest he was held up in rear in the 14-runner Dublin National at Leopardstown and challenged at the final fence to score in tidy style; today's much higher mark includes 4lb out of the handicap, but another significant advance can't be ruled out.
Horse quote: 2025-03-02 at Leopardstown (28.5f): "Brandt has been lucky and unlucky. He won on the first run for us, but I think he should have two more won since as he fell one day and probably got to the front too soon the last day and got lonely but it's great to get that today. The Ulster National is in a month's time at Downpatrick and if he got into it, that would suit perfect - Cian Collins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrow lead at the final fence at Doncaster two starts back only to fall; 11th in Kim Muir
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth start for Gary Brown when he returned to form in a useful handicap at Doncaster (3m, good) in January, only to fall when he'd taken a narrow lead at the final fence; 11th when 7-1 for the Kim Muir at Cheltenham next time, on final start for that stable, in which he was not disgraced (in contention turning for home) but this is his first crack at a marathon trip and others have more pressing claims.
Horse quote: 2022-01-19 at Newbury (16.5f): "Walking On Air's dam stayed and Nico says this fella will stay. He's nice, but had some hold-ups - no big problems - and he's going to be spectacular. He'll jump a fence and might be very exciting in a year or two. Nico says he'll go two and a half, but he'll need another run before the festival. He could go somewhere with a penalty, although there is the Sidney Banks, but we've others for that - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the 3m4f Grand National Trial at Haydock two starts back; appealing candidate for 4m
🔦 Spotlight: Improved in first-time cheekpieces (kept since) to win the Grand National Trial at Haydock (3m4f, good to soft; 3lb higher today) in February, asserting well on the run-in; sixth of 24 at Cheltenham was creditable when back to 3m1f last month and he's an appealing candidate for 4m; good claims.
Horse quote: 2025-02-15 at Haydock (28.5f): "Famous Bridge was only ticking over when he unseated last year. He's always been a grand horse, a good stayer who'll stay all day. He'll miss the cut for the National this time, which is a shame as we'd love to go to Aintree. Hopefully it might be next year. He could be one for the Scottish National but he wouldn't want it too fast. He'll probably go to Cheltenham now. He ran a good race in the Ultima last year and is probably just coming to himself now - Nicky Richards, trainer."

Horse quote: 2025-02-02 at Musselburgh (31.5f): "It's really nice to get Magna Sam back. He had some issues last season, we were just missing something. We did it [his wind] after his break and obviously it's showing dividends now. He had a little blow at the back of two out at Doncaster and it was a nice confidence-booster for him - Alastair Ralph, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Rallied to win at Newbury (extended 2m6f, good to soft; 4lb higher today) in November after slow jump at the final fence; nothing of that ilk before or since and while he did plug on for seventh in the 3m2f Kim Muir at Cheltenham last time, this much longer trip does not significantly boost his prospects.
Horse quote: 2024-11-30 at Newbury (22.5f): "Wiseguy won his first chase down at Exeter last season but at the end of the season his jumping went to pieces. I ended up putting back over hurdles and he couldn't even jump them. He had back issues and all sorts of things. This was an ambitious place to come but he jumped and travelled well today and we've got him back. We'll just creep forward from here - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

💬 Comment: Stayed on well for third in this in 2023 off 1lb higher; resurgent to win latest start
🔦 Spotlight: Never better than when staying on well for third in this race in 2023 (good) off 1lb higher; mostly well out of form since and his score over fences is just 2-18 but the second win was at Limerick (2m7f, good to yielding) on latest start and he did it well to re-enter serious calculations.
Horse quote: 2022-10-30 at Galway (22.5f): "I've always loved Flash De Touzaine but he's just a bit mentally fragile, although is going the right way. He jumped beautifully here. He was a bit novicey last season and we rode him more positively as we wanted to try something a bit different. Hopefully he is a National type of horse and you'd hope he'll take a step forward with more experience - it was only his fifth run over fences. He's a pure natural with an obstacle coming to him. Paul (Nicholls, previous trainer) had a few issues with him but mentally he's coming forward the whole time. I was very pleased they allowed me to take him back. I think he's one to look forward to - Liz Doyle, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Close to his best with placed efforts this winter but this 10yo probably needs a new high
🔦 Spotlight: 11th in the 2023 National at Aintree on his sole attempt beyond 3m2f; won two valuable 3m handicaps on good ground in that 2022-23 season and has been close to his best with placed efforts this winter, but this 10yo probably needs a new high if he's to win today.
Horse quote: 2023-02-25 at Kempton (24f): "I've got no real faith in the runners at the moment just with how the form of the yard is. However, this lad stays forever. I was a bit worried down the back straight but when I saw Our Power turning in, I was quietly confident. He would have run in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury but he had a little setback and we had no other option but to train him for this, which is a fantastic race itself. I'd say he would be doubtful to get in at Aintree so it will be Cheltenham for the Ultima then he will either go for the Scottish National or the bet365 Gold Cup - Sam Thomas, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd in the 2024 Midlands National; mostly back to his old tricks since by refusing to race
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up off this mark for Willie Mullins in the 4m2f Midlands Grand National last March; that, however, was the last time he's completed and he's mostly been back to his old tricks since by refusing to race; last two "starts" were for new connections but he didn't start at all on the first of those and threw in the towel at a later point three weeks ago.
Horse quote: 2024-03-16 at Uttoxeter (34f): "It was a super run off top weight on his return. Mr Incredbile has an awful lot of ability and I'd imagine we'll go back to Aintree. The saddle slipped going around the Canal Turn, and he was going nicely at that point, so the whole plan for the season has been to get him back for that - Patrick Mullins, stable representative."
