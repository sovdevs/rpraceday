🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 2 winner at 2m7f, arguably sets the standard with her second in the Albert Bartlett
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £120,000 after a debut point win; impressed in winning her first two hurdle races; landed a 2m5f maiden at Punchestown before displaying plenty of stamina in winning a 2m7f Grade 2 at Limerick; arguably sets the standard with her second behind Jasmin De Vaux in the Albert Bartlett, rallied well having been hampered after two out; suited by soft ground.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (24f): "We're delighted with The Big Westerner; she ran a blinder. She just got into a little bit of trouble at the second-last, but ran really well. I very much hope she's a chaser in the making - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Strong stayer on the Flat, pegged back by Air Of Entitlement at Cheltenham, strong chance
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner and very useful Flat stayer (third in the 2024 Irish Cesarewitch on good ground); jumped well when making a winning hurdles debut over an extended 2m2f on yielding to soft at this venue in January; travelled strongly to the final flight before being worn down late by Air Of Entitlement at Cheltenham; trip should suit, strong contender if handling the ground.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (17f): "Sixandahalf ran really well - jumped and travelled really well everywhere, and probably just could have done with something to lead her a bit further. I did think after jumping the last that she was going to go away and win. I suppose there was a target on my back then. She jumped brilliantly and didn't do anything wrong - she just got beat - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fine effort to beat Sixandahalf at Cheltenham, trainer's The Big Westerner may be too good
🔦 Spotlight: Point/bumper winner; easy winner over this trip at Down Royal at Christmas when too quick for Ballybow, a subsequent Grade  winner over 3m; no problem with the shorter distance (2m1f) when beating the favourite Sixandahalf in the Grade 2 mares' novice at Cheltenham; trainer also saddles the Albert Bartlett runner-up The Big Westerner who may prove too good.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (17f): "We knew Air Of Entitlement had the stamina and the New Course suits horses with that. We always worry about being too handy in that race, but Rachael was spot on. I thought they went a real good gallop and she gave her some spin. It was a little bit like Telmesomethinggirl a few years ago.  We weren't as far back as we normally are, but she stayed on really well. I thought when we winged the last we had a chance. I knew Keith (Donoghue on Sixandahalf) had been up there the whole way and historically that hasn't worked as we have had a couple that did that. I always say I prefer coming here fresh and happy rather than feeling that I have to justify myself coming here - Henry De Bromhead, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lost all chance at the start at Cheltenham, should not be out of place in this grade
🔦 Spotlight: Unchallenged to win her first two races at Punchestown, a soft-ground bumper early last year and, 12 months later, a heavy-ground maiden hurdle in which her jumping became more polished as the race progressed; denied a chance to prove her worth after a shambles of a start at Cheltenham; should not be out of place in this grade.
Horse quote: 2025-01-27 at Punchestown (19.5f): "Maughreen put up a huge performance for a mare having just her second run. She went out and made her own running, jumped from hurdle to hurdle, made a couple of little mistakes including at the last when Paul was happy to let her fiddle it - Willie Mullins, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Daughter of multiple Cheltenham Festival winner Quevega, sister to the top-class Facile Vega; three-time bumper winner; 3-5 over hurdles this season, most significant success when beating Dream On Baby over 2m2f here in January; plenty to prove after mid-field finish behind Air Of Entitlement at Cheltenham.
Horse quote: 2025-01-25 at Fairyhouse (18f): "I was really taken by that performance. I thought Aurora Vega would come on a lot for the last day but I was not expecting her to do that. She looks like one we might keep for the 2m4f Grade 1 mares hurdle here at Easter. That would be foremost in my mind - Willie Mullins, trainer."

Horse quote: 2025-02-09 at Navan (20f): "Tareze is improving all the time. She is a big mare and is much stronger this season. That was a very good performance, she travelled well behind the pace and picked up well.

💬 Comment: Second to Aurora Vega in a 2m2f Grade 3 event at this venue, faded in 2m6f Limerick event.
🔦 Spotlight: Left her bumper form well behind when bolting up over 2m7f at Thurles on stable/hurdle debut in November; marked drop in trip when third in 2m Listed mares' novice at the same venue; did well when chasing home Aurora Vega in a 2m2f Grade 3 event at this venue; faded quite tamely over an extended 2m6f at Limerick.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner and subsequent 320,000euros purchase; made amends for previous failures with maiden win at Navan; not a likely contender at this level.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Navan (16f): "I was there a long way out but I was staying on and I still had a fair chance. Swing Davis was unlucky to fall the last day and I was staying on well that day as well. Two and a half isn't a problem and she jumps very well so she'll jump a fence in time -  Sam Ewing, jockey, talking to Racing TV."
