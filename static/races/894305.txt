🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11lb higher and deserves to be at the head of the betting but drying ground is a concern
🔦 Spotlight: Both career victories have come at Gowran on soft or heavy ground, including a dominant 2m handicap chase victory there in March when seeing off a next time out winner; now 11lb higher and deserves to be at the head of the betting but drying ground has to be a concern.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Gowran Park (16f): "Darragh [O'Keefe, jockey] was brilliant on Champagne Mahler and the horse was tough. The horses are starting to run a bit better now after we had a frustrating month or six weeks but they're coming through it. We're getting there and hopefully it's good timing ahead of next week. It's a brilliant prize to win. He wanted a day where he could run both the horses [Captain Ryan Matt finished second in the opening maiden hurdle] and I was blue in the face telling him there are easier races for them! He loves that ground and won his handicap hurdle here on Thyestes day last year. We always felt he'd be a better chaser - Henry De Bromhead, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2-winning hurdler got off the mark over fences at the fourth time of asking when landing standard Cork beginners' (2m1f, yielding) 11 days ago, doing it from the front; won't be allowed to dictate things here but opening mark is fair and is another worthy of respect for the Mullins stable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual Grade 2 hurdles winner in his pomp; nowhere near that level now despite a win latest
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Grade 2 hurdles winner in his pomp back in 2020/21; missed two full seasons before returning in October 2023 and hasn't looked the same horse, though he has won twice this season, including 2m beginners' chase at Wexford last month; handicap chase debut; others preferred.
Horse quote: 2024-10-15 at Punchestown (18.5f): "Aspire Tower obviously missed a bit of time and came back and it's great to see him go do that. He likes a nice gallop and he picked up from the bend when I got stuck into him. He jumped well and enjoyed himself. I was happy with the way he lengthened away coming to the last and he'll definitely come on for it - Darragh O'Keeffe, rider, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdler who won his first two chases (including over C&D) under positive rides and returned to those tactics when a highly respectable fifth in the Grand Annual at Cheltenham, his first handicap in this discipline; would have been a lot closer without a late mistake; part of a strong hand for Henry de Bromhead.

🔦 Spotlight: Quite highly tried over fences to date, notably finishing second in a Grade 3 at Roscommon last September; didn't jump well and hampered when pulled up on handicap debut at Leopardstown; won a 2m2f Thurles beginners' under positive tactics on latest but this will be much tougher.
Horse quote: 2022-10-20 at Thurles (15.5f): "A Law Of Her Own has been very consistent from day one and has improved away. I knew I was turning her back out quickly but the way she travels in her races, I wanted to come here and we got away with it. She battled hard and I think she will be a lot better over hurdles - Peter Fahey, trainer."

💬 Comment: 📈 progressive horse couldn't dominate at Kempton but is on the shortlist back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Had wind op prior to Carlisle in October, when pulled up and found to have a wound on his right hind; major improvement when easily making all at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) and Ffos Las (2m, soft), the latter effort marked up as he jumped to the right; couldn't dominate upped to 20.5f at Kempton but is on the shortlist back in trip.
Horse quote: 2025-01-11 at Ffos Las (16f): "That was very impressive and it looked to me like Keep Running was in second gear the whole way. He still had his ears pricked going to the last. He loves his jumping and every time he sees a fence he eyes light up and he's gone. I think he's got a really bright future. He's still a young horse who doesn't have many miles on the clock - Warren Greatrex, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yard 3-12 at Punchestown in last five seasons so would be no surprise to see him run well
🔦 Spotlight: Won with a bit up his sleeve at Doncaster (good) off 122 in January 2024; 2lb out of the weights and absent for 399 days when fifth of nine over the same C&D in March; stable 3-12 at Punchestown in the last five seasons so would be no surprise to see him run a big race.
Horse quote: 2024-01-27 at Doncaster (16.5f): "We always liked Gabriel's Getaway early on but he was a bit of a hothead. He took a bit of time to mature but he won three out of three over fences then he got a bump at Bangor and ran too free and the ground was too soft for him at Ludlow last time. He was in at the deep end today but he's done it well. They cut each other's throats and he saw it out well - Ben Godfrey, jockey."

💬 Comment: In good form; nothing went his way at Aintree four weeks ago but he could go well here
🔦 Spotlight: Lost his way at the end of last season but returned with a win at Fairyhouse (2m1f, yielding) off 126 in November before being beaten a short head by An Peann Dearg (won at the DRF since) at Leopardstown on St Stephen's Day; nothing went his way at Aintree four weeks ago but he could go well here.
Horse quote: 2024-11-30 at Fairyhouse (17f): "The Folkes Tiara had lost his form a little but great to see him back. His jumping was unreal. Brian thought he was beaten coming to the last but he just winged it. He was brilliant - Henry de Bromhead, trainer"

Horse quote: 2024-03-31 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "Captains Nephew just didn't see out his race at Thurles the last day, I'd say the track was too quick for him. His form up to then has been mighty and this is the race I'd had in mind for him for a fair while - Philip Rothwell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 1-16 over fences; ran well at Gowran in November (2m, good) but badly out of sorts in four starts since, including when finishing last of eight in Fairyhouse novice 11 days ago; ground will be more suitable here but he's hard to fancy.
Horse quote: 2022-05-02 at Down Royal (16.5f): "Gaelic Arc is a funny horse, difficult to train, and a horse you wouldn't have a punt on. He's going to be a lovely horse over a fence. The ground today probably suited him and was the key today. Niall Prendergast gave him a cracking ride and he'll go over fences now - John Ryan, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up at Naas in January & finished tailed off at Limerick in March; hard to recommend
🔦 Spotlight: Doesn't hang about on the front end; defied an absence to win at Kilbeggan (2m4f, good) last August off 117 but was pulled up at Naas in January and finished tailed off at Limerick in March; difficult to recommend on that evidence.
Horse quote: 2022-07-15 at Killarney (17f): "That was the plan with The Dara Man. Danny (Mullins) gave him a super ride. He's had a few issues, but we've appeared to get on top of them, and he looks a fair horse going forward. He'll run in novice chases for the rest of the summer. There's probably something in Galway for him - John Ryan, trainer."
