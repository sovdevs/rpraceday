💬 Comment: Came good for this stable when dropped to 6f last week; still 🔍 unexposed as a sprinter
🔦 Spotlight: Not an instant success for Dylan Cunha this year but evidently well suited by drop to a stiff 6f when scoring at Leicester (good) last week; not yet tested on ground quicker than good but remains 🔍 unexposed as a sprinter.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up over 6f on latest AW start and looks well treated off 7lb lower turf mark
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from spell in Ireland with two good AW runs under Kenny Roussety for new stable in March, the latter a second over 6f; looks well treated off his 7lb lower turf mark here; major player.
Horse quote: 2022-07-06 at Fairyhouse (7f): "The Cola Brasil is a big gangly horse that takes a bit of organising. He stayed at it well and won it well. He's in again on Sunday and I might run him - Mick Browne, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Emphatic soft-ground C&D winner last spring; returns from 203-day break today
🔦 Spotlight: Racing mainly over 6f since emphatic C&D win on soft ground just over a year ago and absent since struggling over 1m on heavy ground in October; resumes on a good mark but would make much more appeal on a slower surface (particularly over this trip); blinkers the headgear of choice today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In pretty good form on AW this year; each-way claims at least off his higher turf mark
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who scored over 6f on Tapeta in February and has largely remained in good form on AW since; competes off his higher turf mark here but was a fast-ground course winner (albeit over 5f) off just 1lb lower last summer; each-way claims at least.
Horse quote: 2020-09-02 at Bath (5.5f): "Under Curfew travelled beautifully. I was told to follow our other horse [Bezzas Lad] but he went off too quick. We slotted in and he couldn't try any more for me ? I couldn't stop screaming from two out - Mollie Phillips, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced all six starts; returned from break with quite encouraging run in first-time cheekpieces at Wolverhampton (7f, AW) in March but finished last after racing too freely over that C&D last month; now drops back to 6f for first time since last summer's debut and is tried in a visor.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed over C&D last summer but has lacked fizz on the AW this year
🔦 Spotlight: Now 9lb lower than when placed over C&D (good to firm) last summer but has lacked fizz on the AW this year and switches back to turf with quite a bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2021-07-03 at Naas (6f): "We thought he would need the run. He was a bit sick after the run the last day (tenth at Fairyhouse at the end of May) and I'd say he's probably better fresh. He stayed at it well. There is a race for him at Fairyhouse next Sunday, a six furlong 0-70 handicap. He's a good fun horse, very honest and stays going. Every time he ran up to now there was a problem with the draw but today everything worked to plan - Michael Brown, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: On the downgrade now and made a low-key seasonal reappearance on Tapeta last month but is very well handicapped on some of last year's fast-turf form; contender if that recent outing brought her on.
