💬 Comment: Has run well when second the last twice; likes it here and he's a solid candidate
🔦 Spotlight: Bumped into Myretown when second of four here (2m7f, soft) last month and again ran well when runner-up at Ayr (2m4f, soft) a fortnight ago; won on good ground here over hurdles and has gone close over 3m2f here in that sphere; can give another good account and he's a solid candidate.

💬 Comment: Impressed in 3-runner novice at Wetherby in November and possible excuses the next twice
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't shone the last twice but has had possible excuses, namely soft ground then a marathon 3m7f trip; won a novice hurdle here last season and he impressed in a three-runner novice chase at Wetherby (3m, good) in November; could have a part to play if tapping back into that promise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a handy mark but can refuse to race, which was the case on stable debut in December
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up off this mark for Willie Mullins in the Midlands Grand National last March; however, he can often be reluctant at the start and he refused to race on his stable debut at Wetherby in December; very risky.
