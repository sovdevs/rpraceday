🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below form when warm favourite last time but remains of interest in this type of event
🔦 Spotlight: Useful Flat racer who ran to fair level when placed on first two hurdling starts, and was probably a shade unlucky when second over C&D (soft) on latter occasion; disappointing favourite when well-held third at Kempton (2m, good to soft) since but remains of interest in this type of event.

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointed at Windsor in January (made a respiratory noise; had wind op soon afterwards) but was second in handicaps at Sandown (2m, soft) and Ascot (1m7f, good to soft) towards end of last year and has strong claims in this maiden if back on song.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point winner; settled better when second at Southwell in December; more needed here
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner; raced far too freely before weakening into remote third on rules debut in November but, with a hood fitted, settled better when second at Southwell (2m, good to soft) the following month; needs to improve again here but that's possible.
