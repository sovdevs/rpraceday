🔦 Spotlight: Made it four in a row (including a handicap hurdle win) when landing a Limerick event two weeks ago; began his sequence off a lowly 78, now promoted to 106; breakthrough came with a 25l win, has scored by a short head (over C&D) and a neck on his last two starts; tough sort, likely to be in the mix again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1-16 record over fences is a concern, fair placed form, cheekpieces now, each-way prospect
🔦 Spotlight: 1-16 record over fences is a concern but placed eight times; fair form this term, including when third behind today's rival One Horse Army over 3m2f at Fairyhouse; stays well and seemed to find 2m4f inadequate at Gowran last time; first time with cheekpieces; place prospect.

🔦 Spotlight: Ran only twice in 2024; justified support in a handicap chase over just short of 3m on good ground at Downpatrick in May; jumped badly and afterward reported lame behind when beaten favourite at Punchestown the following month; jumped poorly and pulled up at Fairyhouse in January on return.
