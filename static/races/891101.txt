üí¨ Comment: Punchestown win last autumn came on good ground, fourth off lower hurdles mark on latest
üî¶ Spotlight: Won a handicap chase over this trip at Punchestown last autumn on good ground; set some stiff tasks after in search of black type; disappointing back hurdling at Punchestown in January, but ground was probably too testing; beaten 10l in fourth off her lower hurdles mark at Thurles 12 days ago.
