🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't run on turf since 2022; in fair form of late and has a 5lb lower mark on grass
🔦 Spotlight: Wins have all come on the AW, mainly at Lingfield, and he hasn't run on turf since 2022; has been in fair form of late, without much luck, and has a 5lb lower mark on grass, so a case could be made in a weak handicap.
Horse quote: 2019-01-31 at Southwell (AW) (5f): "Coolagh Magic jumped out well and when I asked for a change of gear, he'd gone. He's always worked quite well and is probably getting quicker, having won over five here - Tony Hamilton, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Won five for Dylan Cunha in the early months of last year, latterly off a 2lb higher mark; finished well held for her 🆕 new yard early in the month and faded quickly back down to 5f having led at one stage yesterday (both at Wolverhampton).
Horse quote: 2024-05-01 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "We paid five grand for Gogo Yubari at the mares' sale and we've won five races and had two places from ten starts in four months; it's been unreal - Dylan Cunha, trainer."

💬 Comment: Well treated back on turf; the return of the usual headgear/tongue-tie is a positive too
🔦 Spotlight: It's not hard to argue she's better on turf than the AW and she's well treated, being 7lb lower than when going close over C&D last summer (behind Rebel Star's half-sister Angle Land); the return of the usual headgear/tongue-tie is a positive too.

💬 Comment: Hasn't shone in his two starts here; didn't offer any immediate promise on comeback
🔦 Spotlight: Has gained a lot of his wins later in the year and hasn't shone in his two starts here; resumed on the AW a fortnight ago weighted to his best after two wins last autumn and didn't offer any immediate promise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled hard when a well-beaten last for his 🆕 new yard (AW) last month
🔦 Spotlight: Dual 2yo winner for Ed Dunlop but struggled during a limited campaign last season before being sold for 8,000gns; the handicapper's proving quick to ease off but he pulled hard when a well-beaten last for his 🆕 new yard (AW) last month.
Horse quote: 2023-09-09 at Wolverhampton (AW) (5f): "I wanted to take a lead but Hint Of The Jungle latched on with me and I didn't want to take him back. He battled on and stuck his head out towards the line and he's really professional - Morgan Cole, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
