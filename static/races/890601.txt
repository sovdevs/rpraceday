🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1-19 but placed in his last three starts; 4lb wrong, but still more appealing than a few
🔦 Spotlight: 1-19 with his win coming at Fakenham (2m, soft) early last year; placed in his last three starts at Fontwell including when second of seven over a similar trip to this (good) last month; 4lb out of the weights, but still more appealing than a few.
Horse quote: 2024-02-16 at Fakenham (16.5f): "We thought going out on to the last circuit that Elpologreg would get there as the others went off too fast, but that has to be the ride of the season - Seamus Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: May have had excuses for two defeats since winning in good style at Lingfield; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins over fences, the latest a comfortable success at Lingfield (2m7f, soft) in February; twice held since, but the race may have come too soon at Ludlow a week later while 3m7f appeared to stretch him at Chepstow last time; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-02-20 at Lingfield (23.5f): "I couldn't believe the price difference between Felton Bellevue and Twilight Glory because they've run against each other quite regularly. He didn't run badly at Sedgefield the other day. I expected them to go a gallop there, but it just turned into a bit of a sprint - Ben Case, trainer."
