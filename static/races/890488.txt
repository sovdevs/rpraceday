🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark on fourth start over fences at Chepstow last time (2m7f, good; reportedly appreciated the quicker ground); chance despite 6lb higher mark.
Horse quote: 2025-03-20 at Chepstow (23.5f): "To carry that weight was a really good performance. It was almost like a summer's day today and Redbridge Rambler loves having the sun on his back and good ground. He comes alive at this time of the season. James [Best] gave him a lovely ride ? he never got tempted in going for glory too early and timed it to perfection - Martin Keighley, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won six races on good/good to soft last year, five of them over fences including two over this C&D; well beaten on last two starts, the latest in the Eider Chase on first run since wind surgery; down in grade.
Horse quote: 2024-12-14 at Newcastle (23.5f): "Chemical Warfare is a little bit on the edge. He's a forward-going, keen sort of type, and you have to put a bit of trust in him because sometimes you tell him what to do and he likes to do the opposite. I know him pretty well now, I've ridden him all through the summer - Jack Tudor, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2022-09-14 at Sligo (21f): "Broken Ice has been banging on the door and was entitled to win there with his chase mark. He stays well and will definitely stay further, and may even prefer slower ground - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Formerly useful; not as good these days and well beaten on stable debut on Monday
🔦 Spotlight: Useful performer in his prime with Willie Mullins; nothing like as good these days and fell in three of his five runs pointing last year; ran in snatches and didn't jump fluently when tailed off on stable debut at Kelso on Monday (200-1); plenty to prove at present.
Horse quote: 2019-05-22 at Wexford (25.5f): "He's honest anyway because, for a whole circuit, he didn't get a look at a jump but he kept jumping through. The loose horse went to run Dot Love's horse [The Mulcare Rover] at one stage but he jumped through again. The fences were the easy part - it was navigating the loose horses in between which was the hard bit - Paul Townend, rider"
