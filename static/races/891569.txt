🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well in this trial and the Queen Anne last year, taking Ascot record to 11322
🔦 Spotlight: Failed to make much of a splash globetrotting towards the end of 2024; ran well in this trial and the Queen Anne last year, taking his Ascot form figures to 11322; top on ratings in first-time tongue-tie.
Horse quote: 2024-10-26 at Moonee Valley (10f): "It looked like we were coming with a run to be a nice third but Docklands hasn't raced for a while and I think he has got a bit tired the last 200 metres. Asking him to really quicken and work around the bend into the straight probably wouldn't have been ideal, either. We'll see how he is in the morning but the plan would very much now be to run at Flemington in two weeks' time. We'll put him in the mile and the 2,000-metre [ten-furlong] races but I think we'll keep him to this distance, although I would be very happy either way. I think it was more fitness than him not staying today - Harry Eustace, trainer."

💬 Comment: Interesting, assuming his excellent progress (2111) on AW is transferred to turf
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily and produced a very useful handicap performance at Southwell when last seen, taking form figures (all over 1m on AW) to 2111; interesting, assuming his big progress is transferred to turf.
Horse quote: 2024-04-28 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "Sardinian Warrior did everything I expected of him. He was in front a long way from home, he was still green and he possibly got tired. I always knew he was going to come on for today so that was very encouraging - Kieran Shoemark, jockey."

Horse quote: 2023-11-03 at Santa Anita (8f): "River Tiber was our number one for sure, but there wasn't much between them. We then thought Unquestionable could win - Michael Tabor, part-owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not crying out for drop back to 1m and has to overcome a 3lb penalty to boot
🔦 Spotlight: Scored twice over this trip in 2022 but raced exclusively at further since and stays 1m4f; not crying out for the drop back to 1m and has to overcome a 3lb penalty (for Bahrain Listed win in January) to boot.
Horse quote: 2024-07-20 at Newbury (10f): "We bought Phantom Flight for the Bahrain International and just wondered whether he'd end up being rated high enough but he certainly will be now. He looks a really exciting recruit and the boss, Shaikh Nasser, gets all the credit. He lets me try and find horses wherever I can and he's so supportive and willing. He came to me in great condition and James Horton did a great job with him last year. We'll work back from Bahrain and I was thinking about the Ebor before then but the handicapper will have his say now. I'm going to have to slightly reevaluate now but he's a serious horse - George Scott, trainer."

💬 Comment: Fourth in last year's Queen Anne; frame possibilities if taking well to blinkers
🔦 Spotlight: Best known as a very useful 7f performer but showed good form twice over C&D last term, including fourth-place finish in the Queen Anne; frame possibilities, provided he takes to first-time blinkers.
Horse quote: 2023-08-19 at Newbury (7f): "I was intending to run Witch Hunter in the Great St Wilfrid but I put him in this as well as with the rain coming I thought I might not run Chindit and it might open up for him. I ran Chindit and it still opened up for him so I'm delighted.  He was unlucky not to win at the All-Weather Championships at Lingfield which I thought was his Derby. He's improved all year - Richard Hannon, trainer."

💬 Comment: May rate higher still; looks more interesting than the bare figures suggest
🔦 Spotlight: Ended last season with a useful handicap win at Doncaster; below-par favourite at Newmarket on reappearance but is lightly raced and may rater higher still; more interesting than the bare figures suggest.
Horse quote: 2024-04-15 at Windsor (10f): "The dream is still alive, so we'll see how we get on. I think Harper's Ferry warrants being put in a trial because he's bred to be that kind of horse as he's by a French Derby winner and out of an Oaks winner, so we have to stick him in and see where we are. He'll be a better horse in better races and he has a really high cruising speed. I'm very happy, it's a big relief really. I was disappointed he got beat at Doncaster. He's been shaping up well and he really improved for the run, but we were unfortunate to run into another one too good last time. The better ground here suited and the experience will help - Ed Walker, trainer."

💬 Comment: Peak effort at Ascot, namely close fourth in Group 2 over round 1m last July
🔦 Spotlight: Has something to find on most of his form but produced peak effort at Ascot, namely close fourth in Group 2 over the round 1m last July; return to this venue may have positive effect.
Horse quote: 2024-06-01 at Epsom (8.5f): "I thought it was a great run and Oisin [Murphy, jockey] was delighted with Royal Dubai. The winner is obviously a good horse and he probably had first run, so we had quite a lot of ground to make up. He finished strongly and handled the track, so we have to be pleased with that. He's a really nice horse and he's proven he's up to this level, so there's plenty to look forward to with him. Maybe Goodwood. Last year the only bad run came on soft ground. He wants good to firm, so we've been lucky it dried out today - Marco Botti, trainer."

💬 Comment: Second to notable rival on penultimate start but strike-rate remains unimpressive
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten when belatedly returned to AW last time, having been struck into on left hind; beat all bar rising 1m star Dancing Gemini at Doncaster on reappearance but strike-rate remains unimpressive.
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Newmarket (10f): "Checkandchallenge has run in some hot races this year and I don't think he has actually run a bad race in any of them. Dropping back into a Listed race today it was just nice to get his head back in front. I know the distance between them was a long way at Ascot the other day, but he was fourth in a Group One and he picked up a good bit of prize money and he had some nice horses behind him. I think a mile and a quarter is right for him. We went back for the stiff mile at Ascot as we felt on that track it was going to suit him and he got his just rewards. He can cope with those extremes out there today where a lot of other horses can't. He is in the Hong Kong Mile, but I think he deserves a nice break. There will be plenty of options for him next year. Horses like him can turn up in those Group One races that cut up a bit and pick up a bit of money. We might also look at those Group Three and Group Two races in France again next year - William Knight, trainer."

He loved the step up to a mile and a quarter, we probably should have done it earlier! He's in the International because if he was to win today we'd have said why wasn't he. It's such good prize money and it will have to be seriously considered. He's picked up a lot of place money and we'll see how he is - William Knight, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest win took his AW record to 5-13; he's 0-5 on turf and carries 3lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Career-best performance in 1m Listed event at Lingfield when last seen, taking AW record to 5-13; however, he's 0-5 on turf and is lumbered with 3lb penalty back in this sphere; not the percentage call.
Horse quote: 2025-02-07 at Lingfield (AW) (8f): "It was a small field and we were keen to ride Tyrrhenian Sea a bit more prominently. We know he handles the track and he had a fitness edge over the favourite - Jack Mitchell, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1m3f Listed winner; ✂️ gelded since last run; drop to 1m presents a question mark
🔦 Spotlight: Campaigned exclusively over longer trips and ran well in the 2024 Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot (1m6f) on the back of a 1m3f Listed win; ✂️ gelded since last run; this drop to 1m presents a question mark.
Horse quote: 2024-05-25 at Goodwood (11f): "\BMeydaan\P has been learning his trade as he's gone along this season and he deserved to get his head in front. He was in front soon enough and was looking around a bit but saw out the trip well. He has options at Royal Ascot, including the Queen's Vase, and we'll have a chat with connections - Simon Crisford, joint trainer."
