🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner (5f) in November; twice placed over this trip at Southwell & Newcastle since
🔦 Spotlight: Narrow winner on last visit to Wolverhampton (5f; 11-10 favourite) in November but, despite running respectably since in this headgear combination, hasn't exactly kicked on; Oisin McSweeney's 3lb claim is an asset in bidding to improve on a recent 6f Newcastle third.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all over 7f here (from 6lb lower) on penultimate start; this drop to 6f should suit.
🔦 Spotlight: Made all to justify favouritism over 7f here (from 6lb lower) on penultimate start and gave it another good go from the front when fourth subsequently; dropping back to 6f (0-5) looks a suitable avenue to explore given such a positive run style; one to seriously consider.

💬 Comment: Fourth at Thirsk (6f; tongue-tied) in September; off since (✂️ gelded and changed stables).
🔦 Spotlight: Ran his best race for Alice Haynes when fitted with a tongue-tie at Thirsk (6f, good to soft; fourth) in September; ✂️ gelded, and has moved to Stuart Williams; dam was a 6f AW winner, so he's worth another go on Tapeta; possibilities if ready to roll off a 155-day absence.

💬 Comment: Failed to get competitive on AW debut at Newcastle (5f; 33-1); eased 2lb since; 6f a plus?
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a Bath maiden (5.5f, good) in September, but disappointed on soft back there next time; failed to get majorly competitive on recent AW debut at Newcastle (5f; 33-1); has eased 2lb since, and her pedigree suggests that this extra furlong could suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Former stablemate of Inconspicuous; running well on sharp turf tracks mid-summer, including when scoring from a 2lb lower mark at Catterick (5f, soft; 11-2); must leave last month's Southwell comeback (also AW debut) behind to stake a claim; is entitled to strip fitter.
