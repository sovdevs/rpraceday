🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not one to rely upon heavily but was second at Catterick in February and has won over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Not one to rely upon heavily and would probably prefer ground slower than good but has a C&D win on her CV and returned to form with second at Catterick (1m7f, good to soft) in February; didn't run badly at Sedgefield last time (pulled up after penultimate-fence sprawl); a possible.
Horse quote: 2024-03-04 at Southwell (16f): "Zara's Universe won two last year and the handicapper has has given her a chance today, plus we've put that good young kid William (Maggs) on board. To be fair to Brian Hughes, he said to put the headgear on last time he rode her so we brought her down to two miles, put headgear on, and everyone's happy - Andrew Crook, trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual hurdle and multiple Flat winner; 0-10 over fences but on a tempting chase mark
🔦 Spotlight: Won on the Flat in the autumn and might have needed this month's reappearance run (over hurdles); 0-10 over fences but has been given a chance by the handicapper and conditions here will suit.
Horse quote: 2022-06-22 at Carlisle (8f): "Jackhammer has been running well for us over hurdles and at the start of the year we were struggling to find a rhythm and find races for him, but then he dropped into it at Perth and we had a nice couple of wins up there. He's been a great horse for us so we're delighted - Dianne Sayer, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Safely held on both outings this year (chase/hurdle) but now 8lb lower than when keeping on for modest third at Catterick (1m7f, good) in December; gained his hurdling win here (in 2023) and will be suited by today's return to good ground; not out of this if perked up by change of headgear.
