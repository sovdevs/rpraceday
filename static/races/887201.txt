🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Safely held in a Listed race last time but can still build upon his quite impressive debut
🔦 Spotlight: Raced too freely and seemed to have limitations exposed in Ascot Listed race in December but created pretty good impression when scoring at Wincanton (good) in October and is back in calmer waters here; respected.
