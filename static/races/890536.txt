🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy winner on hurdle debut; only third next time but remains very 🔍 unexposed under rules
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who easily justified odds-on favouritism in modest mares' maiden hurdle on rules debut at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft) in January; well held in third when again odds-on at Doncaster (2m3f, good) the following month but remains very 🔍 unexposed and could easily have improvement to come in handicaps.
Horse quote: 2025-01-16 at Newcastle (17f): "Queens Wish was good. I'm not sure the form of the race was super hot but it was good and she was good. She jumped nicely. We'll find another little novice event and see where we get to in the spring. It was nice to have a good start - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Took step back in right direction at Limerick this month and remains on a good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Lost his way after winning two 2m3f hurdles last spring (soft/good to yielding) but, having rejoined John Hanlon, took step back in right direction when respectable fifth of 17 at Limerick (2m3f, good) a fortnight ago; needs to build on that performance here but remains on a good mark.
Horse quote: 2022-04-06 at Nottingham (8.5f): "Seasett's work had been good and we think he has a bit more speed than his previous yard gave him credit for. He'll be a really fun horse this year - Charlie Fellowes, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: In excellent form when last seen, winning readily by 4l at Huntingdon (2m3f, good) last May; has fitness to prove after 340-day absence but subsequent 6lb rise does not look excessive; market may guide.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful on the Flat; won on hurdle debut in November but has gone the wrong way since
🔦 Spotlight: Useful Flat stayer; made bright start to hurdling career in November, winning by 6l at Doncaster (2m, good), but was turned over at short odds on next outing and finished well down the field on subsequent handicap debut; ought to be suited by today's step up in trip but needs the first-time cheekpieces to give him a good boost.
Horse quote: 2024-11-30 at Doncaster (16.5f): "We bought Campaign Trail at the sales last year and he had a hairline fracture on his pelvis literally the first day we schooled him, so we gave him the whole year off. Willie Mullins said to me at the time if he was his, then he'd be out in the field, although he did actually end up that way because we couldn't train him. They've [Its Only Money ownership group] been incredibly patient. It's a big investment and they've got something to look forward to - Kim Bailey, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on both starts for Jennie Candlish during winter and, having rejoined Sophie Leech, was pulled up at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) last month; eased in grade again but remains difficult to enthuse over.
Horse quote: 2020-12-01 at Southwell (16f): "Lucky One is a lovely horse. He travelled really well and jumped great. He was very keen over two and a half miles last time and the drop back to two miles has suited him well. He'll be a nice chaser one day and is one of the horses that has come from Willie Mullins that is quite exciting. I could see him going the right way with experience - Harry Cobden, jockey."
