🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Excelled himself when fourth in Aintree Grade 1 last month; ought to win this easily
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful Flat racer who has taken very well to hurdling this season; comfortably justified odds-on favouritism at Newbury (2m, soft) in February and excelled himself when fourth in Grade 1 at recent Aintree festival (2m1f, good to soft); likely to collect this prize with minimal fuss.
Horse quote: 2025-02-28 at Newbury (16.5f): "Apart from the last, Give It To Me OJ jumped well. He was going a bit left-handed, but that might have been because the front horse was going left-handed. Through no fault of his own he's had a messed up season, but he needed that run the other day when he was second - Gary Moore, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: Placed in low-grade 1m4f AW handicap last month; makes hurdle debut
🔦 Spotlight: 0-19 on the Flat but was placed off a much reduced mark at Southwell (1m4f, AW; RPR 60) last month and is evidently in good heart.
