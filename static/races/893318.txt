🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdler who won his first two chases under positive rides and returned to those tactics when a highly respectable fifth in the Grand Annual at Cheltenham, his first handicap in this discipline; would have been closer than 7l without a late mistake.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good mark on his RPRs and forget last time as was found to be coughing
🔦 Spotlight: His first two wins over fences included a defeat of this week's impressive Cheltenham winner Theatre Native; RPRs suggest he could be on a useful mark and forget last time as was found to be coughing.
Horse quote: 2025-02-20 at Punchestown (16f): "Springt De La Mare jumped really well and it was a good performance. I was just saying to Keith there that we couldn't win a maiden hurdle with him, but he's taken to this better. He jumps really well and got through that ground well. He won his bumper and looked like he was going to be very smart, but he just lost his way a little bit in the middle part of his career. Hopefully, we're back on track. He doesn't qualify for some of the bigger handicaps yet with only two runs, so I'm not really sure where we go now - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Got himself a bit too far back before running on into sixth in the Grand Annual
🔦 Spotlight: Useful hurdler; off the mark over fences in a novice at Down Royal and got himself a bit too far back before running on into sixth in the Grand Annual (one place behind Jasko Des Dames); enters the reckoning.
Horse quote: 2025-01-21 at Down Royal (16.5f): "Conyers Hill is a hold-up horse and tends not to find too much. He was sticky enough at a few of his fences, but he had to battle today and held the second to the line. He might head on to Cheltenham for the novice handicap chase - Paul Nolan, trainer."

💬 Comment: Her jumping was better when third of 11 in a 2m handicap at Gowran last time
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive when winning three hurdles on the spin last season; 0-5 as a chaser but her jumping was better when third of 11 in a 2m handicap at Gowran last time and she's on a nice racing weight.
Horse quote: 2024-02-07 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Miss Pronunciation is starting to settle a lot better and that's bringing out the improvement in her. She loves that ground, her mother Adarma did too - Padraig Roche, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Impressed in winning handicap chases at Naas (yielding) and Clonmel (yielding to soft) and had jumped well out in front before falling late on at Navan (2m7f), where he was headed but boxing on; expect another positive ride back at this distance.
Horse quote: 2024-03-10 at Naas (15.5f): "Hillsdale is a quirky horse but Keith (Donoghue) did a great job. He battled today and he's a big horse who'll go chasing next season. The owner, Brian Pierce, is a great supporter of ours - Philip Dempsey, trainer."

💬 Comment: 2m4f too far in the Plate at Cheltenham; tough mark but he's back at the right trip
🔦 Spotlight: Third in last season's Grand Annual and the 2m4f of the Plate looked a step too far at this year's festival; stuck on a tough mark but back over the right trip he's entitled to have some say.
Horse quote: 2024-10-25 at Cheltenham (16f): "I'm delighted, Path d'Oroux was banging on the door so many times last season and didn't win but got a lot of experience. It was a messy race, they went very slow and then turned into a sprint but he came out of it well. He's probably not good enough to mix it with the Grade 1 novices but at the same time he's experienced. In the early season in against some he may just have the upper hand. This was the plan for a while - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced and the winner of a maiden hurdle and a beginners' chase, looking good at Limerick over Christmas (2m1f, yielding to soft); not sure what happened in a novice last time at Punchestown (sent off favourite) but he's better than that and brings potential into handicaps.
Horse quote: 2024-12-26 at Limerick (17.5f): "Release The Beast is a horse we have always liked and this is his job. He is a different horse since he came back in this year and had a lovely run the first day. It was only a rated novice but he is definitely a nice horse - James Nolan, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Essentially disappointing given his initial promise and he's now 0-5 over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Essentially underwhelming given his initial promise and made it 0-5 over fences when the disappointing favourite in a 2m4f Listed handicap at Navan in early March; would have a chance on his third at Leopardstown over Christmas but not sure the recent rain will have been welcomed.
Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Leopardstown (16f): ""I chose No Flies On Him as a three-year-old at the Derby sales when JP very kindly let me pick one out and he sent him for his education with Derek O'Connor, who did a fantastic job with him. He has a wonderful pedigree and he looks like a very promising horse. I've had a lot of swans over the last few years who have turned out as geese but I think this fella might stay a swan! He will have to be entered in Grade 1s after this and hopefully he might get there - Edward O'Grady, trainer."

💬 Comment: Triple hurdle winner and now 2-3 over fences after an emphatic handicap win at Limerick
🔦 Spotlight: Triple hurdle winner and now 2-3 over fences after an emphatic handicap win at Limerick (2m2f, good) where his jumping was excellent; up 5lb in a hotter race here but firmly in the reckoning under Rachael Blackmore.
Horse quote: 2024-11-21 at Thurles (22.5f): "Drumgill went disappointing over hurdles but probably got sick of it. Philip Donovan rode him the last day and wasn't too hard on him and we freshened him up since. He is a brilliant jumper, loved that good ground and we thought he'd run okay - John Ryan, trainer."

💬 Comment: Versatile gelding who has the class to make his presence felt off top weight
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile gelding who ran well on the Flat last time after a break; 1-3 over fences and didn't quite get home in a 2m4f Grade 3 on final run in this discipline; has the class to make his presence felt off top weight.
Horse quote: 2024-09-09 at Galway (18.5f): "Jesse Evans was foot perfect the whole way round, indeed the mistake he made at Killarney is the only one he has ever made and it probably did him good. He is a good ground horse and my dream for him would be to come back next year for the Galway Plate - Noel Meade, trainer"

💬 Comment: Wheels have come off but he's back in distance after a break and could easily fare better
🔦 Spotlight: Won his first chase at Gowran in October and later ran okay in a Grade 3; the wheels have come off since (including a Naas handicap last time) but he's back in distance after a break and could easily fare better.
Horse quote: 2024-03-23 at Navan (15.5f): "We probably won't do much more with Rainbow Trail now and he'll head over fences next season. He's honest, he jumps and he stays - Gordon Elliott, trainer."
