🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6lb penalty but back in serious calculations after winning well at Plumpton on Monday
🔦 Spotlight: Had been languishing this season prior to winning a ten-runner novice handicap at Plumpton (extended 2m4f, good) on Monday, leading before the final flight and going nearly 5l clear; has 6lb penalty but firmly back in serious calculations.
Horse quote: 2025-04-21 at Plumpton (20.5f): "I didn't think Mostly Sunny would run badly at all, he just wanted a bit better spring ground. The step up in trip and cheekpieces, it all helped him that little bit. I love to see it, he's entered at Sandown and he'll be going there, that's penned in now - Dan Skelton, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won handicap debut at Naas (2m3f) and good second of five at Ayr (3m); promising
🔦 Spotlight: Picked up well to make a successful handicap debut at Naas (2m3f, soft) in March, justifying favouritism in 16-runner race; good second of five at Ayr (3m, good to soft) two weeks ago and this step back down in trip may help with further progress; promising.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Free-going sort; questions over the trip and how well handicapped he is, but Townend rides
🔦 Spotlight: Free-going sort and that seemed to cost him in the Coral Cup at Cheltenham (2m5f) on his only run beyond 2m1f; sixth of 12 in hot 2m race at Ayr two weeks ago was as good as any of his form, which showed that better is needed, but Paul Townend nevertheless takes the ride.
Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Limerick (16f): "Bunting is a nice horse, he did everything well and showed a lovely attitude. He jumped well, just had a little look over the last two, but he did it well - Sean O'Keeffe, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Creditable sixth in big-field handicaps at the Cheltenham (extended 2m4f) and Aintree (3m) festivals on his last two outings; he needs to find extra, however, and this test may well be on the sharp side.
Horse quote: 2023-11-22 at Warwick (21f): "To see your homebred win is just fantastic. I've bred some nice horses from his dam Tara Rose, but Push The Button is by far the best. He just keeps improving and has achieved plenty for a four-year-old - Jimmy Wenman, owner-breeder."

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins last term, most notably in this race (good) and he did that in good style off 4lb lower than today; less reliable this season but never-nearer fifth of 20 at Aintree (2m4f; hooded first time) on latest start was a hint that he could be a player in this race for the second year running.

🔦 Spotlight: Seventh attempt to get off the mark over hurdles when scoring in a big-field Limerick maiden (2m3f, soft) last month; creditable front-running second in novice at Cheltenham (2m4f, good) ten days ago and looks a reliable sort, but this handicap debut demands more from him.
