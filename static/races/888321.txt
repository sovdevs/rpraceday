🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Up 8lb for handicap debut win but this lightly raced 6yo could have more left in the tank
🔦 Spotlight: Point runner-up who was dropped back in trip for recent handicap debut at Southwell (2m, good to soft) and showed improved form to win by just over 3l from a next-time-out winner; up 8lb but this lightly raced 6yo could have more left in the tank.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Underwhelming over fences last time but won over hurdles prior to that; could bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: Won on chase debut at Hexham (1m7f, soft) in October and easily landed a selling handicap hurdle at Fakenham (2m, good) in February; underwhelming when back over fences at Newcastle eight days later but no surprise if he bounces back with a good run today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Encouraging signs at Market Rasen recently and could benefit from the drop back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: His form has been patchy since last summer's two wins (both 2m) but there were encouraging signs at Market Rasen (2m4f, good to soft) 16 days ago on his second outing since wind surgery, where he shaped as though he would benefit from this drop back in distance; attractively handicapped.
