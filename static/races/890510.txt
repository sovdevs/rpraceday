💬 Comment: 2-2 over hurdles, the latter win gained in pretty good style at Sedgefield on Boxing Day
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 over hurdles, the latter win gained in pretty good style at Sedgefield (2m4f, good to soft) on Boxing Day; moves up in trip today and needs to be taken very seriously.
Horse quote: 2024-12-26 at Sedgefield (20f): "Sign Again is a nice horse. We'll take our time with him as he's a bit of a baby still but he's good. The Jennie Candlish horse [Pigeon House] had some good form but we were carrying 5lb less, so it was the right thing to do to take our chance and see what we could do. He'll be a nice chaser in time, so we won't hurry him. I think we'll try off a double penalty next with a claimer on although we might take a look at the Sidney Banks - Charlie Longsdon, trainer."

💬 Comment: Not much has gone to plan over fences but his best hurdling form puts him in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Made little impact in beginners' chases on last three outings (unseated rider twice) but showed some fair hurdling form last year, perhaps most notably when second in a 12-runner Tramore maiden (2m5f, good) in August; has a part to play here if somewhere near his best.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not much has gone to plan over fences but his best hurdling form puts him in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Made little impact in beginners' chases on last three outings (unseated rider twice) but showed some fair hurdling form last year, perhaps most notably when second in a 12-runner Tramore maiden (2m5f, good) in August; has a part to play here if somewhere near his best.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won here (2m3f) three weeks ago but the value of that form is open to question
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French 5yo who came good over hurdles at sixth attempt, with comfortable success in six-runner course maiden (2m3f, good) three weeks ago; however, the value of that form is open to question (short-odds favourite disappointed) and he contests a deeper race today; new trip.
