🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10yo who has a regressive profile but this 6-time C&D winner has dropped down the weights
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who has a regressive profile; however, this six-time course winner hasn't run badly here the last twice, most recently three weeks ago after a break, and continues to drop down the weights; possible player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Ayr in January; lesser run there since but not ruled out in first-time tongue-tie
🔦 Spotlight: Reverted to fences with a win at Ayr in January; a lesser run followed when fourth of six there last month but perhaps the first-time tongue-tie will help this afternoon and he's not ruled out.

🔦 Spotlight: Two-time course winner, including this race two years ago; also scored here last March and is well treated on that form, but this 12yo has been pulled up or well beaten on his four outings since; major turnaround required.
