🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very classy in 2021; last month's easy point win hints he could be on the way back
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten/pulled up on his two starts last season, following a long absence; however, he won a Grade 1 novice hurdle in April 2021 and also looked very promising over fences later that year; last month's easy point-to-point win hints he could be on his way back; intriguing candidate.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not the force of old and no match for Jet Plane in recent hunter chase at Wetherby
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful hurdler in his prime but this 10yo isn't the same force nowadays and was no match for Jet Plane in a hunter chase at Wetherby (3m, soft) a fortnight ago; others are preferred.
