💬 Comment: On four-timer; kept finding more at Cheltenham (3m, soft) on latest start; major interest
🔦 Spotlight: Has come to himself in a major way this autumn/winter, winning from the front at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft), Bangor (2m7f, soft) and Cheltenham (3m, soft); they were dominant displays on first two occasions and he kept finding more on latest; up another 6lb but remains of major interest.

💬 Comment: The former high hopes for him are not yet forgotten but he is raised 7f in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; favourite for handicap back over hurdles at Newbury (2m) later in November, never threatening from off pace but he did manage fifth of 13; the former high hopes are not yet forgotten but going up 7f in trip has to look an experiment with uncertain results.

🔦 Spotlight: Upped to about 3m this season and has done well; would probably have won at Chepstow over Christmas had he not hung badly right on the run-in, and he made amends with a doughty performance to win at Wincanton three weeks later; up another 4lb but should be thereabouts.

🔦 Spotlight: Ended a golden spell in 2021 with 2m4f Grade 2 novice win for Tom Lacey; travelled smoothly long way when 50-1 at Newbury (up to 3m, soft) in November for new yard, fading into fourth of 11 which leaves stamina to prove but any lack of fitness would be understandable on that first run for 1066 days; interesting.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick in spring 2023 but has been chalking up the seconds since; two of those have been at this track in this race last year and a 3m chase on penultimate start (has worn cheekpieces this term); form dipped at Windsor latest and he's probably vulnerable if back on song for this return to hurdling.

💬 Comment: Proved herself at 2m4f last time; this trip is new but she has a stout pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: Has mixed hurdling with chasing; two wins and two seconds from four runs at Exeter; proved her stamina for about 2m4f (fourth attempt) for the first time when second over fences at Windsor on latest outing; whether she'll get this new trip is far from certain but she has a stout pedigree, indeed her dam was a C&D winner.

🔦 Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; favourite for handicap back over hurdles at Newbury (2m) later in November, never threatening from off pace but he did manage fifth of 13; the former high hopes are not yet forgotten but going up 7f in trip has to look an experiment with uncertain results.

💬 Comment: 16l win here (near 2m6f); kept on relentlessly to follow up at Newbury (3m, again soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Eighth attempt over hurdles saw his first win when he finished 16l to the good in handicap at Exeter (near 2m6f); kept on relentlessly to follow up at Newbury (3m, again soft) two weeks later; ridden this season by Callum Pritchard; going up the weights in leaps and bounds but needs major respect.

🔦 Spotlight: Ended a golden spell in 2021 with 2m4f Grade 2 novice win for Tom Lacey; travelled smoothly long way when 50-1 at Newbury (up to 3m, soft) in November for new yard, fading into fourth of 11 which leaves stamina to prove but any lack of fitness would be understandable on that first run for 1066 days; interesting.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick in spring 2023 but has been chalking up the seconds since; two of those have been at this track in this race last year and a 3m chase on penultimate start (has worn cheekpieces this term); form dipped at Windsor latest and he's probably vulnerable if back on song for this return to hurdling.

💬 Comment: Proved herself at 2m4f last time; this trip is new but she has a stout pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: Has mixed hurdling with chasing; two wins and two seconds from four runs at Exeter; proved her stamina for about 2m4f (fourth attempt) for the first time when second over fences at Windsor on latest outing; whether she'll get this new trip is far from certain but she has a stout pedigree, indeed her dam was a C&D winner.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick in spring 2023 but has been chalking up the seconds since; two of those have been at this track in this race last year and a 3m chase on penultimate start (has worn cheekpieces this term); form dipped at Windsor latest and he's probably vulnerable if back on song for this return to hurdling.
