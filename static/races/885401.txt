🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On four-timer; kept finding more at Cheltenham (3m, soft) on latest start; major interest
🔦 Spotlight: Has come to himself in a major way this autumn/winter, winning from the front at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft), Bangor (2m7f, soft) and Cheltenham (3m, soft); they were dominant displays on first two occasions and he kept finding more on latest; up another 6lb but remains of major interest.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The former high hopes for him are not yet forgotten but he is raised 7f in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; favourite for handicap back over hurdles at Newbury (2m) later in November, never threatening from off pace but he did manage fifth of 13; the former high hopes are not yet forgotten but going up 7f in trip has to look an experiment with uncertain results.

🔦 Spotlight: Upped to about 3m this season and has done well; would probably have won at Chepstow over Christmas had he not hung badly right on the run-in, and he made amends with a doughty performance to win at Wincanton three weeks later; up another 4lb but should be thereabouts.

🔦 Spotlight: Has come to himself in a major way this autumn/winter, winning from the front at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft), Bangor (2m7f, soft) and Cheltenham (3m, soft); they were dominant displays on first two occasions and he kept finding more on latest; up another 6lb but remains of major interest.

🔦 Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; favourite for handicap back over hurdles at Newbury (2m) later in November, never threatening from off pace but he did manage fifth of 13; the former high hopes are not yet forgotten but going up 7f in trip has to look an experiment with uncertain results.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Travelled well long way when 50-1 fourth at Newbury (up to 3m, soft) after 1066 days off
🔦 Spotlight: Ended a golden spell in 2021 with 2m4f Grade 2 novice win for Tom Lacey; travelled smoothly long way when 50-1 at Newbury (up to 3m, soft) in November for new yard, fading into fourth of 11 which leaves stamina to prove but any lack of fitness would be understandable on that first run for 1066 days; interesting.
