💬 Comment: On four-timer; kept finding more at Cheltenham (3m, soft) on latest start; major interest
🔦 Spotlight: Has come to himself in a major way this autumn/winter, winning from the front at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft), Bangor (2m7f, soft) and Cheltenham (3m, soft); they were dominant displays on first two occasions and he kept finding more on latest; up another 6lb but remains of major interest.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The former high hopes for him are not yet forgotten but he is raised 7f in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; favourite for handicap back over hurdles at Newbury (2m) later in November, never threatening from off pace but he did manage fifth of 13; the former high hopes are not yet forgotten but going up 7f in trip has to look an experiment with uncertain results.

🔦 Spotlight: Upped to about 3m this season and has done well; would probably have won at Chepstow over Christmas had he not hung badly right on the run-in, and he made amends with a doughty performance to win at Wincanton three weeks later; up another 4lb but should be thereabouts.

🔦 Spotlight: Eighth attempt over hurdles saw his first win when he finished 16l to the good in handicap at Exeter (near 2m6f); kept on relentlessly to follow up at Newbury (3m, again soft) two weeks later; ridden this season by Callum Pritchard; going up the weights in leaps and bounds but needs major respect.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick in spring 2023 but has been chalking up the seconds since; two of those have been at this track in this race last year and a 3m chase on penultimate start (has worn cheekpieces this term); form dipped at Windsor latest and he's probably vulnerable if back on song for this return to hurdling.

💬 Comment: Proved herself at 2m4f last time; this trip is new but she has a stout pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: Has mixed hurdling with chasing; two wins and two seconds from four runs at Exeter; proved her stamina for about 2m4f (fourth attempt) for the first time when second over fences at Windsor on latest outing; whether she'll get this new trip is far from certain but she has a stout pedigree, indeed her dam was a C&D winner.

🔦 Spotlight: Big reputation going into this season but unsettled in the preliminaries when pulled up on seasonal/chase debut; favourite for handicap back over hurdles at Newbury (2m) later in November, never threatening from off pace but he did manage fifth of 13; the former high hopes are not yet forgotten but going up 7f in trip has to look an experiment with uncertain results.

🔦 Spotlight: Eighth attempt over hurdles saw his first win when he finished 16l to the good in handicap at Exeter (near 2m6f); kept on relentlessly to follow up at Newbury (3m, again soft) two weeks later; ridden this season by Callum Pritchard; going up the weights in leaps and bounds but needs major respect.

💬 Comment: 2nd in this last year and in 3m chase here on penultimate start; form dipped last time
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick in spring 2023 but has been chalking up the seconds since; two of those have been at this track in this race last year and a 3m chase on penultimate start (has worn cheekpieces this term); form dipped at Windsor latest and he's probably vulnerable if back on song for this return to hurdling.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick in spring 2023 but has been chalking up the seconds since; two of those have been at this track in this race last year and a 3m chase on penultimate start (has worn cheekpieces this term); form dipped at Windsor latest and he's probably vulnerable if back on song for this return to hurdling.
