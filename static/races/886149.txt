🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked promising before a flop when hot favourite for handicap debut at Haydock (2m, soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Fell at the last in his point-to-point and did so again at Bangor (2m, good to soft; form boosted) in November when he would probably otherwise have made all; made amends in some style when 8-11 in maiden at Uttoxeter (2m, soft) in December but flopped when hot favourite for handicap debut at Haydock (2m, soft) last month; looked promising before that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fifth on handicap debut (2m4f, soft) but it was a bold show from the front; down in class
🔦 Spotlight: Delivered on promise shown last spring when clearcut winner of a Warwick maiden hurdle (2m5f, good to soft) in December; creditable fifth of ten on handicap debut at Windsor (2m4f, soft) might suggest he's not on a great mark, but he makes some appeal judged on that performance (bold show from the front) and is down in class for this second handicap.

🔦 Spotlight: Best form on last two starts, albeit still beaten 13l when 40-1 fifth of 11 on handicap debut at Chepstow (extended 2m3f, heavy) on latest; dropped 3lb and may be capable of better.

📝 Comment: 🔄 midfield, outpaced 5th, reminder 3 out, tenderly handled from 2 out, kept on approaching last, never on terms (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said his instructions were to drop in 🔄 towards rear with the intention of finishing strongly; having jumped well over first few hurdles, gelding was flat out as field progressed down the hill and into back straight, unable to make any ground on those in front; having jumped the third last he used his whip on one occasion and gelding began to hang right-handed and continued to do so up home straight; when questioned on his inactivity from turning in, he said this was down to gelding hanging; trainer's rep was unaware of the instructions which had been given by the trainer over the phone and had no further opinion to offer; jockey said he had spoken to trainer over the phone after the race and trainer was satisfied with ride, adding that the focus was on finishing his race strongly but having gone through gelding's previous runs with rider, there appeared to be little difference in tactics and/or riding, who despite already running the required three times over hurdles as stated in paragraph 13 of the 'Weights and Handicapping Code', had not been allocated a handicap mark)

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful on Flat and won a Catterick maiden hurdle (2m, soft) last February; refused to race on handicap hurdle debut last April and put firmly in his place by a class act when back to hurdling over C&D in December; work to do but this is a drop in class.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Did well last year; perhaps hindered by soft ground last time; up another 3lb
🔦 Spotlight: Ridden by Eleanor Williams on last four starts; won four handicap hurdles last May-November and pushed a notably 📈 progressive rival hard at Ludlow (2m5f, good to soft) in December; weak 16-1 at Chepstow over Christmas when taking his first backward step for a while, perhaps hindered by soft ground; up another 3lb but drying ground could bring him back into the equation.

💬 Comment: Backward steps in the autumn over fences; first hurdle race since a novice win in May 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Won here (2m) last January and at Kelso (2m1f) last May but he returned from a break with three backward steps in the autumn; all those were over fences and he now has his first hurdle race since a novice win in May 2023; even his current, reduced chase mark is 8lb higher than this one over hurdles.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lack of achievement in recent seasons (last ran March 2023) but he's way down the weights
🔦 Spotlight: Two hurdles wins in Ireland in 2020; lack of achievement in recent seasons (last ran March 2023) is off-putting but he's way down the weights.

💬 Comment: Handicap debut; last seen in May 2023 for Oliver Sherwood, posing a major question
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a bumper and two of his three maiden hurdles also showed plenty of ability, enough to make this opening handicap mark look interesting; those were up to May 2023 for Oliver Sherwood and the absence gives him a major question to answer.

💬 Comment: Looked promising before a flop when hot favourite for handicap debut at Haydock (2m, soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Fell at the last in his point-to-point and did so again at Bangor (2m, good to soft; form boosted) in November when he would probably otherwise have made all; made amends in some style when 8-11 in maiden at Uttoxeter (2m, soft) in December but flopped when hot favourite for handicap debut at Haydock (2m, soft) last month; looked promising before that.

🔦 Spotlight: Delivered on promise shown last spring when clearcut winner of a Warwick maiden hurdle (2m5f, good to soft) in December; creditable fifth of ten on handicap debut at Windsor (2m4f, soft) might suggest he's not on a great mark, but he makes some appeal judged on that performance (bold show from the front) and is down in class for this second handicap.

📝 Comment: 🔄 midfield, outpaced 5th, reminder 3 out, tenderly handled from 2 out, kept on approaching last, never on terms (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said his instructions were to drop in 🔄 towards rear with the intention of finishing strongly; having jumped well over first few hurdles, gelding was flat out as field progressed down the hill and into back straight, unable to make any ground on those in front; having jumped the third last he used his whip on one occasion and gelding began to hang right-handed and continued to do so up home straight; when questioned on his inactivity from turning in, he said this was down to gelding hanging; trainer's rep was unaware of the instructions which had been given by the trainer over the phone and had no further opinion to offer; jockey said he had spoken to trainer over the phone after the race and trainer was satisfied with ride, adding that the focus was on finishing his race strongly but having gone through gelding's previous runs with rider, there appeared to be little difference in tactics and/or riding, who despite already running the required three times over hurdles as stated in paragraph 13 of the 'Weights and Handicapping Code', had not been allocated a handicap mark)

💬 Comment: Handicap debut; last seen in May 2023 for Oliver Sherwood, posing a major question
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a bumper and two of his three maiden hurdles also showed plenty of ability, enough to make this opening handicap mark look interesting; those were up to May 2023 for Oliver Sherwood and the absence gives him a major question to answer.
