🔦 Spotlight: March foal; 12-1 for the Brocklesby on debut and ran well to finish fifth, outpaced 1f out but keeping on nicely in the closing stages; open to improvement with that behind him and his experience will be an asset; drawn against the stands' rail but the runners raced up the middle of the track at the last meeting here.

💬 Comment: Green and well beaten on recent Newbury debut; only 6-1 there and should do better in time
🔦 Spotlight: Prominent in the market ahead of his Newbury debut (5f, good) a fortnight ago but having been held up early, he was under pressure before halfway and looked green, allowed to coast home in the final furlong; should be capable of better but still not easily recommended.
