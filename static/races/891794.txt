💬 Comment: Little wiggle room off this mark and she'll need the breaks from the outside stall
🔦 Spotlight: Won on debut last spring (7f here) and followed suit on this year's comeback, when going in easily off 5lb lower at Kempton; there's little wiggle room off this mark and she'll need the breaks from the outside stall under 7lb claimer Andrea Pinna.

💬 Comment: Will need to improve on her recent yard debut (over C&D) but this is a bit easier
🔦 Spotlight: Won five for Dylan Cunha in the early months of last year, latterly round here off a 2lb higher mark; will need to improve on her recent yard debut (over C&D) but this is a bit easier.
Horse quote: 2024-05-01 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "We paid five grand for Gogo Yubari at the mares' sale and we've won five races and had two places from ten starts in four months; it's been unreal - Dylan Cunha, trainer."
