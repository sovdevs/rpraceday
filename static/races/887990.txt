💬 Comment: Creditable 2nd to subsequent winner in only his 2nd run over 6f; contender off same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden; no progress since handicapping but he's run only twice over 6f and was taking on an improved subsequent winner when runner-up at Chelmsford (first-time visor, retained) last month; likely contender off same mark.

💬 Comment: First 6f run since winning as a 2yo but speedy and bold show likely
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't run over 6f since winning at Doncaster as a 2yo but he doesn't lack for speed, racing freely in front over 7f here recently before overhauled inside the final furlong; bold show looks likely; refitted eyeshield/blinkers join the hood.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner last month; good 2nd to well-treated rival since; lesser effort latest
🔦 Spotlight: Has won on four of the five AW tracks, most recently over C&D in January before close up behind a well-treated rival (dead-heated since) one week later; not so good latest though so hard to call this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced; her early handicaps were over 1m but she wasn't caught out for pace dropped to 6f here in December before getting off the mark over 7f at Southwell last month; failed to find much on final start for Jack Jones but should still have some 6f potential; cheekpieces on.

🔦 Spotlight: Losing run goes back to May 2022 but she ran her best race for a while when close up on the return to 6f at Southwell in January; not so effective there on Friday which gives her more to prove this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Has won on four of the five AW tracks, most recently over C&D in January before close up behind a well-treated rival (dead-heated since) one week later; not so good latest though so hard to call this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Four straight wins at the end of 2023; lay fallow last year but he's been back on song this winter and never relinquished his lead at Lingfield (5f; just as effective over C&D) 18 days ago; still well treated.

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden; no progress since handicapping but he's run only twice over 6f and was taking on an improved subsequent winner when runner-up at Chelmsford (first-time visor, retained) last month; likely contender off same mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins in 2023 but three successes in 2024 were over 7f and he was having his first run over 6f since last March when runner-up at Newcastle three weeks ago; that run could have sharpened him up; contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't run over 6f since winning at Doncaster as a 2yo but he doesn't lack for speed, racing freely in front over 7f here recently before overhauled inside the final furlong; bold show looks likely; refitted eyeshield/blinkers join the hood.

🔦 Spotlight: Losing run goes back to May 2022 but she ran her best race for a while when close up on the return to 6f at Southwell in January; not so effective there on Friday which gives her more to prove this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Tremendous sprinter who's won 11 times, four here; low key since returning from a break but he didn't look a completely lost cause at Chelmsford last month and the likely good pace here will suit; weighted to pounce and revival on the cards.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced; her early handicaps were over 1m but she wasn't caught out for pace dropped to 6f here in December before getting off the mark over 7f at Southwell last month; failed to find much on final start for Jack Jones but should still have some 6f potential; cheekpieces on.
