💬 Comment: Had excuses for two handicap defeats; sold 10,000gns since latest run in August
🔦 Spotlight: Well connected; had excuses for two handicap defeats for Richard Hannon as it was heavy at Windsor (1m) and 7f proved too sharp on Kempton AW in August; sold 10,000gns since and ✂️ gelded; might not have seen the best of him yet.

🔦 Spotlight: Won consecutive AW races in 2022 (over C&D) and 2023; out of sorts in 2024 but the first-time  tongue-tie seemed to help at Lingfield recently when he survived serious scrimmaging and racing wide on the home bend before leading close home; every chance back up 2lb.
