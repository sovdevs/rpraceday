🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over chase debut at Newcastle and could have more to offer over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to form and capitalised on a reduced mark on his chase debut in a four-runner handicap at Newcastle (2m, good to soft) last month; there can be optimism he'll be fine at this trip and he could have more to offer over fences, having done it in convincing fashion last time; key player.
