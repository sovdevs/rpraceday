💬 Comment: Runner-up at Goodwood in final two 2yo runs, with RPR of 83 last time; respected on return
🔦 Spotlight: £360,000 breeze-up buy; had excuses for failing to justify favouritism on Leicester debut (5f, good to soft) last May and he left that form behind when runner-up under prominent tactics at Goodwood (6f, good/good to firm) in his final two runs last season; recorded an RPR of 83 last time and he's strongly respected back in trip on his return.

💬 Comment: Big improvement dropped to 5f when a close second over C&D last month; hood now added
🔦 Spotlight: 220,000euros yearling; faded into sixth of 12 on Kempton debut (7f) in October but he found plenty of improvement dropped to 5f when front-running second here (85-40 favourite) last month; that was a narrow defeat behind a previous winner and he's a 🔥 big player on that form; hood added.

💬 Comment: Battled well when winning at Southwell and he's open to more progress back up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Made a promising debut when third over C&D in February and he took a major step forward when beating the favourite over 5f at Southwell (first two 6l clear) three weeks later; this is tougher under a penalty but he battled well last time and is open to more progress back at this track.

🔦 Spotlight: Mixed record in a variety of races for Emmet Mullins last season including a run in the Albany; 20-1 on stable debut over C&D (maiden) three weeks ago but she travelled well for long way and was only just caught on the line; that was her best effort so far and has claims if she can back that up.

💬 Comment: Ex-Irish; tailed off on recent stable debut at Southwell (7f) and others are preferred
🔦 Spotlight: 220,000euros yearling/breeze-up 2yo; promising third in one run (5f, Polytrack) for Joseph O'Brien in December but, after changing hands for 36,000gns, she failed to beat a rival on recent stable debut at Southwell (7f); that trip may have stretched her but this looks a tough assignment back at 5f; cheekpieces added.
