🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Up 5lb for Bellewstown win latest, Keane a good booking but heavy ground raises questions
🔦 Spotlight: 2-11 overall and 1-4 on turf; that turf win came last time out at Bellewstown (1m, good); 5lb rise for that fair but he's untried on ground this testing; booking of Keane is a plus but pedigree suggests conditions may not suit.

💬 Comment: Good run on h'cap debut latest, 1m should suit, untried on heavy, chance if handles it
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't show a lot in three maidens last year; much better on return at Cork on handicap debut off 73, beaten 3.75l into third (7f, good) and winner has gone in again since; 1m will suit on the evidence of that Cork run and yard is in form but heavy ground an unknown; chance if he handles it.

🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for yard; 0-6 as a 2yo but ran well in defeat; best effort a 0.5l second of 16 at the Curragh (7f, good) off 72 in September; not as good upped to 1m on soft off 6lb higher at Leopardstown next time and well beaten back there on return on good; may need better ground.

💬 Comment: Good run on yielding at Galway, potential 🚀 improver on handicap debut, check the market
🔦 Spotlight: Standout maiden effort came second time out over 7f on yielding at Galway in July; not as good at the Curragh (7f, good) when last seen in October; could improve on handicap debut and worth a 📊 market check.
