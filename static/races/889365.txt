🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only his fourth run over fences when doing it comfortably at Kempton; raised 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Admirably consistent gelding who didn't have too much trouble in justifying a shade of odds-on at Kempton 12 days ago (3m, good); 5lb rise is perfectly fair for one who was having only his fourth run over fences; should progress some more.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled at Ascot but in a strong race and previous efforts bring him right into this
🔦 Spotlight: Not at his best last time at Ascot but that was a competitive Class 1 handicap and his previous placed efforts included a near miss behind the subsequent Welsh National winner; commands respect at this level and he tries cheekpieces for the first time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has more on his plate than when winning at Ludlow but overall profile is appealing
🔦 Spotlight: Mostly consistent since sent over fences (4-11) but he has gone up 5lb for his 3m win at Ludlow (good to soft) when a lot went wrong for his five rivals; he was also partnered by a 3lb claimer then, so appears to have more on his plate now; still rates a likely contender given overall profile.

💬 Comment: Approaching his time of year and ran best race for a while when third at Kempton latest
🔦 Spotlight: Tends to come good around this time of year and ran his best race for a while when only 4l off The Doyen Chief at Kempton; bled from the nose there but that's rare for him and he should run very well.
