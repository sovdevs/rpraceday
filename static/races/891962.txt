🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner got off the mark at the second attempt over hurdles in a 19.5f maiden at this venue and that form has been boosted since by those in behind; reportedly coughing due to kickback after struggling in a Grade 1 here on latest; he has the best form, but the drop back to 2m does not look an obvious move.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flat winner, given break after Punchestown win, may have needed latest, outrun likely odds
🔦 Spotlight: Flat winner; promise first three starts over timber before landing a 3yo hurdle at Punchestown (2m, good); given a break afterwards, presumably to wait for spring ground; raced keenly early when well-beaten on return at Limerick (2m, yielding); this ground should suit better and he could improve for that run; may outrun likely odds.
