🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd run a big step forward from her debut; more to come & she's a key player; now hooded
🔦 Spotlight: She made a low-key debut at Newcastle in December (5f) but there was much more promise in her Southwell second (6f) four weeks ago, still looking inexperienced but keeping on well close home; bred to do better still and she's a leading contender now tried in a hood.

🔦 Spotlight: She made a low-key debut at Newcastle in December (5f) but there was much more promise in her Southwell second (6f) four weeks ago, still looking inexperienced but keeping on well close home; bred to do better still and she's a leading contender now tried in a hood.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd run a big step forward from her debut; more to come & she's a key player; now hooded
🔦 Spotlight: She made a low-key debut at Newcastle in December (5f) but there was much more promise in her Southwell second (6f) four weeks ago, still looking inexperienced but keeping on well close home; bred to do better still and she's a leading contender now tried in a hood.
