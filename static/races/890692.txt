🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready win at Lingfield (6f) last time; 5lb rise asks a stiffer question but he's improving
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the ninth attempt when coming from off the pace to win a 6f handicap at Lingfield nine days ago; did well there given he was caught wide and he should be fine back at 5f with so much potential pace on; he'll need to improve again to defy a 5lb rise but it's possible.

💬 Comment: Good second on stable/handicap debut this month; up 2lb and other pace to deal with
🔦 Spotlight: Showed speed in three runs in Ireland last summer but ran to just a modest level; improved on stable/handicap debut at Southwell two weeks ago (5f), making the running and headed only by the gambled-on winner; up 2lb and has other pace to contend with this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten in novice/maiden company but he offered more when third of 11 over 6f here on last month's handicap debut; drop to 5f could prompt further progress and he's of interest; withdrawn at Southwell this month having bolted before the start.
