🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual winner this term but well held off revised mark last month
🔦 Spotlight: Tried over a range of distances before winning 2m Wexford maiden in October (soft) and followed up in 2m4f Cork handicap on similar ground; didn't jump well when well held off this mark at Naas recently.
