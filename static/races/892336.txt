💬 Comment: Second to an 🚀 improver at Kempton and similar form next time at Stratford; solid
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who has been running well, finishing second to an 🚀 improver at Kempton (3m, good) before another sound effort at Stratford; solid claims.
Horse quote: 2024-11-18 at Leicester (22.5f): "The Wolf absolutely winged round for a circuit but we came round to the water jump and I thought I'd get a breather into him but he jammed the brakes on and I thought after that I'd probably be cooked. However, he showed a good attitude today, just winning probably helps those older horses and, obviously a veterans' chase last time he was able to get his head in front and he followed up today. He's a character but he's been a good servant for the yard - Sean Bowen, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran over hurdles last time; strong chance if back to the form he showed last summer
🔦 Spotlight: Would have every chance if rediscovering the form that saw him win two 3m handicaps at Perth last summer; below par in two runs since finishing fourth on Cheltenham's cross-country course in November but did run over hurdles last time; hard to dismiss.
Horse quote: 2024-06-09 at Perth (24f): "It's essential Statuario goes right-handed. We thought he was a two-and-a-half-miler but when he ran the other day all he did was stay. It was the same here, so hopefully we can go for the Summer Plate now; maybe he and Francky Du Berlais can line up together. That was a brilliant win. This had been the aim for a long time, so we're delighted - Michael Bowen, joint-trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2023-02-22 at Doncaster (19.5f): "Hurricane Bay has been running in some tough races and it's nice to find a softer one for him. We're thinking of the three-mile novice hurdle at Aintree for him, with a saver in the three-mile handicap there - Lucy Wadham, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed over this trip and ran well over C&D in January; effective when fresh
🔦 Spotlight: Having his first run beyond an extended 2m4f when the clear second behind a 📈 progressive winner over C&D in early January (good to soft; first-time visor); has won on good ground and the return of blinkers is not a negative; has also run well when fresh in the past.
Horse quote: 2023-05-01 at Warwick (16.5f): "Hystery Bere was good in his first year for us but we couldn't quite make him out in his second year. Tom (Symonds) said we should go chasing, and naturally I was nervous, but it worked out perfectly. Ben rode him beautifully from the front and he really likes his jumping - he's a gorgeous horse - Lady Gibbings, owner."
