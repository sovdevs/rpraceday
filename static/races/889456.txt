🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fell in Champion Hurdle; not at brilliant best in victory this term, but a leading player
🔦 Spotlight: Won this in 2023, didn't run in it last year; lost unbeaten hurdling record when falling mid-race in last month's Champion Hurdle and he made a bad mistake at the final flight when winning Cheltenham Grade 2 (2m1f, soft) in January; there's a worry he'll produce another major blunder and he hasn't matched his brilliant peak RPRs when winning twice this season, but he still beat Lossiemouth by just over 2l in the Grade 1 Christmas Hurdle at Kempton (2m, good) in December and is a leading player granted a clear round.
