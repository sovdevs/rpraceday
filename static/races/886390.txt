💬 Comment: Best when third of five in C&D novice, coming from last at 66-1; needs to build on that
🔦 Spotlight: Ran once for George Scott and twice for 🆕 new yard; best effort when third of five in C&D novice five weeks ago, coming from last at 66-1; needs to build on that but good chance for minor honours at the least.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sets the standard after three turf runs (6f) last August-October, runner-up in last two
🔦 Spotlight: Plenty of ability on turf in all three runs (6f) last August-October, runner-up at Yarmouth in last two; yard had a well-backed novice winner on Wednesday with a 4yo on first run since July, making his AW debut like this 3yo; the one to beat on form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11-2, overcame a slow start to launch a winning challenge in a restricted novice over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: 11-2, overcame a slow start to launch a winning challenge down the outside in a ten-runner restricted novice event over C&D on New Year's Eve; penalised and probably needs to improve but that was a promising debut.
