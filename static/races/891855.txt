🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed at Ascot and Newbury in her two 2yo runs; needs close look back in trip on return
🔦 Spotlight: Promising second on Ascot debut (6f, good) last July and was third of 13 in similar conditions at Newbury the following month; was beaten 6l last time but she travelled strongly for a long way and shaped as though this drop in trip could suit; needs close look on her return.
