🔦 Spotlight: Ran creditably in notable handicaps (1m/1m1f) towards the end of his 2024 campaign, Cambridgeshire runner-up the final time; appears to have a good prize in him; the booking of William Buick adds appeal; successful on reappearance in the last two seasons; very solid.
Horse quote: 2024-09-28 at Newmarket (9f): "You'd have to be delighted with that performance. James McHenry was beaten by a better-handicapped horse today and he was beaten fair and square. We can't be anything but proud of him - Ed Bethell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Scored at Meydan last time and remains well handicapped on best form; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Campaigned at Meydan this year and belatedly regained the winning thread last time; remains well handicapped on best form, such as his success off this mark at the York Ebor festival (1m) in 2023; shortlisted.
Horse quote: 2025-03-07 at Meydan (8f): "I'm absolutely delighted for Dylan, Caroline [Kelly, work rider] and the girls that are here looking after him. They've been very persistent and it's paid off. There were excuses last time [lost shoe] and I think he's a sensitive boy all around, but he had been running consistently. Ideally you want to be in the middle of them but this horse doesn't like to be bullied and they went quick enough early. I had to go a bit wide but he dug deep when I needed him to - Ray Dawson, jockey."

💬 Comment: Landed this prize on reappearance last year, beating Godwinson (2025 Lincoln winner)
🔦 Spotlight: Useful handicapper who registered sole success last season when beating Godwinson (2025 Lincoln winner) in this contest on reappearance; now 6lb higher but still warrants respect on seasonal debut.
Horse quote: 2024-04-20 at Newbury (8f): "I was quietly confident Metal Merchant would run a nice race but in these big handicaps you can be on the wrong side and all sorts, but that was a very smart performance. He was a decent 2yo and 3yo but it wasn't until we gelded him that he really flourished. He's going to be a nice horse to go for those big mile handicaps -  Jack Channon, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful handicapper who registered sole success last season when beating Godwinson (2025 Lincoln winner) in this contest on reappearance; now 6lb higher but still warrants respect on seasonal debut.

Horse quote: 2023-07-21 at Newbury (7f): "Cogitate is a beautiful looking horse, he has the size and scope and looks to have a big future ahead of him. He qualifies now for the Acomb and that could be a good step. We've won that a couple of times before with Dutch Connection and Phoenix Of Spain so that might be the route he takes."

Horse quote: 2022-08-26 at Newmarket (July) (7f): "Classic has travelled well every day but we let him roll today. He still has signs of immaturity there but he is a very talented horse. We just didn't want to have any excuses today. It wouldn't surprise me if we see him turn up at the top level, especially on soft ground. I'd say there is a fair chance we go to the Champagne at Doncaster next - Richard Hannon, trainer."

💬 Comment: Awarded the Spring Mile, following a stewards' inquiry; back on career-high mark
🔦 Spotlight: Awarded the Spring Mile at Doncaster two weeks ago, following a stewards' inquiry; started 50-1 for that prize, having seemed well exposed, and he's back on career-high mark now; this is harder.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Doncaster (8f): "I've only seen the side on and they both went for the same gap. The crucial part of it was that it was a short head. Did the interference cost Pearl Eye the race? The stewards deemed it did so that's why they've overturned it. He's done well regardless and I'd have taken second. He's run super from that low draw. He was a big price but I really liked him. He had a run the other day with cheekpieces on and that put him spot on, he's quite stuffy. He was unlucky at Chester last year and that's where he'll go next - Darryll Holland, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Record of 4-5 in 2023 but was 0-5 last year and he has something to prove back over 1m, having raced mainly at shorter (all wins over 6f); had gelding/wind operations since last run.
Horse quote: 2023-10-07 at Redcar (6f): "Clive has campaigned Dragon Leader beautifully, he's a sweet, likeable horse. He was getting a weight off a lot of them, which was a big help, and he's won some nice pots this year - Richard Kingscote, jockey."
