💬 Comment: Newmarket challenger who goes handicapping off a lowly mark in first-time cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Made debut in February and all three starts have been over 1m on AW; twice well beaten but in between she was a fair fifth of seven at Southwell; this Newmarket challenger goes handicapping off a lowly mark in first-time cheekpieces and there's potential in her pedigree; watch the betting.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Southwell (AW) in April on first attempt at 1m; best form has come on AW and she was only sixth of 12 over this C&D ten days ago (good to firm; half a length behind Wondrous Ways), but that latest performance still gives her an each-way shout in a race in which most have something to prove.

💬 Comment: Encouraging fourth on handicap debut (6f, AW) but well beaten here only ten days ago (6f)
🔦 Spotlight: Encouraging fourth on handicap debut at Southwell (6f, AW) in February and her pedigree provides some hope regarding this step up in trip; however, she was well beaten here (6f, good to firm) only ten days ago.

💬 Comment: Has shown little on her three starts but she's a possible 🚀 improver on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Made debut in March and has shown little on her three starts (7f/1m2f, AW) but this half-sister to Listed winner Cuban Tiger makes her first handicap start off a basement mark and it will be no surprise if she takes a sizeable step forward; the betting could be informative.

🔦 Spotlight: Mid-division in April in his first two handicaps (C&D last time, when just behind two of these); improvement needed today but perhaps the first-time cheekpieces will be a positive; not ruled out each-way.
