🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won readily over C&D on last month's stable debut and is a dual chase winner since
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Frence mare who scored readily by over 9l over C&D (good to soft) on last month's stable debut and also had plenty in hand when winning two subsequent chases (2m/2m2f), the latter by 21l off today's mark on Thursday; untested on ground faster than good to soft but still very difficult to oppose in her current mood.

🔦 Spotlight: Five hurdle wins (all in first half of 2023); no longer the force of old but put in good front-running shift when third of five at Plumpton (2m4f, soft) last month and will also be suited by today's trip-and-ground combination.
