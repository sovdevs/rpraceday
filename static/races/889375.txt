💬 Comment: Major improvement is needed on this handicap debut; marked step up in trip in weak race
🔦 Spotlight: Second in 2m4f maiden point in February 2023; four hurdle races (all on softer than good) this season, catching the eye of the stewards on penultimate start and finishing closer here latest; major improvement is still needed on this handicap debut but this is a marked step up in trip in weak race.
