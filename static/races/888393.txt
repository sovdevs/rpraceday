🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two C&D wins in January and unlucky not to add to his tally here last week; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins in January; close up in third on his last two starts, most recently over C&D last week; had all sorts of traffic issues against the far rail in the straight on that occasion and looked an unlucky loser; good draw this time and he's a 🔥 big player off the same mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Behind Buraback over C&D last week; this year's best gives him solid claims though
🔦 Spotlight: Well backed when winning a 5f handicap at Newcastle in January, his first run for Daragh Bourke; less good on his next two starts but he returned to form when second at Lingfield on his first run for this yard last month; strong favourite for a C&D handicap last week but could only manage seventh (Buraback an unlucky third); each-way shout.

💬 Comment: Conditions to suit and on a feasible mark; can go well despite his wide stall
🔦 Spotlight: Conditions to suit and when last of six at Newcastle on Friday he had his momentum checked at a crucial stage; not ideally drawn but likely to be dropped in so it's not insurmountable; one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back to his last winning mark but needs to leave last month's stable debut well behind
🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f wins for Jamie Osborne on Polytrack last season; well beaten in final two runs for that stable, and again on first run for Adrian Wintle three weeks ago; back to a winning mark but others look safer.
