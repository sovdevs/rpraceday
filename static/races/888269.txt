🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up in January but broke duck here latest (2m3f, soft); back up 3lb; can improve
🔦 Spotlight: Thought to be unsuited by soft ground, which was blamed for his pulled-up run two starts ago, so it was to his credit that he overcame those ground conditions to break his duck here (2m3f) 11 days ago; back up 3lb and it seems very likely he'll do better on good ground; cheekpieces added.

🔦 Spotlight: Good second to smart one in sole Irish point; definite promise over hurdles and fences in Britain, even though he faded at about 2m4f in two handicap chases (good to soft and heavy); travels strongly so the drop in trip may well suit; interesting on first run since wind surgery.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden hurdle winner; promising chase debut; below that level since but good ground suits
🔦 Spotlight: Won good-ground maiden hurdle last spring; encouraging chase debut when a persevering runner-up at Southwell (2m4f, good) in November and, although he's been a beaten favourite at about 2m twice since, he's still considered with the likely good ground in his favour.

💬 Comment: Convincing wins at 1m7f/2m this winter; below best of late, jumping repeatedly left latest
🔦 Spotlight: Useful type having been a wide-margin winner twice this winter, over 1m7f at Catterick (good) and Huntingdon (2m, soft); however, he stalled slightly at Uttoxeter in February and it was offputting to see him jump repeatedly left back at Huntingdon since; reservations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hurdle winner on good; has shown little on soft since his absence; could fare better today
🔦 Spotlight: Good-ground hurdle winner in April 2022 but not seen again until January and has shown little in three runs on soft, twice over fences; hard to weigh up but the likely good ground is probably just the ticket.
