🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D win last month was his third of the winter; excuses over 5f since; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Had a good winter, winning three times and runner-up on a further three occasions; beaten favourite off this mark the last twice but he ran into another sharp 🚀 improver on the former occasion and suffered a wide trip at Lingfield last time; could well resume winning ways back at 6f.

🔦 Spotlight: Two Wolverhampton wins this winter, coming from off the pace to lead in the final 100 yards last month (Wondrous Ways third); finished behind Frankies Dream over C&D before that though and another personal best is required.
