üî¶ Spotlight: Knocking on the door when runner-up four times in successive 7f-1m2f handicaps under David Dunsdon last year and heavy ground was perhaps a factor in his below-par final run; could have a role to play if resuming in good order.

üî¶ Spotlight: All his best runs have come on the AW and his latest placed effort, from the front at Southwell, was one of them (1m; just behind Al Suil Eile and Rising Force); this is only his second Flat run on turf and he could be a factor; the blinkers are working well.
