🔦 Spotlight: 0-10 over hurdles in Ireland but won Irish point by 6l last month (yielding ground); well handicapped on some of her old rules form and well worth a glance in the betting before this stable debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hexham winner last spring but not in same form on her three outings this year
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish veteran mare who came good for Nick Alexander at second attempt, under Natasha Cookson at Hexham (2m7f, soft) last spring; not in same form on any of three starts this year, though, and 1lb wrong today.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 over hurdles; seemingly aided by addition of tongue-tie when twice running respectably at start of this season (2m4f, good) but has fitness to prove after ten-month absence.
