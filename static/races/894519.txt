🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Gowran winner but he's up 7lb and with stamina to prove over this far
🔦 Spotlight: A long time between drinks but he stuck on well to win over 1m at Gowran a month ago; however, he's up 7lb and has stamina to prove over this far.
Horse quote: 2020-10-13 at Leicester (8f): "Top Of The Pops was really determined to win. He battled very well and was quite impressive on this heavy ground. He's a typical horse from Mark Johnston's stable - once he got his head in front he just kept fighting. He was very professional and the further he goes, the better he will be - Silvestre de Sousa, jockey."
