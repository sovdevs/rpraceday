🔦 Spotlight: 0-11 in bumpers/hurdles but came within a head of breaking her duck at Plumpton (2m, soft) last month, only just caught having attempted to make all; solid claims off the same mark if as effective on the likely quicker ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual 2m4f winner here; 5lb below last winning mark but a bit to find with Little Soiree
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins 2m4f (good) around here and 5lb lower than when successful at Taunton (2m, soft) early last year, but she finished 8l behind Little Soiree at Plumpton (2m, soft) last month; may be vulnerable to less-exposed rivals.
