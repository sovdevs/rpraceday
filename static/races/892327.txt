üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Showed a good attitude when winning over 2m at Dundalk 11 days ago with Makaiah in third
üî¶ Spotlight: Has improved gradually at Dundalk during the winter (placed twice over 1m4f in December) and was rewarded with victory in a 2m handicap 11 days ago; showed a good attitude and has a good chance of confirming form with third-placed Mafiah despite a 5lb rise; that run was prefaced by a decent hurdles run at Wexford.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Showed a good attitude when winning over 2m at Dundalk 11 days ago with Makaiah in third
üî¶ Spotlight: Has improved gradually at Dundalk during the winter (placed twice over 1m4f in December) and was rewarded with victory in a 2m handicap 11 days ago; showed a good attitude and has a good chance of confirming form with third-placed Mafiah despite a 5lb rise; that run was prefaced by a decent hurdles run at Wexford.
