🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive 3yo who made a promising return at Beverley two weeks ago; big run expected
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive 3yo, winning three times (5f to 6f); ran right up to his best at Beverley on his seasonal return (5f, good) two weeks ago, challenging in the final furlong but unable to repel the late thrust of a 📈 progressive sprinter; mark left unchanged and there could well be more to come this year; Tom Marquand 3-14 for the stable with a further five placed; big run expected.
Horse quote: 2024-09-08 at York (5f): "They went very quick - probably too fast - and Duran couldn't lay up with them early on, so we're chuffed to bits with that. That was one of the last real three-year-old-only races of the year we could go for, so we'll run him just once more for the year now - Nigel Tinkler, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this off 7lb higher last year; promising return at Newmarket; solid contender
🔦 Spotlight: 7lb lower than when winning the corresponding race 12 months ago (good to soft); came into last year's race off the back of a good run at the Craven meeting and it is the same this time round as he wasn't beaten far into fourth at Newmarket 13 days ago; more appealing than many.

💬 Comment: Best form on AW but travelled quite well at Newbury latest; drop to 5f could be a positive
🔦 Spotlight: All his best efforts have come on AW and he could only manage seventh of 11 at Newbury on his return to turf 19 days ago (6f, good); drop to 5f could spark extra though and he's on the same mark as when winning stylishly at Wolverhampton last month; Oisin Murphy retains the ride; chance.

💬 Comment: Not at best on his reappearance but on a dangerous mark and a well-run 5f could suit
🔦 Spotlight: Not seen to best effect on his return to action at Kempton two weeks ago (6f); a strongly-run 5f could suit this free-going sort and he's on a fair mark on his best efforts; still has low mileage.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three 6f AW wins in midwinter; drop back to 5f needs to spark a bit extra
🔦 Spotlight: His form has taken off since fitted with a tongue tie, winning three 6f AW handicaps around the turn of the year; ran to a similar level when third of four at Newcastle seven weeks ago; will need to pull out a bit more to defy this mark but he looks quick enough for the return to 5f.
Horse quote: 2025-01-11 at Chelmsford (AW) (6f): "To be honest, I thought Rebel Empire had a really good chance. I was doing eight-four, which is light for me, but he's the ultimate pro. He's turned himself around in the last month and I'm really pleased for him as he's all heart - Joe Leavy, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Multiple winner who shaped okay at Beverley two weeks ago; others may prove better treated
🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner down the years; stepped up on his reappearance effort (5f, AW) when finishing third at Beverley two weeks ago; might find some of his younger rivals better treated.
Horse quote: 2023-08-20 at Sandown (5f): "Good Earth ran at Goodwood on unraceable ground in the Stewards' Cup and they called the meeting off after that and Yarmouth was on the dead side and today was more on the ground that he likes. We know he jumps the stalls well, but we weren't expecting him to jump that well. We half expected to take a lead of Tom Marquand's horse (Get It) and sit maybe fifth or sixth and come with a run and see how far we have got. I've put him in the Ayr Gold Cup, but it depends on the ground and if it soft that would be a bit stiff. There is a race at York on Saturday but that might come too soon. The Portland would be a race for him and he only just missed getting in last year, but that would be a race for him - Michael Herrington, trainer."
