🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Exploited lower hurdle mark when 33-1 at Chepstow and a 5lb rise may not stop him
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins over fences last spring and he returned to form and exploited a lower hurdle mark when reverting to this sphere at Chepstow (2m7f, soft; 33-1) a fortnight ago; there's mileage in his mark even after a 5lb rise and he can play a leading role if backing up that latest effort.

🔦 Spotlight: Nine-race maiden whose best form has come on good ground and she failed to threaten at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft) in December following a long absence; however, she's 1lb lower than when going close for Simon Earle at Worcester in July 2023 and is one to watch in the betting on stable debut.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-14 over hurdles and out of form over fences prior to an early fall at Huntingdon this month; however, she's often run well here over hurdles and fences and perhaps the return to this course and first-time hood (replacing cheekpieces) will be the catalysts for a step back in the right direction.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has struggled under rules but the step up in trip could suit on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: He's struggled at triple-figure odds on his four rules starts (2m/2m1f); however, this 5yo now goes handicapping off a basement mark and could be suited by the step up in trip having finished third in a 3m point last April; interesting contender, especially if attracting market support.
