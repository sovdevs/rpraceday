💬 Comment: Fair at up to 1m on the Flat; better effort over jumps when fourth at Wetherby last time
🔦 Spotlight: Fair Flat performer at up to 1m for Jack Channon; pulled too hard on hurdles debut but better effort when fourth at Wetherby last time (2m, good; hampered by a loose horse two out); likely to improve.
