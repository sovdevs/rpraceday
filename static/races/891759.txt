🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Except for his Champion Chase blunder he's looked as brilliant as ever this season
🔦 Spotlight: Again forgot his lines at the Cheltenham Festival where he stayed on for a never-dangerous second in the Champion Chase after an almighty blunder at halfway; has been his brilliant self otherwise this season and was only doing enough when ridden out for  further top-level honours at Aintree (2m4f, good); has won the last two editions of this race and made it 5-5 at the track in the Tingle Creek on his last visit in December; Mark Walsh replaces the injured Nico De Boinville; hard to oppose.
Horse quote: 2025-04-04 at Aintree (20f): "You've got to admire two things there - Jonbon, who is amazing when he's doing that, and Nico [De Boinville, jockey]. He's been very brave, because it's been a tough little session, and to go out and ride him like that, that's a guy who had no fears. They went some clip - I don't know what the time was, but it must have been quick. Whether he's short or long [at his fences] - he's very clever when he dances, isn't he? To be able to do that - when he's long it's great, and when he's short, he's just very quick and in and out. It just went all wrong at Cheltenham, and it was proved today, he just loves doing that. That's what he does best. At Cheltenham the start went wrong, and he was on the back foot the whole way. He loves his own space. It was unfortunate, the tape went straight across his face and he went backwards. That was some gallop. Not many horses can jump that well that fast. We'll certainly think about going to Sandown again - Nicky Henderson, trainer.Jonbon was an absolute superstar today. He was incredibly brave and courageous when I needed him to be and he made the job easy. Credit to him, he's got us out of a tough period - Nico de Boinville, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Former main man in this division but his powers would appear to be on the wane
🔦 Spotlight: Former main man in this division and defied his advancing years with a defeat of subsequent Cheltenham Festival heroine Dinoblue on his return from a long absence at Cork in December; however, he was swatted aside by Jonbon next time at Ascot and then folded tamely in the Champion Chase; as on those two occasions, today's ground will be livelier than ideal.
Horse quote: 2025-01-18 at Ascot (17f): ""On that ground, Jonbon had too much speed for Energumene. The race didn't pan out to suit us. Paul [Townend, jockey] just said he got alongside Jonbon at the fourth last and he just picked up and went away from him. Jonbon is a nine-year-old and reaching his peak, whereas our fella is 11. We just need to pick our battles and have the right conditions, and that would mean very soft ground. If the ground came up heavy at Cheltenham like it did last year, you'd maybe have a pop - Sean Graham, owner's racing manager."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Absent for nearly a year but trained by a genius and he's proven at this level
🔦 Spotlight: Top-class novice chaser from 2m to 2m4f, winning his third Grade 1 over fences (also won at that level hurdling) when flooring the Arkle winner Gaelic Warrior on yielding ground at Punchestown last May; this is a huge ask after almost 12 months off but he is trained by a genius; he could give Jonbon something to think about.
Horse quote: 2024-05-02 at Punchestown (16.5f): "Il Etait Temps is an extraordinary horse, that's his third Grade 1 this year.  He doesn't look like a big steeplechaser but he's got an engine and he jumps well. He's just maturing and learning all the time - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jonbon has his number and he disappointed last time in the Game Spirit at Newbury
🔦 Spotlight: Grand servent to his connections but an 11yo now and was no match for Jonbon in this 12 months ago, which isn't the only time the Henderson horse has had his number; disappointed last time in the Game Spirit won by Master Chewy.
Horse quote: 2024-11-15 at Cheltenham (16f): "Edwardstone ran very well. As he's getting older it's a little harder getting the weight off of him but I think he's run a grand race. We left a bit of work on, no doubt Nicky [Henderson] is the same [with Jonbon] but we'll take him on again in the Tingle Creek. It's probably pointless as it's 4-0 to Jonbon but there's a lot of money at stake. I think we'll stick at two miles. I'm very satisfied - Alan King, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A good bet to give his running but he's relying on some of these being off their game
🔦 Spotlight: Smart novice last season, running well when falling in the Arkle and then nearly winning the equivalent at Aintree (good to soft); at least matched that form in winning the Grade 2 Game Spirit at Newbury in February and his Ryanair defeat can be attributed to the 2m4f; a good bet to give his running but he's relying on some of these being off their game.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Newbury (16.5f): "Master Chewy was always going to run on and he probably needs further, so perhaps we'll go for the Ryanair - Nigel Twiston-Davies, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jonbon comfortably has his measure on their previous clashes; lots to find on the figures
🔦 Spotlight: Won last season's Grand Annual at the Cheltenham Festival and put up a sterling defence when runner-up last month; however, Jonbon comfortably has his measure on their previous clashes; lots to find on the figures.
Horse quote: 2024-03-13 at Cheltenham (16f): "Unexpected Party had a great start to the year, but in the winter he was nowhere - he was finishing last in four-runner novice chases, admittedly good races, but finishing last and never looking like beating a horse. But the handicapper reassessed him from the Paddy Power days back to the mark he started off this year, and that was probably a big help to him. He was very brave over the last two fences - two big jumps over them. I would say I was surprised Harry got both big jumps, but fair play to the horse, he needed both of them - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Highly talented but a quirky customer and even if on his best behaviour this looks far too tough a task for one who is essentially a quality handicapper.
Horse quote: 2024-12-27 at Wetherby (15f): "It was a genius ride and a brilliant job by Dan [Skelton, trainer] and the team because Harper's Brook is good at throwing races. They've worked him out - although even then Kielan thought he'd got upsides too quickly. He has masses of ability but he's just odd. When he thinks he's done it, he stops - Andrew Megson, owner."
