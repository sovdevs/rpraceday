💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 4yo who won over C&D two weeks ago and is open to more progress; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who returned after a gelding operation with a fast-ground win over C&D (6-5 favourite) two weeks ago; this is tougher off 4lb higher but he showed a good attitude for that convincing success and is open to more progress; 🔥 big player.

💬 Comment: Comfortable win at Chelmsford and he looks worth a try at this new trip; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Went close at Chelmsford (1m2f, AW) and Bath (1m2f, good to firm) last month before a comfortable success back at Chelmsford (first-time visor) last time; 3lb higher at this new trip but he was strong at the finish last time and he still has scope for further progress; interesting contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Salisbury on Thursday and he's respected under a penalty on this drop back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who recorded his second Flat win when scoring under a positive ride at Salisbury (1m6f, good to firm) on Thursday; has a penalty in this deeper race but he was as good as ever last time and this drop back in trip should be fine; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-05-15 at Salisbury (14f): "Macari is still quick enough for a mile and a half but he's always going to stay as a two-and-a-half-mile hurdler. He can go with whatever is available. If there's nothing over jumps he can do it on the Flat. He's versatile and not ground dependent. It makes such a difference having a horse who can do what you want him to - Sheena West, trainer."

💬 Comment: Ended long losing run when scoring after wind surgery at Lingfield; respected back on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Ended a three-year losing spell when scoring off a reduced mark at Lingfield (1m4f, AW) last month, on his first run after wind surgery; back up 4lb in the weights but that was a smooth success and he could be a big factor again back on turf.
Horse quote: 2025-04-28 at Lingfield (AW) (12f): "They bought Educator as a three-year-old off William Haggas. He ran well for Mick Appleby, but he was running over a mile-six and two miles, and I always thought he seemed to have a bit more speed - Brendan Powell, assistant trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Generally reliable type who is on a workable mark and is effective at 1m4f; possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: All four wins have been at shorter trips but he has form at 1m4f and is generally reliable; wasn't beaten far here on his reappearance three weeks ago and he's now only 1lb higher than for his Newbury win (1m2f, good to firm) last summer; dangerous back up in trip.
Horse quote: 2023-05-01 at Windsor (10f): "Fast Steps was an expensive horse as a yearling and we bought him out of Richard Hannon's yard where he'd been a pacemaker. He was a bit sour and my son Patrick rides him well. We've got to keep his brain in gear, but he has got ability and the ground wasn't that important - he'd go on better ground - Rod Millman, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won here (1m2f, good to soft) last April and was also successful at Newmarket (1m1f, soft) in the autumn; only 1lb higher than for that last success and he reappeared with a creditable fourth back at this track last month; should benefit from that run and he has won over 1m4f on fast ground in the past; in the mix.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Record of 1-12 and made low-key start for 🆕 new yard here last month; others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: Won soft-ground maiden in France for David Menuisier last August and placed in Doncaster handicap (1m4f, good to soft) the following month; had tough assignments in Listed events in next two starts but she returned to calmer waters with ninth of ten on stable debut here (1m2f, good to firm) last month; may have needed that run but she's now 1-12 and others are more convincing.

💬 Comment: On reduced mark but she needs to raise her game at this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won three of her first five starts but last success was in June 2023 and she's finished down the field in her last five runs; mark continues to fall but she needs to raise her game at this new trip.
Horse quote: 2023-01-13 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Dayzee has always showed us plenty at home. Jack just let her get into a rhythm and he said she was still a bit green. She will go a bit further - Mark Fahey, trainer."
