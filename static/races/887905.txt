💬 Comment: Ground possibly quick enough at Down Royal; more likely back on soft
🔦 Spotlight: Touched off in 2m Tipperary maiden in November (soft) and didn't run badly on latest of two handicap efforts since despite not looking that happy on better ground; return to soft ground ans step up in trip should suit so definite contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced 8yo; won 2m5f Limerick handicap in late 2022 (heavy) and touched off at Cork a year later on return; two December comeback runs after further absence leave him with plenty to find.
