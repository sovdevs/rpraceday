🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner; yet to build on promising hurdle debut but this is weak; upped in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner at Taunton last spring; had wind surgery prior to finishing second on her hurdle debut/reappearance at Wincanton on Boxing Day (1m7f, good to soft); beaten at short odds at Taunton the following month and again a beaten favourite at Kempton when last seen five weeks ago; steps up in trip today and she's been found a golden opportunity.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point/useful bumper winner; things yet to go to plan over hurdles but still early days
🔦 Spotlight: Point/useful bumper winner; made mistakes when third of nine on her hurdle debut at Southwell in October, after which she underwent wind surgery (her second such operation); 11-4 second favourite for a 2m3f mares' maiden at Wetherby on Boxing Day but dropped right away and was subsequently found to have bled from the nose; has ability and this is weak so she has to be considered despite the obvious risks; hood now enlisted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dam a maiden from a good jumping family; betting to guide on racecourse debut
🔦 Spotlight: Dam placed over hurdles, half-sister to smart 2m2f-2m6f hurdle/chase winner Easter Legend and smart 2m1f-2m3f chase winner Easter Meteor; starts out in an uncompetitive maiden and she's worth a look in the market.

💬 Comment: Dropped away in the straight in an Exeter bumper (2m, heavy); can do better in time
🔦 Spotlight: Had wind surgery prior to her debut in an Exeter bumper last month (2m, heavy), a race where she dropped away in the straight; was nibbled in the betting there and bred to have a future over obstacles but still not easily recommended.
