🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In fine form since hood went on (1221); every chance of going in again under her penalty
🔦 Spotlight: In fine form since the hood went on (1221) and put up a remarkable performance to win over 7f here last Saturday, tailed off early but coming through to win cosily in the end; no problem with the return to 1m and with the race likely to be run to suit, she has every chance of following up under her penalty.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner over 7f, but  still to truly convince over this far
🔦 Spotlight: Can front-run; easily won a weak affair here (7f) in January and just beaten at Southwell (7f, Tapeta) next time, but held over 1m back there last month; still to truly convince over this far.
