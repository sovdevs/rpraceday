🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 since winning the prestigious Coral Gold Cup at Newbury in November 2022 and he's not the same force nowadays, but he took a step back in the right direction in reapplied cheekpieces (retained) when third at Chepstow (2m3f, soft) in December; another 2lb lower and one to consider.

💬 Comment: Race-fitness is a query but major player if reproducing Cheltenham Festival-winning form
🔦 Spotlight: Early faller on reappearance at Cheltenham in December so he hasn't had a full race under his belt this season; however, he won the Plate at last season's Cheltenham Festival (2m4f, soft) and today's 4lb higher mark is unlikely to stop him if he can reproduce that form.

💬 Comment: Encouraging third at Market Rasen on second start back from absence; could build on it
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-16 over fences and no match for the first two when third at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) three weeks ago, but that was still an encouraging run (faded late on) on his second start back from a long absence and he could build on it; also effective on soft going and well treated on his old form.

💬 Comment: 10l win at Carlisle then pulled up at Market Rasen; player if bouncing back in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Reappeared with 10l win at Carlisle (2m5f, soft) in December; reportedly never travelling when pulled up at Market Rasen three weeks ago and it's hard to be overly confident following that, but the first-time cheekpieces could give him a boost and he's a major player on the Carlisle form.

🏠 Owner: The Preston Family, Friends & T Jacobs
💬 Comment: A long time since he's run well but this front-runner has dropped to a very dangerous mark
🔦 Spotlight: All of his best form is over about 2m and he's unproven at this trip, and he's struggled on all seven starts since winning in December 2023; however, he's been inconvenienced the last twice by being pestered for the lead, and has dropped to a very dangerous mark; no surprise to see a bold bid.

💬 Comment: Pulled up on December comeback but tailed off on return last season before winning next 2
🔦 Spotlight: Struggled on final two runs last season and same story on return in December (reportedly lost his action); however, tailed off on last season's reappearance before winning his next two starts (2m5f/2m3f, heavy/soft), so there can be some optimism that he'll leave that latest run well behind.

💬 Comment: Step back in right direction when third at Chepstow last time and he's one to consider
🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 since winning the prestigious Coral Gold Cup at Newbury in November 2022 and he's not the same force nowadays, but he took a step back in the right direction in reapplied cheekpieces (retained) when third at Chepstow (2m3f, soft) in December; another 2lb lower and one to consider.

💬 Comment: Race-fitness is a query but major player if reproducing Cheltenham Festival-winning form
🔦 Spotlight: Early faller on reappearance at Cheltenham in December so he hasn't had a full race under his belt this season; however, he won the Plate at last season's Cheltenham Festival (2m4f, soft) and today's 4lb higher mark is unlikely to stop him if he can reproduce that form.

🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-16 over fences and no match for the first two when third at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) three weeks ago, but that was still an encouraging run (faded late on) on his second start back from a long absence and he could build on it; also effective on soft going and well treated on his old form.

🔦 Spotlight: Reappeared with 10l win at Carlisle (2m5f, soft) in December; reportedly never travelling when pulled up at Market Rasen three weeks ago and it's hard to be overly confident following that, but the first-time cheekpieces could give him a boost and he's a major player on the Carlisle form.

🔦 Spotlight: All of his best form is over about 2m and he's unproven at this trip, and he's struggled on all seven starts since winning in December 2023; however, he's been inconvenienced the last twice by being pestered for the lead, and has dropped to a very dangerous mark; no surprise to see a bold bid.

💬 Comment: Pulled up on December comeback but tailed off on return last season before winning next 2
🔦 Spotlight: Struggled on final two runs last season and same story on return in December (reportedly lost his action); however, tailed off on last season's reappearance before winning his next two starts (2m5f/2m3f, heavy/soft), so there can be some optimism that he'll leave that latest run well behind.

💬 Comment: Encouraging third at Market Rasen on second start back from absence; could build on it
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-16 over fences and no match for the first two when third at Market Rasen (3m, good to soft) three weeks ago, but that was still an encouraging run (faded late on) on his second start back from a long absence and he could build on it; also effective on soft going and well treated on his old form.
