💬 Comment: Back in form with placed efforts the last twice; in the mix, provided he stays new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins at 2m4f last term; back in form with placed efforts (2m4f/2m1f) the last twice; in the mix, provided he stays this new trip.
Horse quote: 2024-01-02 at Ayr (20.5f): "I'm just absolutely over the moon, I can't explain the feeling. I'm not quite Frankie [Dettori] yet but I'll keep trying! I'd say Follow Charlie was runner-up last time to quite a well-treated winner, who then won again to boost the form, so it filled us with a little bit of confidence coming here. I thought stepping up in trip was always going to suit him. He's a real pleasure to ride, he travels and jumps fantastically - jockey Ben Smith, speaking on  Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2023-12-20 at Ayr (18f): "I didn't really want to run Beat The Retreat on today's ground but the owner was keen. We could have waited until new year but it might have been even softer so we thought we'd take our chance, and it paid off - Nick Alexander, trainer."

He's not a winter horse, he's not very big and he's such a good mover. He'll probably get further - Sean Quinlan, jockey"
