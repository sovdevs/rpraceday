🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two impressive wins before Grade 2 flop at Kempton; leading contender back down in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Won maiden hurdle at Windsor (2m, good to soft) in December on stable debut and easily followed up at Hereford (2m, soft); tailed off in Grade 2 at Kempton (2m, good to soft) since but he's a leading contender if bouncing back to his best now back down in grade.
