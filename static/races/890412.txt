Horse quote: 2022-07-30 at Thirsk (8f): "On The River won on this day last year. He's consistent. I was a bit worried about the ground over this trip but he toughed it out. He's got a good attitude - Ben Haslam, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not straightforward, often slowly away before taking a keen hold, but is a C&D winner
🔦 Spotlight: Not straightforward, often slowly away before taking a keen hold; however, three handicap wins (Class 6) under Elle-May Croot last season including one over C&D; too headstrong at Southwell latest but has been competitive in this class; possible player as long as the ground doesn't turn slow.
Horse quote: 2024-08-11 at Ripon (8f): "The race was run to suit. We thought they were going to go very quick and I said to Ellie 'whatever you do, don't panic.' She gave Bowood a perfect ride. The change of scenery has probably done the trick with him, he's a very happy horse at the moment. He's progressing and I hope he can still do a bit more. I think he'll stay a mile and a quarter in time - Ivan Furtado, trainer."

💬 Comment: 6-23 record at Ripon including two C&D Class 5 handicap wins last term; off 210 days
🔦 Spotlight: 6-23 record at Ripon including two C&D Class 5 handicap wins last term, but this might be a bit beyond the 10yo under an inexperienced apprentice on his first start since September; versatile ground-wise.
Horse quote: 2024-07-08 at Ripon (8f): "Garden Oasis was quickly away and I needed that as I knew there was going to be more pace in the race and, obviously drawn one, I could hold the rail if I was quick out so it was ideal, but I did have to go a little bit quicker than I wanted to into the bend. I got a bit of a breather round it but he does stay a bit further so you can stretch them and make sure they don't come past you at any speed. He's as game as they come and loves it around here - David Allan, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Often slowly away and takes a keen hold; has never won above Class 5 and last seven wins gained on AW, including two starts back; however, first two wins were gained on turf; has form on fast and soft ground.
Horse quote: 2025-01-30 at Southwell (AW) (7f): "When I won on Overnight Oats at Wolverhampton I thought he had a few more races in him but he was limited in what he could run in. We had to step him up to 1m2f which didn't suit and then back down to 7f where he ran a bit flat. This is a more testing 7f than Lingfield and he was back to his best - Hector Crouch, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-08-02 at Goodwood (8f): "I'm a bit frustrated. I thought Dutch Decoy was the best chance we had in the race. Obviously the winner has come from stall 21, but you need the rub of the green from there and from two and a half to the furlong marker we were all dressed up with nowhere to go. I actually thought my two in front were setting it up perfectly for him because they went a strong gallop. We'll just have to make sure we're back here next year - Charlie Johnston, trainer."
