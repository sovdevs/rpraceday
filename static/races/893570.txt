🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m form gives him major claims, slight stamina doubt after latest but the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner in France (including Group 3 bumper) and some solid runs in maiden hurdles for current yard, notably Limerick second and when chasing home a 10l odds-on winner at Punchestown; forcing tactics employed latest but didn't get home over 2m4f when beaten 20l into fourth; slightly lesser stamina test here could suit and 🔥 big player in what appears a weaker maiden.

💬 Comment: French recruit showed promise over fences at Wexford; back hurdling and can't rule out
🔦 Spotlight: French recruit second in 2m6f handicap chase at Auteuil in October and made much of running (keen, not helped by loose horse) on Irish debut when fourth in 2m4f Wexford novice handicap chase early this month under amateur rider; back hurdling here, goes on soft and can't rule out.

💬 Comment: Decent form on good ground early in the season; back from winter break, ground a concern
🔦 Spotlight: Modest enough form in points but justified market support on rules debut to win Bellewstown bumper last summer (good); solid start over hurdles on similar ground at Gowran in October, looking in need of 2m+; interesting on return but won't want too much rain.
