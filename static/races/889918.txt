🔦 Spotlight: Hat-trick seeker having just his seventh start over timber and fourth run in a handicap; both wins here, staying on really well to get the better of Gabbys Cross a fortnight ago, suggesting this step back up in trip may be fine; 10lb rise is justified and ought to go well again.

🔦 Spotlight: Getting better with each run and chased home two nice prospects in a maiden hurdle at Punchestown last month (including Kainsbourg who runs in the maiden hurdle on this card); pedigree suggests he could be an 🚀 improver stepping up in trip and his opening mark looks workable.

💬 Comment: Gr 2 novice hurdle winner in pomp; 3rd in h'cap chase when last seen; might need this
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2 novice hurdle winner in his pomp and showed he's just as effective over fences with two wins early this season; last seen finishing third in a handicap chase at the Galway Festival; testing ground would be fine but has a modest record fresh so might be best watched after 217 days off.
