💬 Comment: Won 3 of his last 4, the wins at 5f & the defeat a close 2nd over C&D; new mark still fair
🔦 Spotlight: He's not looked back since switched to AW handicaps/tried in a hood and he comes here having won three of his last four starts; those wins have been at 5f, and the one defeat came when second over C&D in early January (having won the day before); doubt a 4lb rise is beyond him but may be happier at 5f.

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't raced over 6f since the 2023 Ayr Bronze Cup; some solid 5f form this winter and, while the trip is a slight query (0-16), he was placed in a 0-85 in July 2022; today's rider knows him and is good value for his claim, especially in an apprentice race; could go well.

💬 Comment: Won 3 of his last 4, the wins at 5f & the defeat a close 2nd over C&D; new mark still fair
🔦 Spotlight: He's not looked back since switched to AW handicaps/tried in a hood and he comes here having won three of his last four starts; those wins have been at 5f, and the one defeat came when second over C&D in early January (having won the day before); doubt a 4lb rise is beyond him but may be happier at 5f.

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't raced over 6f since the 2023 Ayr Bronze Cup; some solid 5f form this winter and, while the trip is a slight query (0-16), he was placed in a 0-85 in July 2022; today's rider knows him and is good value for his claim, especially in an apprentice race; could go well.
