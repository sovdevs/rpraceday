🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well over 1m7f last time; much longer trip today but reasons to be optimistic
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in two maiden hurdles (2m3f/2m5f, good) last spring and back to form when going close under Rob Hargreaves at Leicester (1m7f, heavy) on his second handicap start; takes sizeable step up in trip today but he stayed on well over 2m5f last May and there's stamina in his pedigree; chance.

🔦 Spotlight: Out of form this season and has plenty to prove, but he posted two easy wins over C&D (soft) early last year, including in this race, and he's dropped below his last winning mark; cheekpieces (worn for last four wins but absent on last three starts) return; not written off now back here.
