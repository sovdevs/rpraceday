🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two hurdle wins; creditable 3rd on latest chase run in October and this is a lower grade
🔦 Spotlight: Two hurdle wins at up to 2m2f, including on good to firm; just fair hurdle runs on last two starts but he'd run creditably on his second completed chase, at Uttoxeter (2m, good) in October, when third to two who are on much higher marks now; of interest down in grade and back from break.
Horse quote: 2023-10-12 at Exeter (18.5f): "Jeudidee loves top of the ground and probably ran a better race when third at Uttoxeter last week than he did today, as that was very competitive on softer ground than he wanted. He's a nice horse at this time of year and loves his jumping. Providing he's all right in the next ten days, we'll definitely see him again soon. He wants good ground and places like Wincanton will suit him. It was his first time right-handed today and you could see he'll learn from that, but he has a nice future - Kim Bailey, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two hurdle wins; creditable 3rd on latest chase run in October and this is a lower grade
🔦 Spotlight: Two hurdle wins at up to 2m2f, including on good to firm; just fair hurdle runs on last two starts but he'd run creditably on his second completed chase, at Uttoxeter (2m, good) in October, when third to two who are on much higher marks now; of interest down in grade and back from break.

💬 Comment: In modest form over fences/hurdles in 2024; 9lb wrong back from a layoff
🔦 Spotlight: In modest form over fences and hurdles last year and has a lot to prove after a layoff, from 9lb out of the weights.
Horse quote: 2021-04-05 at Plumpton (18f): "I think Mawlood was unlucky his last few runs and Phil told be he had an each-way chance. We got a good posi and then it's just about keeping him going forward as he's not the quickest. With a circuit to go I was half off the bridle and yet I've ended up taking it up sooner than I'd have liked but I didn't want to disappoint him. I was surprised how well I was going turning in and he galloped all the way to the line - Shane Quinlan, rider."
