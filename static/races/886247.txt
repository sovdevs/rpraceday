🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reverts to hurdling after disappointing chase run and a wind op; on a good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Placed on three of his ten hurdling starts for Dan Skelton and ran well on chase/stable debut in October; well below that form on next outing and now reverts to hurdling after another wind op (his third); not easy to predict and would appeal more on good ground, but he's on a good mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful at his best on the Flat; made quiet start to hurdling career but remains 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Useful on the Flat at his best; safely held on first two hurdling starts (2m3f/2m1f) and was tailed off when unseating rider on latest outing but makes his handicap hurdle debut in a low-grade race and may yet transfer some of that Flat ability to this code.
