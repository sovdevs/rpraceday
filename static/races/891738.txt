💬 Comment: Point winner and 3-3 in bumpers; won well at Ffos Las a week ago and is respected
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who was 3-3 in Stratford bumpers (good/good to firm) last summer; lost his rider (not always his fault) in his first two starts over hurdles, but made no mistake on his return from six months off at Ffos Las (2m, good to soft) a week ago; further improvement needed, but that is possible.

💬 Comment: Things not gone to plan since winning well at Warwick, but major chance if bouncing back
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 in bumpers albeit Listed-placed; looked a nice hurdling prospect when winning in fine style at Warwick (2m5f, good to soft) in December, but things haven't gone to plan in either start since with his jumping proving an issue; major chance if reverting to the Warwick form.
