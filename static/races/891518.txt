💬 Comment: Steadily 📈 progressive in the main last year; may still have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent and steadily 📈 progressive last year until below par in cheekpieces final outing; headgear now removed; may still have more to offer.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Doncaster (12f): "I thought why not have a go, it's worth £40,000 and these races are very hard to win in the spring time and trying to win one now is probably a little bit easier. And they're very important for all owners and trainers. The track at Carlisle didn't suit Cabrera last time. If we'd had something to aim at a bit longer here she might have been a bit more impressive - Ed Bethell, trainer."
