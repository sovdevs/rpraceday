🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two runs as a 2yo, scoring at Ripon (6f, soft) on second occasion; 🔍 unexposed & interesting
🔦 Spotlight: She made a promising debut at Newbury last September and duly improved to win a Ripon maiden (6f, soft) eight days later; challenged widest and didn't look in love with the track on that occasion so the run should probably be upgraded a touch; moves into handicaps with potential.
Horse quote: 2024-09-28 at Ripon (6f): "I liked Medinilla the first time and she's come on a tremendous amount at home. If she handled the track I was fairly confident she'd run well. If you hit one ridge here, you hit all of them. We didn't get into the flow until the last furlong, so you can only be pleased. They've done well to nurture her to this point as next year is when she'll flourish - Jack Channon, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Effective over C&D and made a fair return to action last month; not obviously well treated
🔦 Spotlight: Placed twice as a 2yo, including C&D, and she made a satisfactory seasonal return when sixth at Windsor three weeks ago; drawn wide here though and may need some more weight off her back.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner; not fired in two runs this year but she's becoming well treated
🔦 Spotlight: C&D win as a 2yo; has plenty of handicapping potential on last year's best but she has been disappointing in two runs this year; others look safer despite the reduced mark.
Horse quote: 2023-10-09 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "Everything went smoothly. Tiger Tulip was away nicely and we just took a tow into the race off the favourite. She's still very inexperienced so I thought I'd squeeze her in between two (rivals) in the home straight and she picked up nicely - Cieren Fallon, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
