🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy performer; won well on his stable debut at Lingfield in December; high on the list
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 1 placed in October 2023; failed to win during a spell in Australia but showed no ill effects from his travels when comfortably seeing off a solid AW performer, who has won since, in a Listed event at Lingfield on New Year's Eve (stable debut); this will be the longest trip he's tackled so far but he's bred to stay 1m4f and he's the pick of the weights.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved with each start in 2024; still 🔍 unexposed; ✂️ gelded; tried in headgear; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Improved his RPR with each of his four runs last year, impressive at Kempton when last seen in November (1m4f; Listed; AW debut); stayed on strongly on that occasion and interesting that connections have since ✂️ gelded him, and are adding cheekpieces for the first time; surely has more to offer in 2025 and the Gosden stable has won four of the last six runnings.
