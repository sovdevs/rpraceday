🔦 Spotlight: Got up inside the last 110yds when winning for the first time at Southwell (2m) three weeks ago; that was just his second go over a staying trip and he may still have untapped potential; has to prove his effectiveness on turf (well beaten on debut only start) but otherwise has plenty in favour.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has gone the wrong way in four starts; cheekpieces and big step up in distance here
🔦 Spotlight: 360,000euros yearling who was picked up for 5,000gns as a 3yo, having twice struggled for Joseph O'Brien; tailed off both starts (1m4f/1m) for new connections so requires a leap of faith here, although it's possible cheekpieces and a big step up in distance will have a positive effect.
