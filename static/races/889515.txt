💬 Comment: Bounced back with a strong-finishing win here (1m4f) last Saturday and he's a key player
🔦 Spotlight: Just two wins from 33 starts but latest was a strong-finishing success over 1m4f here last Saturday; that was by a neck but he's only 2lb higher here and is a 🔥 big player if he can repeat the form back up in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Emphatic win at Newcastle (2m) last month but was disappointing back there last time
🔦 Spotlight: Hit a personal best with his dominant display at Newcastle (2m, Tapeta) last month but he was last of six on his return visit 12 days ago; still looks feasibly treated on his penultimate form but he's hard to predict and needs to bounce back again after that last run; cheekpieces are removed and visor returns.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hurdle and Flat winner who was placed over C&D last time; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Won over hurdles (2m4f) for Fergal O'Brien last September and made a winning debut for this yard at Wolverhampton (9.4f, Tapeta) in January; hasn't really gone on from that since but her latest third at Southwell (1m6f) was a respectable effort and she's still 🔍 unexposed on the Flat; not ruled out.
