🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning favourite at Wexford on third chase start, could slot into handicaps effectively
🔦 Spotlight: Point/maiden hurdle winner; creditable fifth behind Golden Ace in the Mares' Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham last season; solid run behind the useful Spindleberry on chase debut at Cork in December, a late mistake proving costly, and that form was boosted here on Sunday; jumped poorly at Naas; winning favourite at Wexford on third start, could slot into handicaps effectively.
Horse quote: 2024-02-21 at Punchestown (20f): "Majestic Force was getting plenty of weight from the second but that was very good for a first run over hurdles. Rachael thinks she will be better in a better race where they go a stride quicker - Robbie Power, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 1 juvenile hurdle winner, beginning to get to grips with chasing judged on C&D win
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 1-winning juvenile hurdler; ran creditably in a pair of big handicap hurdles last spring; failed to show anything like that sort of form on first three attempts chasing; beginning to get to grips with this discipline judged on C&D win in February, achieved at the expense of three stablemates, including favourite and subsequent winner Paggane.
Horse quote: 2023-04-13 at Aintree (17f): "Zenta was travelling great and winged the last and I landed in front, so I sent her on. I couldn't really peg her back, but I know in future to hold on to her. She's still very green and still learning in front of a big crowd today, so I know a bit more about her now - Mark Walsh, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Suffered interference at Leopardstown in December, good run at this venue early that month
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winner over hurdles; 0-6 over fences; fair third behind La Malmason in a 2m4f mares' handicap here in December; suffered interference from a faller at Leopardstown later that month; best with some ease in the ground; could feature.
Horse quote: 2023-09-15 at Ballinrobe (22f): "Ballybawn Belter has been amazing. She was narrow and skinny when Frank (Berry) bought her but she's done well physically. She seems to stay reasonably well but physically she's done very well in the last six to eight months as she wasn't imposing last year. I was contemplating going over fences with her as she jumps a fence really well, but Frank twisted my arm to stay over hurdles. She's a pleasure to train. I'm looking forward to running her over fences - Liz Doyle, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4-9 over fences, third in Cheltenham G2, seventh in the Irish Grand National yesterday
🔦 Spotlight: Started well over fences, winning four smallish-field races (at up to 2m4f) between late September and November (on ground ranging from soft to good); struggled in the Drinmore at this venue before finishing 9l third behind Bioluminescence at Limerick; creditable third behind Dinoblue in the Mares' Chase at Cheltenham; beaten over 28 lengths when seventh in the Irish Grand National yesterday.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Shecouldbeanything ran a great race again and I'm very happy. She does fall slightly short of those top mares, but she has loads of experience now. I thought she ran above herself and we will probably go to the Irish Grand National now - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

💬 Comment: Two handicap chase wins were gained in quick succession last June, going may not be ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Notched up back-to-back handicap chase wins at Kilbeggan and Punchestown last June; pleasing return to action in a Grade 3 mares' hurdle at Punchestown in February; possible excuses when unplaced at Navan last time; four of her six wins have been on good, this going may not be ideal.
Horse quote: 2024-06-09 at Punchestown (20.5f): "Mousey Brown enjoyed the little bit ease in the ground and she really galloped to the line. She's a hardy mare. The plan is to go to the Midlands National at Kilbeggan. She's a big mare and she seems to be going the right away - Dermot McLoughlin, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Took a sharp rise in the ratings for a 2m4f win at this venue in December (Ballybawn Belter third); ran well off her revised mark at Limerick; sights lowered again after runs at Exeter and in a Cheltenham Festival handicap.
Horse quote: 2023-12-15 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "It is nice to see La Malmason find her feet and hopefully she can go on from here. I suppose she'll be off a mark where she would warrant her place in some of those nice mares' novice chase races. We'll see what the handicapper does and take it from there - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ordinary form in beginners' chases, 5lb out of the handicap, cheekpieces may help
🔦 Spotlight: Point/bumper winner; won a maiden hurdle at Punchestown last season before struggling in two Grade 1s; soundly beaten in fourth on chase debut at Cork and has failed to improve; cheekpieces may help on handicap debut, but she is 5lb wrong; risky.
Horse quote: 2024-02-21 at Punchestown (22.5f): "Cuta Des As likes that ground and jumped well when it was needed. She's a nice big mare and one we will enjoy going over fences with in time - Willie Mullins, trainer."
