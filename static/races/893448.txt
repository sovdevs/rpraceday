🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's winner a good third at Aintree recently; the one to beat again
🔦 Spotlight: Classy operator for Jessica Harrington and took this race last year for current connections; continues in good form, wins at Belharbour (beating West Cork Wildway) and Belclare before good third in 2m5f Aintree Foxhunters early this month; looks the one to beat again.
Horse quote: 2024-04-01 at Cork (20f): "Lifetime Ambition is a lovely horse to have. He doesn't qualify for Aintree this year. He might go to Punchestown, if the griound is heavy we will wait for Killarney - Pat Doyle, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Readily beat King Alex on comeback at Dromahane 8 days ago; yard often targets this race
🔦 Spotlight: Ex Noel Meade-trained 8yo a 136-rated hurdler, winning valuable 3m Fairyhouse novice handicap at Easter 2022; returned from 533-day absence to run away (from King Alex) with Dromahane open point-to-point eight days ago and interesting contender from a yard which has won this three times in the last six years.
Horse quote: 2022-04-16 at Fairyhouse (24.5f): "Bugs Moran jumped great for him, stayed well and he loves good ground. The trip was a big help to him and he's learning on the job. He's very light and spindly. He jumps well and he'll jump fences too on fast ground - Noel Meade, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's third to Lifetime Ambition; poor Tetratema effort raises doubts
🔦 Spotlight: Career highlight when winning the Galway Plate in 2020; third to Lifetime Ambition in this race last year and kicked off this campaign with Oldcastle win before pulled up after never counting (lost shoe) in Tetratema at Gowran last month; bit to prove now.
Horse quote: 2020-07-29 at Galway (22.5f): "I got a good start and was tracking the leaders the whole way. He jumped brilliant for the first circuit but the second fence away from the stands on the second circuit he missed. I was tracking the lads going to the second last and we were proper motoring but he missed it and they got away from me a bit. It gave me something to aim at coming up the hill. He galloped all the way to the line. He won the Martin Pipe Hurdle in the past and always had the ability but has taken his time getting jumping and cheek-pieces were a big help to him and they really sharpened him up. He was well-in today and hopefully he can improve from that - Mark Walsh, rider"

🔦 Spotlight: Useful hurdler/chaser in his day; returned to point-to-points in December, notably chasing home ready winner Lifetime Ambition at Belharbour and second again at Kildorrery last time; place claims at best.
Horse quote: 2021-11-18 at Thurles (22f): "West Cork Wildway was very good today. He learned from his mistake at Killarney and he is a nice horse going forward. He'll give us a few more good days out hopefully - Paul O'Flynn, trainer."

💬 Comment: Fairyhouse winner earlier in season but fair bit to find on form since
🔦 Spotlight: Won 3m1f hunter chase at Fairyhouse in November (3m, good) but let down by jumping at Thurles and out of depth at Cheltenham latest; plenty to find.
Horse quote: 2024-11-12 at Fairyhouse (24.5f): "Lisleigh Lad wasn't right last year but was spot on for today. I don't think he'll go back pointing now and we'll stay inside the rails. He's a great jumper. I have two nice four-year-olds for point-to-points, but they're big and backward and won't be running until next year - Eleanor Broderick, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Readily beaten by Bugs Moran at Dromahane recently; hard to see him reversing the form
🔦 Spotlight: Three hurdle wins and a Limerick novice chase success for Barry Connell; point-to-point win came at Castlelands last month but has since been put in his place by Bugs Moran at Dromahane; hard to see him reversing that form.
Horse quote: 2021-12-27 at Limerick (17.5f): "King Alex won three on the bounce last year and he's a smart horse. He was brave here and ground it out. There is a valuable novice handicap chase at Naas before Cheltenham which we might go for - Barry Connell, trainer."
