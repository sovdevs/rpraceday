🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Return to AW in her favour but she might find one or two finishing off stronger
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner; placed three times in AW handicaps this year (behind Sunny Time over C&D in January) but her form dipped on turf at Bath 19 days ago; this scenario should be more suitable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unplaced in all nine starts and he has the widest stall to overcome; hood returns today
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten nearly 4l into fifth at Wolverhampton on Saturday; while that was his best run for new connections, it will need bettering if he's to overcome the widest stall; hood returns today.
