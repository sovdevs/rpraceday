💬 Comment: 2lb rise for latest Wolverhampton win not excessive; other pace to deal with & drawn wide
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark for the year when keeping on well to win a Class 6 at Wolverhampton (6f) last month; that effort backed up by the Topspeed figure and Jack Doughty's useful claim helps offset the 2lb rise; other pace on show here though and a lower draw would have been preferable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Low mileage but failed to improve for switch to handicaps last month; improvement a must
🔦 Spotlight: No improvement for the switch to handicaps when sixth of nine at Newcastle four weeks ago (6f); dropped 2lb and Hollie Doyle back on board but others look more appealing for win purposes.
