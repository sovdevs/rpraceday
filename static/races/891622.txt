🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 15-2, won 12-runner maiden at Kempton (1m, AW) in November by a nose from off the pace
🔦 Spotlight: Dante and Derby entry; brother to winners including Axana (7f-1m including triple Group 3; RPR 106); 15-2, won 12-runner maiden at Kempton (1m, AW) in November, racing freely in rear before beating a hot Godolphin favourite by a nose; had plenty to learn and is now hooded; the form has been boosted and although it's not up with the best from a few of these, he brings clear potential.
Horse quote: 2024-11-04 at Kempton (AW) (8f): "I was delighted with Aurel, he was very professional. Looking at his pedigree he was always going to be a "next year" horse so to do that first time is great - Ed Greatrex, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Losing out to a newcomer in novice at Southwell (1m, AW) 12 days ago was a shock at 2-7
🔦 Spotlight: Derby entry who's half-brother to high-class Nashwa; overcame inexperience to make a winning debut in a 1m maiden here (good to soft) last October, three weeks before his seventh of eight in the Group 1 Futurity at Doncaster (1m, soft; 16-1); losing out to a newcomer in novice at Southwell (1m, AW) 12 days ago was a shock at 2-7 but he looks well worth a go at 1m2f.
Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Newmarket (8f): "John and Thady Gosden expected Nebras to finish second or third, so he's surprised us a bit. Whether he runs again this year we don't yet know - Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to the owner."
