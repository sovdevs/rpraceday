🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rated 126 over hurdles, fine efforts in first two beginners' chases, the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard; maiden hurdle winner is 1-6 in that sphere and rated 126; beaten 9.25l by Lecky Watson on chase debut in a strong beginners' chase at Naas in December; built on that with a 4.25l second behind Harry Des Ongrais at Gowran last month; the one to beat.
