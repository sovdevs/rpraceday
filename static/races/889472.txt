üí¨ Comment: Good placed efforts around 3m last twice, latterly second in Pertemps Final at Cheltenham
üî¶ Spotlight: First six rules starts were over 2m but he proved suited by the step up to around 3m the last twice, third to the reopposing Catch Him Derry at Exeter before finishing a place in front of that rival when second to stablemate Doddiethegreat in the Pertemps Final at Cheltenham (good to soft) in first-time cheekpieces (retained); a 5lb rise shouldn't prevent another prominent showing.

üî¶ Spotlight: Went close in Grade 1 juvenile hurdle at this meeting for Gary Moore two years ago; returned from a long absence with a couple of encouraging handicap efforts (2m1f/2m3f) in December/January but never going when favourite for Imperial Cup at Sandown last month; on the back of that he steps up markedly in trip and is also fitted with the cheekpieces which have worked well on a few of the yard's runners recently, notably the Pertemps Final one-two; no shock were he to bounce back with a bang.
