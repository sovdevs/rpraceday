💬 Comment: Recaptured form for 🆕 new yard back from absence; still well treated; good claims
🔦 Spotlight: Has won on good to soft but suited by good; has recaptured form for 🆕 new yard back from absence, beating an in-form rival at Market Rasen (2m3f) and losing nothing in defeat at Carlisle (2m, good) last month; favourably treated still on past form; good claims.
Horse quote: 2022-11-29 at Southwell (16f): "Captain Ivan tends to travel well but not find too much off the bridle. They went a really good gallop though and pace in a race is what he wants. Patrick Cowley, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rekindled enthusiasm this winter, completing hat-trick latest; another win on the cards
🔦 Spotlight: Looked rather gone at the game last winter so connections and rider Jack Power have done brilliantly to get his enthusiasm back at his age; he completed the hat-trick a shade cosily at Sedgefield (2m5f, good; won on soft twice in midwinter) in March and another win is on the cards.
Horse quote: 2025-03-03 at Newcastle (23.5f): "We might've got to the front a bit too soon and The Paddy Pie is not really a three-miler, but he got away with it on that ground and he jumped superbly. He's not young, but he might just go in again - Joel Parkinson, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: Consistent last winter; mixed this time round but on the premises when fell 2 out latest
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent spell last winter included a 2m3f win at Catterick (good to soft); not having such a steady time of it this winter but he hadn't been brushed off when coming down two out in the race won by The Paddy Pie at Sedgefield last month; in the mix if shrugging that off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below best on last two starts and adding cheekpieces shows something needs to change
🔦 Spotlight: Three chase wins at Ayr (2m4f on soft/good to soft) last winter but below best there in March and at Carlisle since; Callum Pritchard takes off a helpful 5lb but adding cheekpieces acknowledges something needs to change.
Horse quote: 2024-03-08 at Ayr (20.5f): "Artic Row is an improving young horse who jumps well and he's one to look forward to. He won at the track last time and likes decent ground. He'll make a nice staying chaser next year - Nick Alexander, trainer."

💬 Comment: Winning hurdle debut last June; pulled up on handicap/chase debut last month
🔦 Spotlight: 0-6 in points but made successful hurdle debut over 2m4f at Southwell (good) last June; has more to prove on two later runs, though, particularly when pulled up on handicap/chase debut back at Southwell (3m, good) last month.
