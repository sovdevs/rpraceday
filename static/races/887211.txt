🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wind op before winning by 26l under Chad Bament at Wincanton (2m5f, good to soft); up 11lb
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent for most of last season, including on heavy; followed wind surgery (his second) in December by surging back to form with a career best to get off the mark in ten-runner handicap at Wincanton (extended 2m5f, good to soft) 13 days ago; led well before two out in that race to score easily by 26l under Chad Bament, so he's of major interest despite 11lb rise.

🔦 Spotlight: Onwards and upwards since returning from wind surgery, winning three of those five starts and he's done it with authority on good to soft at Taunton (2m3f) and Kempton (2m5f; first two 10l clear) on last two outings; there's more to prove on soft (his soft-ground third in December was over 2m) and he's up another 9lb, but such an 🚀 improver needs major respect.
