💬 Comment: Won easily at Sedgefield last week and he's ahead of the handicapper under a 7lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Suited by the drop back in trip and the return to a left-handed track when winning easily at Sedgefield (2m4f, good) last Thursday; he's ahead of the handicapper under a 7lb penalty and could play a leading role once more.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good ground may help but she's achieved little over hurdles and is hard to fancy
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a point on good going last April and she's yet to tackle such ground in a handicap; the forecast conditions offer a glimmer of hope but she's achieved little over hurdles and isn't easy to fancy.
