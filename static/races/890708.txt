🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Taken well to AW, winning easily over C&D in January; fair run in hot race here last time
🔦 Spotlight: Has taken well to Tapeta this winter, second at Newcastle on his return from an absence (pulled hard) before easily seeing off Legal Reform (runs in the 6.30) over C&D in January; came up short off this mark here four weeks ago, weakening in the final furlong, but that was still a solid run in what was a hot Class 2; 🔥 big player back in these calmer waters.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wouldn't judge him harshly on last two runs; dangerous mark if getting a pace to run at
🔦 Spotlight: Conditions to suit and although being well into the veteran stage, has run creditably in races that haven't set up ideally for him the last twice; good mark but no guarantee this will be strongly run either.
