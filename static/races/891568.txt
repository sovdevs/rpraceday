🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed for Listed win on Lingfield AW last month to make it 3-4; player
🔦 Spotlight: Made debut in January and all four starts have been on AW; won over 6f on first two outings and made it 3-4 with 7f Listed win at Lingfield last month; in tougher company today but he impressed last time, showing smart acceleration, and his brother was a 6f Group 2 runner-up on turf; player.
Horse quote: 2025-01-23 at Newcastle (AW) (6f): "Rebel's Gamble was really more professional today. The first day at Southwell he was very green and babyish, and today he's sharpened up a lot from that first run. He picked up and put the race to bed pretty quick - Clifford Lee, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went very close in the Coventry over C&D last June; reappears with yard in fine form
🔦 Spotlight: Went very close in the Group 2 Coventry Stakes over C&D (good to firm) at last year's Royal meeting and he got back on track with a Group 3 win at Chantilly (6f, good) last September when last seen; reappears with yard in fine form and he could play a leading role.
Horse quote: 2024-09-21 at Chantilly (6f): "Electrolyte deserved that and I think we're learning more about him. We stepped him up to seven furlongs at Goodwood, but I think he showed there that coming back to six furlongs was the right thing. We won this race with Eddie's Boy and he went back three weeks later for the Criterium de Maisons-Laffitte. That is the most obvious option [for Electrolyte] but Mickael did say to me that he wouldn't be running him if the ground was heavy - Archie Watson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy 5f form last season; outstayed on sole 6f run but could be a stronger horse now
🔦 Spotlight: Won Group 3 Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood (5f, good to firm) last July and campaign concluded with neck second in the Group 2 Flying Childers (5f, good) then close fourth at the Breeders' Cup (5f, firm); wind op since; outstayed when fourth in the Group 2 Gimcrack over 6f at York last August and has stamina to prove, but it's possible he's a stronger horse now eight months on.
Horse quote: 2024-07-31 at Goodwood (5f): "It's great, Big Mojo is an exciting horse and he's improved a lot since his debut. It's a nice way to break a maiden, in a Group 3 race, and he's a pro horse. He's only going to improve. He's got a lot of speed and I like him over six as well. He's a quality horse going forward, he's strong physically but mentally he's not there yet - Silvestre de Sousa, rider."

💬 Comment: Won over 1m at Meydan in January but bred for sprinting; no surprise to see bold show
🔦 Spotlight: Won valuable sales race at Doncaster (6.5f, good) last September and took the Guineas Trial at Meydan (1m, good to firm) in January; disappointing in 1m Listed race at Meydan since; drops back in trip today but he's bred for sprinting on the dam's side and it will be no surprise to see a bold show.
Horse quote: 2024-09-12 at Doncaster (6.5f): "Will (Buick, jockey) was very pleased with Hallasan and he's toughed it out well. He's a small horse, and we thought he was going to be an early one, but actually he's taken a little while to come to himself. I spoke to the trainer (Charlie Appleby) just now and he thought he might be one to take over to Dubai and see how he goes over there - Alex Merriam, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Group 3 and Group 2 wins at Chantilly last summer; may have needed reappearance run
🔦 Spotlight: All six starts have been on ground slower than good; won Group 3 and Group 2 races over 6f at Chantilly last summer before creditable fourth in the Group 1 Prix Morny; soundly beaten fourth on reappearance in Deauville Group 3 but may have needed the run and is not ruled out in a first-time visor.
Horse quote: 2024-07-14 at Chantilly (6f): "That was brilliant, I'm delighted. Arabie has a lot of ability but he's very idle, very lazy. He does only what you ask him. But his homework has definitely improved from his last run going into this one and I was pretty bullish that he'd run a big race. I thought it would take a good horse to beat him. He was a little bit slowly away, he stood in the stalls for a while and I was a bit worried for a second or two, but Jim [Crowley, jockey] is very experienced and got him off the rail and round. I actually expected him to be under pressure a little bit earlier than he was. He'll go to the Prix Morny  and he'll run very well in it - Karl Burke, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won the 5f Windsor Castle at the Royal meeting and 6f is well worth another go
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 2-2 in the Listed Windsor Castle at the Royal meeting here (5f, good to firm) last June; faded over 6f in the July Stakes but kept on well for sixth in the Group 2 Flying Childers at Doncaster (5f, good) in September when last seen and is well worth another go at 6f on his reappearance.
Horse quote: 2024-06-19 at Ascot (5f): "It panned out perfectly. Obviously it was such a big field you don't know what's going to happen. After going 100 yards, I was following the American horse, getting a good lead and he was always going to bring me as far as I wanted, and Ain't Nobody was tough at the finish. He's a nice horse for the future, he's only a young horse on his second run, so plenty to look forward to - Jamie Spencer, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Trained by Sylvester Kirk last year; won valuable sales race at Newmarket (6f, soft) last August and close third in Kempton Group 3 (6f, AW) next time; however, others have more substance to their form and his best turf efforts thus far have been on slow ground; stable debut (remains in same ownership).
Horse quote: 2024-06-22 at Ascot (7f): "I'm just delighted with that. Brian was a very cheap horse. He's a lovely horse and tries very hard. We are delighted with how he ran - Liam Keniry, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Redcar (6f): "Candy is growing and strengthening so I don't see why he shouldn't make a three-year-old but as he's in such good form at the moment if he comes out of this race well we'll have to look to see if there's anything for him - Richard Spencer, trainer."
