🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning return to hurdles recently; respected back over fences if he has turned a corner
🔦 Spotlight: Some promise over hurdles for Evan Williams early last year, but three starts over fences after returning in November didn't go to plan; made a successful return to hurdles on stable debut at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) nine days ago and although he has something to prove back over fences, is respected if he has generally turned a corner.
