🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in two soft-ground chases since tongue-tie was added; likely contender
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 6yo who was seemingly aided by a tongue-tie when second in soft-ground chases at Warwick (2m) and Catterick (1m7f) this winter; usually ridden patiently; has good chance here if he handles the quicker conditions.

💬 Comment: Showed only minor promise over hurdles; may improve on this chase/handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Very 🔍 unexposed 7yo; showed nothing more than minor promise in three maiden/novice hurdles this season (2m-2m1f) but was placed in two Irish points in 2022 and is open to improvement on this chase/handicap debut; tongue-tie fitted.
