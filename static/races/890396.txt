🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well suited by drop to 1m when making all at Doncaster final 3yo start; more to come
🔦 Spotlight: Successful over 1m2f but quite a free-goer and looked well suited by the drop back to 1m and being allowed to stride on when making all in 12-runner Doncaster handicap (soft) on final 3yo start; his new triple-figure rating demands a smart handicap performance but this lightly raced 4yo is probably capable of one.
Horse quote: 2024-04-15 at Windsor (10f): "The dream is still alive, so we'll see how we get on. I think Harper's Ferry warrants being put in a trial because he's bred to be that kind of horse as he's by a French Derby winner and out of an Oaks winner, so we have to stick him in and see where we are. He'll be a better horse in better races and he has a really high cruising speed. I'm very happy, it's a big relief really. I was disappointed he got beat at Doncaster. He's been shaping up well and he really improved for the run, but we were unfortunate to run into another one too good last time. The better ground here suited and the experience will help - Ed Walker, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very 📈 progressive as a 3yo, winning four and second to Bullet Point over C&D; player
🔦 Spotlight: Big 🚀 improver in handicaps at around 1m last year, winning four times and second to the reopposing Bullet Point over C&D (soft) on final start; same connections' City Of Delight had a similarly 📈 progressive profile as a 3yo and improved again to win a competitive Doncaster handicap on reappearance last month; no surprise were this one to do likewise.
Horse quote: 2024-08-12 at Kempton (AW) (8f): "Tribal Chief has been quite a green horse, that's why we decided to geld him at the end of the winter to try to get him to progress mentally. Now, he's racing much more professionally, and we can see the improvements. The plan is to give him time to keep on improving. Physically, he's not quite there either, so he'll improve this year and next year as well. In time, he'll stay well. Even though he is from the family of Little Big Bear, there's a fair bit of stamina on the dam's side as well. He'll tackle some longer trips, but we're not sure how much further he'll get - David Menuisier, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very 📈 progressive as a 3yo, winning four and second to Bullet Point over C&D; player
🔦 Spotlight: Big 🚀 improver in handicaps at around 1m last year, winning four times and second to the reopposing Bullet Point over C&D (soft) on final start; same connections' City Of Delight had a similarly 📈 progressive profile as a 3yo and improved again to win a competitive Doncaster handicap on reappearance last month; no surprise were this one to do likewise.

💬 Comment: Two July Course wins last year; ran okay on AW over winter and back on winning mark
🔦 Spotlight: Winner over 7f and 1m (both good) on the July Course last summer; some respectable runs on AW this winter and he returns to the grass off his last winning mark.
Horse quote: 2022-05-09 at Wolverhampton (AW) (5f): "We've worked back from Royal Ascot with Waiting All Night and he could run again before then. He's not just a five-furlong horse and we have a few more of Rajasinghe's progeny and other two-year-olds to run in the next few weeks, so we'll hopefully have a strong team for the meeting. It's hard to win from such a wide draw here, particularly on debut, so he's done very well and it shows the ability he has and attitude to go with it - Richard Spencer, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-09-03 at Ascot (7f): "I had no idea whether I'd won or not, but Urban Sprawl is game and he's in good form. He was really gunning for the line and he was able to stick his head down where it matters. He's tough - David Probert, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-14 last year but recorded some good efforts in strong races and he's a former C&D winner
🔦 Spotlight: Won this off 1lb higher on good to soft in 2023; drew a blank in 14 starts last year but that doesn't tell the whole story as there were some good efforts in strong handicaps, including third of 18 in Challenge Cup at Ascot in October; first outing for six months.
Horse quote: 2023-04-18 at Newmarket (8f): "Ours were needing the run and the Lincoln run might have just put Bopedro right. Lee Bond (owner) told me to leave the visor off as it might just freshen him up so I have to give him the credit for it. He had good form for Jessie Harrington and there is a good programme for these milers - David O'Meara, trainer."
