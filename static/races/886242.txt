💬 Comment: Best work late when fourth of 12 on Warwick debut; key player.
🔦 Spotlight: 32,000euros 3yo; half-brother to a 2m4f/3m chase winner; did best work late when fourth of 12 on Warwick debut two months ago; that form remains largely untested but trainer has a 27% bumper strike-rate here (8-30) over the last five years; of clear interest.
