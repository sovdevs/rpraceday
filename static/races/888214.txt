🔦 Spotlight: Latest win was off 5lb lower at Doncaster in February last year (3m, soft); best run since when third in a 3m5f handicap at Bangor last time (soft) when blinkered for the first time; cheekpieces on for second time (fell previous occasion); rare stable runner here; drying ground a slight concern but has a chance.
