💬 Comment: Slightly disappointing over 3m last month but beat smart rival on hurdle debut (2m4f)
🔦 Spotlight: Slightly disappointing when upped to 3m for good-quality Musselburgh novice last month but kept on too strongly for recent Grade 2 winner Jet To Vegas on hurdling debut there (2m4f, good to soft) in December and will be a tough nut to crack if coping with today's drop in trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful Flat racer who signed off for David O'Meara with 1m2f AW win in October; just a respectable third on last month's stable/hurdle debut at Musselburgh (1m7f, good to soft) but has plenty of scope to build on that performance.
