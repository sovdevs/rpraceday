🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't see out 7f on Tapeta latest; player if responding positively to the blinkers.
🔦 Spotlight: Missed the podium for the first time in six runs when finding 7f too far at Newcastle latest; too inclined to hang under pressure late on for maximum confidence, but he sets the clear form standard on last autumn's Tapeta seconds (5f/6f) in particular; blinkers added.

🔦 Spotlight: Best of two efforts was recorded on debut here last month (beaten 7l, modest form); refusal to settle, despite a hood for both starts, has probably been the key problem rather than the 7f.
