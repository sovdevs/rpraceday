🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Modest strike-rate on the Flat but has won over C&D and arrives in good form
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-17 on the Flat but that win came over C&D last June and he's been in good form back in this code the last twice, finishing third of 19 at Doncaster (1m2f, good to soft) then fourth of seven here (1m4f, good) where twice denied a clear run; every chance he'll be bang there.

🔦 Spotlight: He has an in-and-out profile but has won three times since last June, the latest at Wolverhampton (1m4f, AW) in January; didn't enjoy a clear run when fifth of seven here (1m4f) last week and is not discounted.
Horse quote: 2023-05-23 at Huntingdon (16f): "I didn't want to hit the front too soon on Sisterandbrother as he was keen early and he picked them up well. I don't know how strong the race was but it was only his second run over hurdles so he could be a fun summer horse - Harry Cobden, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-08-17 at Ripon (10f): "We were unsure as Bay Dream Believer had a 5lb penalty and was only put up 2lb for her last win so it was a bit of a gamble but the prize money was good for the grade and she came out of the race really well. She's only a little pony but she tries hard - trainer Mark Walford."
