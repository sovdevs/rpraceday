💬 Comment: Found only one too good on recent stable debut at Fontwell; up another 3lb for that
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice earlier in the season and found only one too good on recent stable debut at Fontwell (2m1f, good); up 3lb and that gives him little margin for error, but can still make presence felt.

🔦 Spotlight: Form figures of 81131 since fitted with this headgear combination and had a nice bit in hand last time at Chepstow (2m, good); raised 8lb but Cameron Iles can claim 5lb instead of the 3lb he did last time; solid claims.

💬 Comment: Probably not on that bad a mark should the tongue-tie trigger a return to form
🔦 Spotlight: Won a three-runner maiden on hurdle/stable debut here in November (good); soft ground perhaps not ideal in her next two races but good to soft should have been okay at Kelso and yet that was her worst run yet; perhaps the tongue-tie can trigger a return to form.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual Flat winner at about 7f; has shown he can stay the trip over hurdles but was well held in two handicaps before struggling in a Perth maiden (first-time tongue-tie); the return of a hood is no bad thing but he's unconvincing back from a break.
