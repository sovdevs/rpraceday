🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very encouraging Navan comeback run; better ground to suit and likely major player
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time hurdles winner, including C&D win four years ago; very encouraging comeback run at Navan last month when staying on third behind a revitalised rival (won again since) over 2m4f (heavy); better ground to suit and likely major player off a nice mark.
Horse quote: 2021-02-28 at Naas (15.5f): "Zoffanien has run into one or two but did it well today. He had to, if he's going to Cheltenham he would have to have done that well today. Hopefully he will get there in one piece - Denis Hogan, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2m6f winner here last May; back from winter break and trip on the short side
🔦 Spotlight: Won a valuable 2m6f handicap here last May (good) and mostly good runs since including on the Flat; plenty keen when last seen in October when well beaten; clearly likes this venue but trip on the short side.

Horse quote: 2024-05-27 at Ballinrobe (17.5f): "Coming here today it looked a hot beginners', but then the favourite came out. I still thought it would be tough task against a 137-rated chaser in Mighty Tom, but Extrapolation loves good ground like that and it's terrific to get the win - Richard O'Brien, trainer."
