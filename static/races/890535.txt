🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seemingly back in good nick when second at Haydock last month; still on workable mark
🔦 Spotlight: Suffered dip in form after last summer's winning stable debut at Cartmel (2m6f, heavy) but was seemingly back in good nick when second at Haydock (3m, good) last month and is still on a workable mark.
Horse quote: 2023-04-08 at Haydock (24.5f): "Tiger Jet scraped in off a light weight. The horse obviously loves the good ground. Brian Ellison said he'd had him away and worked him this week and he'd gone really well. We've been dropping him in and he's been too keen whereas today he was still as keen but I was a lot nearer to the pace and he didn't have as much work to do - Henry Brooke, jockey."
