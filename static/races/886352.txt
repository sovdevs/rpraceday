🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good claims on recent 1m4f form at Wolverhampton; mixed messages on course form in 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Came out best in a tussle with Come On John at Wolverhampton after Christmas (1m4f; pair clear of two subsequent winners) and another solid effort behind one on a four-timer back there last week; good claims off the same mark but mixed messages from his course form in 2023.
