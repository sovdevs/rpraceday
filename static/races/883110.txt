🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unbeaten mare, last time posting a serious RPR in winning a 2m7f Grade 2 at Limerick
🔦 Spotlight: Bred for the job as a half-sister to the 2023 winner Stay Away Fay; bought for £120,000 after winning her point and remains unbeaten after winning both her hurdle races, repelling Argento Boy in a maiden (2m5f) before displaying plenty of stamina in winning a 2m7f Grade 2 at Limerick (smart RPR given they went a steady pace; on yielding to soft); it's difficult to gauge how good this scopey mare is and the fact no female has won this race carries little significance when so few have tried.

💬 Comment: The form of his 2nd in the 2m4f Grade 1 Challow brings him into this and he was staying on
🔦 Spotlight: 1-3 in points and 2-3 in bumpers; beaten at Hexham on his hurdling debut but then won well at Ludlow and showed that he belonged in this company when best of the rest behind The New Lion in the Grade 1 Challow at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) where he produced his best work late in the day; massively odds-on when easily making all in a Wetherby novice (2m3f, soft) and rates a likely contender with this longer trip a probable plus.

🔦 Spotlight: Won three of his ten bumpers in France and also a 2m2f hurdle race in October; moved stables after changing hands for 220,000euros in November and a month later created quite an impression when decisively winning a Grade 2 here (good to soft) on his first foray over 3m, with subsequent Grade 2 winner Yellow Car left trailing in his wake; winning course form has regularly featured on successful CVs in this race and he's accrued plenty of experience; hard to knock.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the bumper here last year but 3m could now suit should his jumping stand the test
🔦 Spotlight: Won last year's Champion Bumper but hasn't looked a natural over hurdles, even when winning his 2m maiden that's worked out really well; comfortably beaten in 2m4f/2m6f Grade 1s the last twice, though he was boxing on in the latest (in first-time cheekpieces which are now discarded) and this longer trip could put a spring in his step should his jumping pass the test; dangerous to dismiss with Paul Townend back aboard; his standout form is on soft ground.

💬 Comment: Has raced on only soft or heavy ground but he's 4-4 and looking a hot prospect
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who extended his unbeaten record to three under rules (tongue tied in all) when digging deep to edge out a previous Listed winner in a 3m novice at Windsor in January; looks hot property with the future in mind and should be in his element with this stiffer stamina test provided by the New course; has raced on only soft or heavy ground but he's well thought of by his respected yard that won this in 2012 and had a fourth Festival winner on Tuesday.

🔦 Spotlight: Has been making hay in softer races all season and he's not beaten anything of note in his most recent wins here (good) and at Musselburgh (good to soft); however, those were over 3m so he's an assured stayer, and already having nine hurdle starts in the bag is a selling point when many past winners of this were well stocked up on experience; should give his running.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fourth in last year's bumper here but opposable on what he's shown over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Outran his odds when a closing fourth in last year's Champion Bumper; the form of his first two efforts in maiden hurdles were underwhelming and he offered little in a 2m6f Grade 1 at the Dublin Racing Festival when behind Wingmen and Jasmin De Vaux.

🔦 Spotlight: Cost £300,000 after winning his point (3m, soft) and he followed up in a Gowran bumper (2m2f, heavy); improved with each of his races over hurdles but he wasn't that impressive last time when winning a Punchestown maiden (extended 2m3f, heavy; second has won since); may prefer testing ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5th in last year's bumper here; recent 2m4f winner; stamina could be his forte
🔦 Spotlight: Fifth in last season's Champion Bumper; his jumping was hit and miss when a beaten favourite in his first hurdle start (2m7f; yielding; behind stablemate Inn At The Park) but he found greater fluency in front when making all at Fairyhouse (2m4f, soft); connections have hinted that staying will be his game and this sort of test could well trigger a spike in form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual 2m3f Ascot winner; trainer describes him as a relentless galloper; could improve
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins under rules have come on good ground over Ascot's extended 2m3f, on either side of finishing tailed off in the Grade 1 Challow; raised markedly in trip here but he won his 3m point on heavy and his trainer describes him as a relentless galloper; possible 🚀 improver.

💬 Comment: Gave up the ghost quite tamely when behind some of these in a 3m Grade 2 at Doncaster
🔦 Spotlight: Won his 3m point on heavy ground so should stay okay; made all in a 2m4f maiden on soft at Ffos Las but he gave up the ghost quite tamely when behind some of these in a 3m Grade 2 at Doncaster in January (good to soft); opposable on the back of that effort.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looks in need of 3m but wouldn't be the obvious answer on what he's shown to date
🔦 Spotlight: Fetched £260,000 after winning his Irish point; returning from a long absence when promoted to second in a Newbury novice and, in a new tongue-tie (retained), he was left clear at the final flight to win a Huntingdon maiden (2m4f, good to soft) by daylight; already looks as though he needs this sort of trip but wouldn't be the obvious answer on what he's shown to date.

💬 Comment: Beaten favourite over this far at Doncaster but could have done with a more truly run race
🔦 Spotlight: Failed in his hat-trick bid when made favourite for the Grade 2 River Don at Doncaster (3m) but, while that was his first attempt over this far, he shaped as though a more truly run race would have benefited him; like many in here, the potential is there for a career best.
