üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Unbeaten mare, last time posting a serious RPR in winning a 2m7f Grade 2 at Limerick
üî¶ Spotlight: Bred for the job as a half-sister to the 2023 winner Stay Away Fay; bought for ¬£120,000 after winning her point and remains unbeaten after winning both her hurdle races, repelling Argento Boy in a maiden (2m5f) before displaying plenty of stamina in winning a 2m7f Grade 2 at Limerick (smart RPR given they went a steady pace; on yielding to soft); it's difficult to gauge how good this scopey mare is and the fact no female has won this race carries little significance when so few have tried.

üî¶ Spotlight: 1-3 in points and 2-3 in bumpers; beaten at Hexham on his hurdling debut but then won well at Ludlow and showed that he belonged in this company when best of the rest behind The New Lion in the Grade 1 Challow at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) where he produced his best work late in the day; massively odds-on when easily making all in a Wetherby novice (2m3f, soft) and rates a likely contender with this longer trip a probable plus.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: His jumping hasn't been pretty and all his best form is in the mud, but ability respected
üî¶ Spotlight: Won a bumper before offering little in the Grade 1s here and at Punchestown; had another blip in his second maiden hurdle but likeable efforts either side of that, pushing The Big Westerner close in the first despite racing with the choke out and last time winning as he liked at Punchestown (2m7f, heavy); his jumping hasn't been pretty and all his best form is in the mud, but the raw ability he has is respected; shortlisted.

üí¨ Comment: Won the bumper here last year but 3m could now suit should his jumping stand the test
üî¶ Spotlight: Won last year's Champion Bumper but hasn't looked a natural over hurdles, even when winning his 2m maiden that's worked out really well; comfortably beaten in 2m4f/2m6f Grade 1s the last twice, though he was boxing on in the latest (in first-time cheekpieces which are now discarded) and this longer trip could put a spring in his step should his jumping pass the test; dangerous to dismiss with Paul Townend back aboard; his standout form is on soft ground.

üí¨ Comment: Has a bit to find but he's already won at the trip and is stocked up on experience
üî¶ Spotlight: Has been making hay in softer races all season and he's not beaten anything of note in his most recent wins here (good) and at Musselburgh (good to soft); however, those were over 3m so he's an assured stayer, and already having nine hurdle starts in the bag is a selling point when many past winners of this were well stocked up on experience; should give his running.

üî¶ Spotlight: Found 2m3f too sharp a test three runs back but üìà progressive otherwise this season at up to 3m and he had Ma Shantou and Jig's Forge behind when digging deepest in a Grade 2 at Doncaster last time (3m, good to soft); this demands a whole lot more and he has plenty to find with Jet Blue on their clash here in December.

üí¨ Comment: Could improve for 3m but this is a tough race in which to make all (that's his style)
üî¶ Spotlight: Seemingly all the better for wind surgery when making all for clearcut wins at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) and Ascot (2m5f, good) before just falling short under the same tactics in a Listed race at Huntingdon (2m3f, good to soft); worth a crack over this far but this is a tough race in which to dominate from the front should they persevere with the same tactics.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Looks in need of 3m but wouldn't be the obvious answer on what he's shown to date
üî¶ Spotlight: Fetched ¬£260,000 after winning his Irish point; returning from a long absence when promoted to second in a Newbury novice and, in a new tongue-tie (retained), he was left clear at the final flight to win a Huntingdon maiden (2m4f, good to soft) by daylight; already looks as though he needs this sort of trip but wouldn't be the obvious answer on what he's shown to date.

üî¶ Spotlight: Failed in his hat-trick bid when made favourite for the Grade 2 River Don at Doncaster (3m) but, while that was his first attempt over this far, he shaped as though a more truly run race would have benefited him; like many in here, the potential is there for a career best.
