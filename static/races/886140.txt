💬 Comment: Last start was over fences when fifth of 11 finishers at Worcester last July.
🔦 Spotlight: Has a modest strike rate of 1-45 under rules and yet to strike over hurdles; last start was over fences when fifth of 11 finishers at Worcester (2m5f, good) last July; left DJ Jeffreys for £1,000 in September; may be best watched on stable debut.
