🔦 Spotlight: Caught the eye when fifth at Kempton in March before winning there (again 7f) 11 days ago, despite racing freely again; 📈 progressive since handicapping and, having been raised 4lb, he's respected back on turf granted that he doesn't pull his chance away.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has been off since winning on handicap debut in February; could have more to offer.
🔦 Spotlight: Showed improved form when winning on handicap debut at Wolverhampton  (7f, AW) in February on her second start for this yard; up 4lb and off since, but she's well bred (out of a Group 1 winner) and could have more to offer now back on turf for first time since soft-ground debut.
Horse quote: 2025-02-03 at Wolverhampton (AW) (7f): "We were quite clear we wanted to get cover on Ornately and it worked out quite nicely. She settled well and David Evans's horse [Piranha Rama] dragged us all the way to the furlong pole. She's done it well - Daniel Muscutt, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Second or third in her first three handicaps before winning well at Kempton (7f); never got involved at Wolverhampton after being raised 8lb; improvement came when switched to AW so the return to turf asks questions; more needed.

💬 Comment: Sole win came here on debut; 6l behind Knights Gold at Kempton last time.
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win came on debut last April here over 5f on soft ground; didn't make an impact in Dubai this winter and 6l fifth (behind Knights Gold) in first-time cheekpieces at Kempton 11 days ago; bit to find on that form and needs the return to this venue to make a difference.
Horse quote: 2024-04-27 at Leicester (5f): "It's hard to know what he has beaten but Blewburton is a nice horse. He wants six furlongs but they went hard and it suited him. It can be tricky with a penalty and we may look at the Woodcote at Epsom - Eve Johnson Houghton, trainer."
