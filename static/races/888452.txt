🔦 Spotlight: Has looked rather unlucky not to have added to his two C&D wins in January including when going down narrowly to Phoenix Beach back here on Tuesday, but he has it all to do from the outside stall this time.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Triple C&D winner who is weighted to reverse last month's running with Maharajas Express
🔦 Spotlight: Won three times over C&D last year and was returning from four months off when beaten less than a length into third of ten behind Maharajas Express back here 19 days ago; enjoys a 5lb pull with his old rival (whom he had beaten on the other two occasions they met on the AW) and respected from the inside stall.

💬 Comment: Record over C&D reads 23132321; each-way shout despite 5lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Record over C&D reads 23132321 and he had dropped below his previous winning mark when beating Buraback by half a length here on Tuesday; not quite as well drawn here as he was then and has a 5lb penalty to carry, but his record under these conditions still makes him a solid each-way shout; stable also runs Anglesey Lad.
