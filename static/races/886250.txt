🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Front-runner who ran well dropped back to 2m last time; stays 3m; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who went down narrowly last time at Uttoxeter (2m, good to soft), which was a good run over that far for one who stays 3m; Harry Atkins rides again and should hang around to have some say.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ability respected but appeared to try and run out when unseating mid-race at Windsor
🔦 Spotlight: Second win over fences when keeping on well to beat 12 rivals in a 2m4f Cheltenham handicap for mares in December (good to soft) and appeared to lose her concentration when unseating mid-race at Windsor; that raises some alarms as it appeared she tried to run out, but the ability is there to be competitive.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form until Fakenham last time and that track doesn't suit all horses
🔦 Spotlight: Usually runs well here and she's only 4lb higher than when a 5l winner at Warwick in November (2m4f, good to soft); followed that with a good run behind Game On For Glory at Cheltenham and perhaps Fakenham didn't float her boat last time; respected.
