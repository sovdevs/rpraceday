🔦 Spotlight: Dubawi filly from a stellar Cheveley Park family; went off 9-2 at Newbury (7f, good) last month and saw her race out on the front foot after being slow to break; should know much more this time and she has plenty of scope for progress upped in trip; key player.

💬 Comment: Eyecatching fourth on stable debut at Kempton (1m) last month and she's in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Sixth of seven at Newbury in sole run for Sir Michael Stoute last season but she left that form behind with an eyecatching fourth on stable debut at Kempton (1m) last month; didn't get the best of runs in that race and she could take another good step forward on this switch to Tapeta.
