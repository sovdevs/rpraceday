💬 Comment: Won 17-runner handicap hurdle here by 8l; still well treated on pick of his old form
🔦 Spotlight: Winner for Gordon Elliott in 2021; impressive debut for new stable after 541 days off the track when winning 17-runner apprentice handicap hurdle here over 2m3f by 8l last month; still well treated on pick of his old form if he can back that up.

🔦 Spotlight: Wasn't far behind Well Dressed on her debut here last February; travelled well for a long way in first-time tongue-tie when third in C&D maiden hurdle in November (runner-up progressive since and now rated 125); bottomless ground possibly to blame for latest run but fascinating contender on handicap debut.
