💬 Comment: Easy C&D win 12 days ago but that race was less competitive than this one and she's up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways when readily accounting for seven rivals over C&D 12 days ago; the short-priced favourite fluffed the start there and the race may not have taken much winning; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question of her.

💬 Comment: Two 6f wins this winter; solid placed efforts the last twice; 0-21 over 7f+
🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f wins around the turn of the year; similar form in defeat the last twice; 0-21 over 7f+ but he's fully effective over C&D; should run well but this might prove too competitive.

🔦 Spotlight: Made all to win a 1m handicap at Newcastle last April off this mark; followed up at Doncaster 19 days later (both for Harriet Bethell) but his form went south after joining Michael Attwater last July; sold for 2,000gns in October; Richard Kingscote, who knows him well, is an interesting booking and a big run could be forthcoming.

🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways when readily accounting for seven rivals over C&D 12 days ago; the short-priced favourite fluffed the start there and the race may not have taken much winning; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question of her.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins last year, one of them here (8.6f); improving when last seen in September but he'll need another step forward to take this after an absence; that's not out of the question though.

🔦 Spotlight: Made all to win a 1m handicap at Newcastle last April off this mark; followed up at Doncaster 19 days later (both for Harriet Bethell) but his form went south after joining Michael Attwater last July; sold for 2,000gns in October; Richard Kingscote, who knows him well, is an interesting booking and a big run could be forthcoming.

💬 Comment: Easy C&D win 12 days ago but that race was less competitive than this one and she's up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways when readily accounting for seven rivals over C&D 12 days ago; the short-priced favourite fluffed the start there and the race may not have taken much winning; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question of her.

💬 Comment: C&D win last month; two of her three runs since have been fine; often slowly away
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the 17th attempt when winning a C&D handicap last month; two of her three runs since have been respectable and she's not ruled out despite her being a short price to blow the start.
