💬 Comment: Five wins since November, the latest an impressive success at Southwell; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins for his new stable this winter, the latest when coming from well back to win decisively at Southwell nine days ago; up 6lb but should get a pace to aim at and he's still of major interest at this level.

💬 Comment: Easy C&D win 12 days ago but that race was less competitive than this one and she's up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways when readily accounting for seven rivals over C&D 12 days ago; the short-priced favourite fluffed the start there and the race may not have taken much winning; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question of her.
