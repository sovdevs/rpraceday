💬 Comment: Easy C&D win 12 days ago but that race was less competitive than this one and she's up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways when readily accounting for seven rivals over C&D 12 days ago; the short-priced favourite fluffed the start there and the race may not have taken much winning; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question of her.

💬 Comment: Two 6f wins this winter; solid placed efforts the last twice; 0-21 over 7f+
🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f wins around the turn of the year; similar form in defeat the last twice; 0-21 over 7f+ but he's fully effective over C&D; should run well but this might prove too competitive.

💬 Comment: Easy C&D win 12 days ago but that race was less competitive than this one and she's up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways when readily accounting for seven rivals over C&D 12 days ago; the short-priced favourite fluffed the start there and the race may not have taken much winning; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question of her.
