🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up latest but on soft going; retains potential judged on previous good-ground form
🔦 Spotlight: Point (2m4f, good) and maiden hurdle (2m4f, good) winner who scored on his handicap and chase debut at Taunton (2m7f, good) in December; pulled up at Wincanton last month but on soft ground that may not have suited; retains plenty of potential for top yard now back over fences.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in November on first two chase starts (2m4f/3m, good) before making all at Market Rasen (3m, soft); ran well when second at Ludlow (3m, good to soft) last month, when he was badly hampered by a loose horse, and this 📈 progressive sort can make a bold bid.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over hurdles recently and this two-time point winner is of interest now back chasing
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 10yo who well beaten at Chepstow in November on sole chase start, but she lacked a recent run; won over hurdles at Ludlow (3m, soft) recently and this two-time point winner (effective on good ground in that sphere) may well come good over fences at the second attempt.
