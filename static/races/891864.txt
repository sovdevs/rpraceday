🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Green but clear signs of ability in the Wood Ditton (1m) 15 days ago; can do much better
🔦 Spotlight: Brother to 1m2f Listed winner Al Asifah; market drifter in the Wood Ditton at Newmarket (1m, good) on debut two weeks ago when he looked in need of the experience and didn't seem at ease on the track in the closing stages; could prove a different proposition with that run behind him and he's an interesting contender now upped in trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced in two runs in Dubai in January but he showed ability and there were some smart opponents in those contests; in much calmer waters today and there is encouragement for AW on pedigree; not a certain stayer on breeding but he's still more interesting than many.

💬 Comment: Debut 4th came in a slowly-run race; well beaten at Newmarket since (pulled hard); risky
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped well in a slowly-run 8.6f novice at Wolverhampton on his debut in March; pulled hard when remote in a 1m2f novice at Newmarket 15 days ago (22-1); likely to do better at some point but will need to settle to fulfil his potential.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat a good horse when winning his bumper in November; bred for the Flat; check betting
🔦 Spotlight: In need of the experience on his debut in a Huntingdon junior bumper in November (2m, good to soft) but he still managed to win comfortably and the form has been franked by the runner-up (fourth in the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham); bred to have a future on the Flat and the standard to aim at isn't daunting.

🔦 Spotlight: 72,000gns yearling, 72,000gns breeze-up 2yo; sixth foal; closely related to winners Positive Impact (7f turf/1m AW; RPR 109) and Desert Rhapsody (French 1m), half-brother to three winners including Turntable (1m-1m2f; 101); dam 6f AW 2yo/1m turf winner (100); hooded for debut; stable, who also run Kurakka, not renowned for winning newcomers but pedigree dictates he needs a 📊 market check.
