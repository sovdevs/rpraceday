📝 Comment: disputed lead, lost ground but in touch with leader before 2nd, hit 9th, pushed along and headway after 3 out, edged left after 2 out, 🎯 led just before last, ridden and kept on inside final 110yds (trainer said, regarding the apparent improvement in form, that gelding appeared to benefit from racing left-handed having raced right-handed on his two previous runs, and had further benefitted from the going, which was officially described as good to soft (good in places) on this occasion, but in her opinion was riding quicker than described)
