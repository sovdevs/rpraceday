🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Professional all round when making all in a four-runner maiden at Ascot
🔦 Spotlight: Point/bumper winner; he wasn't progressing as hoped over hurdles but was very professional all round when making all in a four-runner maiden at Ascot (2m3f, good) three weeks ago; it's questionable what he achieved but hopefully onwards and upwards.
Horse quote: 2025-03-30 at Ascot (19.5f): "Wicked Thoughts liked that back down in trip and, like a few of ours, he wasn't quite right before, but he looked great in his coat. He's not a big, heavy horse, but he skipped off that ground and he loved it. He jumped really well. His form at Exeter on fast ground, when he gave weight away to Nicky's [Henderson's] horse [Kingston Pride], who was actually all right, it made me think he'd have a good chance - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had no excuses when second here yesterday after enjoying an easy lead
🔦 Spotlight: Useful stayer on the Flat; odds-on winner of a Sedgefield novice hurdle (2m1f, good) but had no excuses when second here yesterday after enjoying an easy lead.
Horse quote: 2024-11-26 at Sedgefield (17f): "Mr Escobar wouldn't have been good enough to win a maiden hurdle in Ireland, so Patrick and Willie thought they might as well come here and try to win a maiden. He's a bit quirky. He didn't jump round one day at Killarney, he ran out before the [first] hurdle, so that's in the back of your mind going down to the first. I just thought the best of the ground was out wide, but it didn't matter and he would have still won anyway. It was nice to get it done. The track suited him, it kept him interested, and I was delighted with the way he jumped - Brian Hayes, rider, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Holds Authentic Legacy on their latest clash; an improving first-season hurdler
🔦 Spotlight: The only real blip in his career was when pulled up in the EBF Final at Sandown and that's always a tough race; redeemed himself when making light work of Authentic Legacy in a Fontwell novice (2m5f, good) and he's better off at the weights with that rival; there are others to worry about but he's respected.
Horse quote: 2025-01-11 at Ffos Las (20f): "Elysian Knight ran well at Plumpton, his first time over hurdles, I don't think there is massive improvement really. He ran well in his bumpers. We always thought he was a nice horse - Neil Mulholland, trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrow winner of his last two novices; needs further progress to defy this high a mark
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on his handicap debut but that was a strong race at Newbury and he's since won novices at Bangor (2m, soft) and Exeter (2m2f, good to soft), both by narrow margins having made all; needs further progress to defy this high a mark.
Horse quote: 2025-02-09 at Exeter (18.5f): "From three-out Excelero was very tough and it's one of his hallmarks. He stayed the trip well and it was a very gutsy and good performance. We didn't have the hood on last time as we didn't think we needed it, but over this trip we thought it was important he could relax enough to get home. I think it made the difference.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten by Elysian Knight in a novice last time and not weighted to reverse those placings
🔦 Spotlight: Back at 2m when beating five rivals for breakthrough success in a Newbury handicap (soft) but no match for Elysian Knight in a Fontwell novice last time (2m5f, good) and not weighted to reverse those placings.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Newbury (16.5f): "It all went wrong at Sandown the other day when we tried Authentic Legacy over two and a half miles. I put cheekpieces on him, but he was far too keen and the headgear overdid it. He always looks like he needs to go further, so you start to wonder if he's tripless. He's a chaser in the making and I do hold him in reasonable regard. He's got the size and scope, and he's very athletic, and he should take to a fence - Gary Moore, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner; he doesn't look ahead of his mark but he's not had a lot of racing
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 2m maiden on good ground here last May and ran another good race to be fourth on handicap debut at Windsor three months ago (2m4f, soft); he doesn't look ahead of his mark but he's not had a lot of racing.
