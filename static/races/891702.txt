🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Upped to 3m1f when suffering a heavy defeat in hat-trick bid; back down in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won over about 2m5f at Southwell (good) and Huntingdon (good to soft) in her first two handicaps, before a heavy defeat trying 3m1f; back down in trip, probably needing to resume improvement but she makes much more appeal than most of these.
Horse quote: 2025-01-02 at Huntingdon (20.5f): "Rockola will be going up to three miles as she did all her best work at the finish. These Jukebox Jurys are very game - Nick Brown, syndicate organiser."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Moves up in trip on handicap debut for top yard and needs a check for more market interest
🔦 Spotlight: Close second in a good-ground bumper for Nicky Henderson in May 2023 but was then off for 617 days; she hasn't shown much in her three hurdle races for this top yard (all in the mud; last of three on latest outing) but moves up in trip on handicap debut and needs a check for more market interest.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-17 under rules and refused to race when hooded three "starts" back but she is down the weights and, following wind surgery, was in serious contention when short of room and running out at the second last at Newton Abbot (2m6f, heavy) four days ago; some hope might be renewed.

💬 Comment: 4l Exeter win (2m2f) two runs ago; needs to resume progress but new trip is interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Held up and led run-in for 4l win at Exeter (2m2f, good) in March in her second handicap and that's nearly the furthest she's been; 6lb higher at Market Rasen (near 2m1f, good) 19 days later and disappointed in last of four; needs to resume progress but the new trip is interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled over hurdles and pulled up on chase debut; connections turn to headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Two bumper wins early in 2023 kicked off her career but she's struggled over hurdles and pulled up on recent chase debut; fourth run for this yard and they now turn to headgear.
Horse quote: 2023-01-07 at Newcastle (16.5f): "I thought Ici La Reine would run a bit greener than that, but Dylan (Kitts) gave her a lovely ride and he is a brilliant claimer who is a big part of the team. She'll improve markedly on the back of that - Warren Greatrex, trainer."
