💬 Comment: Improvement needed but the hood and longer trip are possible positives on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't achieved much in bumpers and novice/maiden hurdles (2m), and improvement is needed off his opening mark; however, his dam won at up to 2m4f and the first-time hood could help him settle now up in trip; not ruled out, and the betting may be informative.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has shown ability here but pulled up over C&D ten days ago on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Fair fifth in C&D maiden last June but well beaten in C&D novice (good to soft) this month after absence, and pulled up over C&D (good to soft) on handicap debut ten days ago; plenty to prove.
