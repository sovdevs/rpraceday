🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner; 2.25l runner up behind Port Joulain in a Gowran bumper in March 2024; fine effort on hurdles debut on return from over year off last month at Limerick (2m3f, soft) and form since boosted by the third; the one to beat stepping up in trip.

🔦 Spotlight: 91 rated five-time Flat winner in the UK including twice on turf; hasn't translated that ability to this sphere and his fourth on latest at Fairyhouse was a remote one; best form is on a sound surface and unsure this longer trip will suit but still has place claims in this company.
