💬 Comment: Underperformed when trying 1m2f on handicap debut last time, after a break; turf debut
🔦 Spotlight: All four starts have been on AW; won a Newcastle maiden (1m) in January from the front but she underperformed when trying 1m2f on handicap debut at Lingfield nearly three months later; early days.
Horse quote: 2025-01-11 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "Pacifist was very straightforward and galloped out all the way to the line. I think she could step up in trip going forward - Sean Bowen, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A whiff of ability, so he needs a second look on this switch of surface and to handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: Two runs on heavy here as 2yo and one on Kempton AW; ✂️ gelded since; late foal who's bred to stay at least this far; there's been a whiff of ability, so he needs a second look on this switch of surface and to handicaps.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: This will demand a fair bit more on first start since changing hands and leaving Ed Walker
🔦 Spotlight: Probably acts on good to firm; creditable fifth of 12 at Wolverhampton (8.6f, AW) in December last time, her second handicap; this race will demand a fair bit more on first start since changing hands and leaving Ed Walker.
