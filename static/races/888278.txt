💬 Comment: Off the mark over C&D on stable debut last time; up 5lb; conditions suit; should go well
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Mark Walford; having dropped to a good mark, got off the mark on 20th start over jumps when winning by 2.25l over C&D on stable debut two weeks ago (good to soft; Chestnut Pete last of six); 5lb higher here but should go well again.
