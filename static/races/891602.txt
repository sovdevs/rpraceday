🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor strike-rate for one with his ability but has looked in good heart; leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose performer who has a poor strike-rate for one with his ability, but he was a 1l second here (2m, good) on April 2 then faded when tackling 2m2f at Pontefract six days later; leading claims back down in trip.
Horse quote: 2024-05-02 at Punchestown (16.5f): "Pigeon House is entered on the Flat at Gowran next week and he will probably mix it. He had been threatening to do that all Winter and he liked that better ground - Jessica Harrington, trainer"

💬 Comment: Some fair AW efforts off his basement mark this spring and he might not be far away
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten on his last 13 starts and his drop to a basement mark has been for good reason; however, he's run some fair races on AW this spring and should be okay now back on turf; might not be far away.
Horse quote: 2024-04-08 at Newcastle (AW) (12.5f): "Yakhabar is generally held up but everything else in the race was held up also, so I thought we'd take a chance and go forward and I think that's what's won him the race - Liam Bailey, trainer."

💬 Comment: Fair fifth at Southwell last month but losing sequence goes back all the way to 2022
🔦 Spotlight: Went close at Newcastle (2m, AW) in January and returned to form with fair fifth at Southwell (2m, AW) last month; however, her losing sequence goes back all the way to September 2022 and others appeal more.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who displayed some ability over 7f for Jim Bolger in summer 2023 but well beaten on both runs last year (1m1f/1m2f), the latest her stable debut in September; lots to prove.
