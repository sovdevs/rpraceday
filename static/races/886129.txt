🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over C&D last time and could take 10lb rise in his stride, given his dominance
🔦 Spotlight: The form of his C&D second (good) in November worked out well and he won in fine style over C&D (good to soft) last time from Bentley's Return; 10lb higher but could take that in his stride, given his dominance.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 7yo who was an encouraging second on his chase and seasonal debut over C&D (good to soft) in December, albeit no match for the winner Theonlywayiswessex; disappointing at Wincanton (2m4f, good to soft) since but perhaps the first-time cheekpieces will prompt a return to form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Encouraging third over hurdles at Ffos Las last time; lightly raced 5yo now goes chasing
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two novice hurdles late last year (2m, good/good to soft; including here) and returned to form when third at Ffos Las (2m4f, soft) last month in his second handicap hurdle; connections waste little time in sending this lightly raced 5yo over fences and he's a possible 🚀 improver.
