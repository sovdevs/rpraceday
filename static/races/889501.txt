💬 Comment: Irish point winner two years ago; stable's bumper runners have gone well all season
🔦 Spotlight: It wasn't a strong Irish 3m point (good) that she won two years ago and she has been a good-while absent; however, her stable's bumper runners have been going well all season so she would be interesting if at all strong in the market.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point winner two years ago; stable's bumper runners have gone well all season
🔦 Spotlight: It wasn't a strong Irish 3m point (good) that she won two years ago and she has been a good-while absent; however, her stable's bumper runners have been going well all season so she would be interesting if at all strong in the market.
