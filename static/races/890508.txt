🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all to exploit much reduced mark at Wetherby last month; 4lb rise looks manageable
🔦 Spotlight: No longer the force of old but exploited some considerable help from the handicapper when making all for clearcut success at Wetherby (2m3f, good) last month; it's hard to tell whether he'll be in the same mood again but a 4lb rise ought to be manageable.
Horse quote: 2025-03-18 at Wetherby (19.5f): "Do Your Job has fallen a long way down the handicap. He had wind issues and problems, so it's nice to see him win again. He got a nice lead and the better ground helped - he was a very good horse on his day. Things haven't been straightforward, but it's nice to get him a win. He could win another race while the ground is quick - Charlie Longsdon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good second at Newcastle two starts ago but pulled up in his other two chases
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner (soft/good); left poor chasing debut behind when second at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft) in January, but was pulled up again on his latest outing and it's hard to know what to expect from him.
Horse quote: 2022-12-27 at Wetherby (16f): "We thought Quick Sharpener may have had a wind issue but we couldn't find anything wrong with him so the next thing to do was drop him back in trip as we wondered if he didn't stay - he looks like a three-miler and maybe he'd fooled us. He'll be a chaser, jumping is his best asset and that helped him out today - Dan Abraham, Foxtrot Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good second at Newcastle two starts ago but pulled up in his other two chases
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner (soft/good); left poor chasing debut behind when second at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft) in January, but was pulled up again on his latest outing and it's hard to know what to expect from him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Will find this easier than her first chasing assignment but still has a lot to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Won four times over hurdles (2m3f-2m4f) for Donald McCain in early part of this season but has struggled on all three starts for new stable since November; will find this easier than the Listed race she contested on last month's chasing debut but still has a lot to prove.
