🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fourth of 21 at Doncaster latest and has possibilities if he gets a good pace back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Most of his runs have been on AW and all three wins have been gained here (8.6f); last success was in September 2023 but that was off 8lb higher and he ran well to finish fourth of 21 at Doncaster (1m, good) last month; now drops back in trip in new headgear and he has possibilities if he gets a good pace to aim at.

🔦 Spotlight: On lengthy losing run and has had a few false dawns since November but he caught the eye with his late headway when third at Southwell (Tapeta; blinkers reapplied) last Sunday; that was an eyecatching effort over 6f and has claims if he can back that up.

🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row at Newcastle (6f/7f) last spring; 0-13 since but she's dropped down the weights and was a close second at Southwell (6f) last Sunday, on her first run after wind surgery; ties in closely with Swiss Ace on that form and she's respected back in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last win was over C&D and was a good third at Chelmsford last week; in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Mixed results since his C&D win in October but he's had a couple of close calls here since then and was a creditable third at Chelmsford last Friday; has good draw back at this track and he could have a big role to play.
Horse quote: 2022-08-16 at Chelmsford (AW) (7f): "It all happened a bit too quickly for Zu Run on his debut at Salisbury over the six furlongs. He missed the break and got unbalanced at times but I felt that he hit the line well enough for an extra furlong to help him and that's exactly what happened here. He showed a good attitude to the line and it's nice that he's taken a good step forward from that first experience - David Probert, jockey."

💬 Comment: On much lower mark on AW and was placed on recent Kempton reappearance; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: All eight wins have been on turf but he returned from a break with front-running third at Kempton (1m, Polytrack) 11 days ago; that was a good effort off his much lower AW mark and he's not ruled out back in trip.
