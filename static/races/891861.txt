🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Group 2 winner at two; promise over 7f on return; down in trip/class; serious contender
🔦 Spotlight: Useful 2yo, winning the Group 2 Duchess Of Cambridge at Newmarket (6f, good) and ending her juvenile campaign with a third in the Cheveley Park Stakes; shaped well in the Nell Gwyn on her return and dropping back in trip looks the right move; escapes a penalty for her Group-race win, has a pedigree full of AW winners and rates a strong contender from a handy draw.
Horse quote: 2025-04-15 at Newmarket (7f): "James Doyle [jockey] thought Arabian Dusk was going best at the Bushes but struggled up the hill. She'll probably drop back to six furlongs - Chris Wall, owner's racing manager."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Listed wins already, beating males at Cork latest (6f, good); AW winner; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Bath maiden (5.5f, good to firm) last June and she has added two Listed wins to her tally since, at Dundalk (5f, AW) last October and at Cork (6f, good) last month; beat male opposition for the latter success and there was a lot to like about the ease with which she made up her ground; this track doesn't always lend itself to such tactics but a good gallop would seem likely and she's done well to find a race where she escapes a penalty; good chance.
Horse quote: 2025-04-06 at Cork (6f): "Lady With The Lamp doesn't get any credit and was a giant price again today, but has beaten good fillies and colts. I know it wasn't her day as such, but she went off at a big price. She had done well physically and mentally and seems to be growing up. You'd love to think she could run in the Commonwealth Cup if you were going to go mad, but she has won two Listed races now - Kevin Blake, part owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Three 5f wins last year, notably Ayr Listed race; drawn wide on return; 6f still a query
🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each 2yo run, rounding off her campaign with a Listed success (5f, good) at Ayr's Western meeting; no problem with Polytrack but she has to prove herself over 6f and she has the widest stall to contend with on her return from 223 days off.
Horse quote: 2024-09-20 at Ayr (5f): "Star Of Mehmas broke nicely and went through the gears well. She's very straightforward and she was tough when I asked her to pick up. Mr Hughes said to have her in the first couple and see how she goes, she has a good cruising speed - Billy Loughnane, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice placed in Listed company as a 2yo; still 🔍 unexposed and AW should suit; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Came to hand early last season, winning at Salisbury last May (5f, soft) before a good third in Listed company at York's Dante meeting; absent for 168 days prior to another good third in Listed company at Newmarket (6f, good); 🔍 unexposed and AW shouldn't be a problem on breeding; shortlisted.
Horse quote: 2024-05-05 at Salisbury (5f): "It was very pleasing. We fancied Running Queen the first day at Newbury but it was a competitive race and she raced on the wing a bit. She seems to have come forward and she did it nicely. She's always stuck her head above the parapet and has come to hand early. She's always looked like an above-average filly, so it's nice to do it and it's for a new owner in the yard too. She'll hopefully have some nice targets throughout the year. I'm sure she'll get six furlongs no problem, but she's quick and we're happy for now keeping her over five - Ollie Sangster, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: The winner of two of her six starts in France, both on AW; only fourth at Chantilly in March and suspicion she'll need a jolt of improvement to take the prize back across the Channel.

💬 Comment: Has plenty to find on the figures but she's an improving, 🔍 unexposed filly from a good yard
🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each of her three 2yo runs, getting off the mark at Yarmouth when last seen in September; that form well short of what will be needed here but, as an 🔍 unexposed and well-related filly from a powerful stable, it would be foolish to think she couldn't do better.

💬 Comment: Three wins, including Listed, as a 2yo; needs to leave recent return well behind her
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins as a 2yo, notably a Newbury Listed in August (5f, good); highly tried afterwards and ran some good races on a range of ground; recent return to action at Bath (5f, good to firm; Listed) was low key though and she'll need to raise her game.
Horse quote: 2024-05-20 at Carlisle (5f): "Englemere is very tough. She fluffed her lines a little bit at the start but we went very quick and for a filly to win with a penalty takes a bit of doing. She's a nice filly - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: The highlight of her 2yo campaign came when seeing off 21 rivals to win a sales race at the Curragh in good style last September (6.5f, good); stretched by 7f on her reappearance; improvement is required to trouble a few of these.
Horse quote: 2024-09-15 at Curragh (6.5f): "Watching her videos and speaking to everyone involved Spirit D'Or is quite a forward-going filly. Going that last furlong was a little bit of an unknown but we thought if she did things right, she'd see it out - Ronan Whelan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten in two runs for new connections this year; looks up against it once more
🔦 Spotlight: Highly tried after her winning debut at Hamilton last summer (for Karl Burke) and came up short; neither start for her new connections this year suggests she's the answer here.
Horse quote: 2024-06-06 at Hamilton (6f): "Liberalised was impressive. She's been showing us all the right signs at home and she's the sort of filly who does everything so easily. You can never be sure first time out but Karl [Burke, trainer] has got a good gauge on his two-year-olds and she's bound to improve - Danny Tudhope, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten in three handicaps for new stable; accessories added today but hard to recommend
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Thirsk fillies' novice on her third and final start for Karl Burke last season; beaten in three handicaps for her 🆕 new yard this year and looks to face a hopeless task on these terms on all the available evidence; hood and tongue-tie now enlisted.
