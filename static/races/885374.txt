💬 Comment: Has delivered useful RPRs in winning his two bumpers; strong contender
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £110,000 after beating Great Fleet in an Irish point; the front two were clear when winning at Chepstow and he then defied a penalty with ease at Exeter (again soft), albeit at the expense of two outsiders; has delivered useful RPRs and looks a strong contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Defied odds of 80-1 when third in a valuable bumper at Punchestown last April and he looked as though he'd win that until fading late on (had raced keenly); there are mixed messages as to the strength of that form but he's open to any amount of improvement for Paul Nicholls.

💬 Comment: The form of his Plumpton win has worked out well; should have a bright future
🔦 Spotlight: First bumper run in Ireland was better than the second; has some scope though and the mare he edged out at Plumpton (good to soft) has gone on to win her next two, beating a subsequent winner before taking a Listed race at Market Rasen; looks to have a bright future.

🔦 Spotlight: Not easy to gauge what she achieved in winning a 1m6f bumper in France (very soft) but she won by the thick end of 10l and later changed hands for £155,000; the only mare in this field but she's clearly promising.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a 16-runner Listed bumper at Cheltenham (soft) by 2l but they went a steady pace and it didn't look that strong a race despite its status; will almost certainly need more here tackling older opposition.
