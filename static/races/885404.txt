💬 Comment: Third in a point and has joined a top trainer for his rules career; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Promising third on debut in Irish maiden point (3m, soft to heavy) last April and has joined a top trainer for his rules career; makes bumper debut in what looks a pretty warm race but he's not ruled out.

🔦 Spotlight: Beaten about 9l when eighth of 12 at 9-2 on debut at Warwick (2m, good to soft) in December; improvement needed but it's very early days for this 100,000euros purchase, who is in top hands; no surprise to see a good run.

🔦 Spotlight: Had wind surgery prior to his debut at Chepstow (2m, good to soft) in October, when tailed off at 80-1; has since had another wind operation and now goes without the hood; probably best watched.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close over C&D on New Year's Day and could again be in the shake-up
🔦 Spotlight: Held every chance when falling two out in his sole point (3m, yielding) and the form of his bumper debut fourth at Newton Abbot (2m1f, heavy) in October has worked out well; he's since gone close over this C&D (soft) and could again be in the shake-up.
