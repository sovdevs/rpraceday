🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bolted up in handicap at Beverley last week and could be tough to beat under 6lb penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Improved upon her four 2yo runs when upped in trip and easily winning a handicap at 18-1 at Beverley (1m2f, good) last Thursday on her handicap and turf debut; she needs to back up that performance but could be tough to beat under a 6lb penalty if reproducing the form.

🔦 Spotlight: Below par on reappearance in Musselburgh maiden four weeks ago (1m, good; having been ✂️ gelded) but he stayed on well for third in a Newcastle novice (1m, AW) last November and it will be no surprise if this 150,000gns yearling takes a big step forward now up in trip on his handicap debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each of his three 2yo runs for Ed Bethell, going close at Beverley (8.4f, good) in September when last seen; sold for 35,000gns in October and ✂️ gelded since; makes handicap debut with 🆕 new yard in fine form and he's bred to be suited by the step up in trip; could have a big say.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has shown ability; pedigree suggests handicap debut trip will suit but he might pull hard
🔦 Spotlight: Made debut in January; fair efforts over 1m on first two starts (faded) and beaten just a short head at Brighton (6f, good to firm) last time; his pedigree provides optimism regarding the suitability of this different trip on his handicap debut, but there's a concern that he'll pull hard.

💬 Comment: Not obviously well treated off opening mark but he's a brother to two winners
🔦 Spotlight: He's not obviously well treated judged on what he showed in three novices races last October (1m-1m1f) on soft/heavy ground; however, this brother to two winners has been ✂️ gelded since and could be capable of better; one to watch in the betting on handicap/seasonal debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Cheekpieces were applied for the switch to handicaps and he showed improved form, winning at Southwell (1m, AW) in March; he shouldn't be written off but he was only sixth back at Southwell (1m, AW) last time and goes without headgear today.
