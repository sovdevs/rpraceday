🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 2 winner at last season's Festival and now returns to what looks her best trip
🔦 Spotlight: The highlight of last season's unbeaten campaign was taking the notable scalp of Brighterdaysahead in the Grade 2 Mares' Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival; signed off with a 2m4f win there in April but that was very winnable and she's looked a non-stayer over similar distances this season in better races; back over shorter and in receipt of weight from all her rivals, she's a player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grossly flattered to be 3l off Constitution Hill latest; consistent but may come up short
🔦 Spotlight: Ran poorly in a handicap two runs back but consistent otherwise and ran well in the Grade 2 Elite Hurdle here in November on ground that was not soft enough ideally; cheekpieces were added last time at Cheltenham (Grade 2, soft) and debatable what he acheived in finishing best of the rest behind easy winner Constitution Hill; can make his presence felt but may come up short.
