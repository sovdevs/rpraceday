🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Thriving 4yo who has won his last three (including C&D); latest 3lb rise may not stop him
🔦 Spotlight: Has won at different AW tracks on his last three starts, over C&D on the middle occasion; this thriving 4yo did it nicely at Kempton last time and a 3lb rise may not prevent the four-timer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very useful jumper who could relish the step up in trip on Flat handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who was slowly away and failed to threaten last year on his first three Flat starts (1m4f/1m, twice here); however, he still showed some promise and this very useful jumper could relish the step up in trip on his Flat handicap debut; has plenty of potential off his opening mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Prematurely eased when short-headed here this month; refused to race next time
🔦 Spotlight: Prematurely eased when beaten a short head here (1m6f) this month; stays this trip and shouldn't be ruled out but he refused to race at Chelmsford nine days ago and he did the same thing twice in a row in autumn 2023, so comes with risks attached.
