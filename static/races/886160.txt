💬 Comment: Went down by a narrow margin last time and has to be feared off just 3lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins came at Perth during the autumn of 2023; beaten 18l into second at Sedgefield on Boxing Day but went down by only a head at Newcastle last month (2m4f, good to soft) and has to be feared off just 3lb higher.
