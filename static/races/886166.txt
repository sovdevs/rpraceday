🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-3 for Will Biddick including an easy win on heavy at Wincanton last month; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Useful for Paul Nicholls, finishing third behind Constitution Hill in the Grade 1 Tolworth three years ago; unbeaten in three runs for Will Biddick in the last 13 months, with the first two in points and the latest an easy win in hunter chase at Wincanton (3m1f, heavy) two weeks ago; has a penalty in this deeper race but he's still 🔍 unexposed over regulation fences and should have more to offer in this sphere; 🔥 big player.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins from five starts over hurdles and he made it 2-2 in points when making all at Larkhill (3m) on his comeback in December; had tough task in Grade 2 on only previous run over regulation fences and he's respected on this hunter chase debut; his three rules wins have been on good to soft/soft.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5-8 in points and was creditable third in a good race at Warwick last month; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: 7yo with a record of 5-8 in points; turned over as favourite in his two runs in hunter chases but he was only beaten 2l in a good race at Warwick (3m, good to soft) last month, when a mistake at the third-last fence didn't help; that form puts him firmly in the picture and he still has potential.

💬 Comment: 3-3 for Will Biddick including an easy win on heavy at Wincanton last month; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Useful for Paul Nicholls, finishing third behind Constitution Hill in the Grade 1 Tolworth three years ago; unbeaten in three runs for Will Biddick in the last 13 months, with the first two in points and the latest an easy win in hunter chase at Wincanton (3m1f, heavy) two weeks ago; has a penalty in this deeper race but he's still 🔍 unexposed over regulation fences and should have more to offer in this sphere; 🔥 big player.

💬 Comment: 5-8 in points and was creditable third in a good race at Warwick last month; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: 7yo with a record of 5-8 in points; turned over as favourite in his two runs in hunter chases but he was only beaten 2l in a good race at Warwick (3m, good to soft) last month, when a mistake at the third-last fence didn't help; that form puts him firmly in the picture and he still has potential.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairly useful for W Mullins and he won a point in November; respected back under rules
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful over hurdles and fences for Willie Mullins; emphatic winner of a point (3m, good to soft) in November and he's finished runner-up in that sphere in last two runs; now returns to rules and he's a key player on his best chase form last season.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5-8 in points and was creditable third in a good race at Warwick last month; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: 7yo with a record of 5-8 in points; turned over as favourite in his two runs in hunter chases but he was only beaten 2l in a good race at Warwick (3m, good to soft) last month, when a mistake at the third-last fence didn't help; that form puts him firmly in the picture and he still has potential.
