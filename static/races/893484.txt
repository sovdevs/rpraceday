🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole win on AW at 2m, best turf effort over C&D on yielding, may need better ground
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; sole win in either code came on the AW over 2m on his last Flat start; 0-7 on turf on the Flat but his best effort came over C&D (yielding); has mostly struggled on testing ground and well beaten on soft over hurdles latest.
Horse quote: 2025-01-17 at Dundalk (AW) (16f): "Elle Dorado Rock was suited when they started to race halfway down the back and he was able to pick them off. He really needs a couple of furlongs extra - Robbie Colgan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual-purpose, has won on heavy, shaped well last flat start on AW (2m), not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose hurdles winner is 1-14 on turf on the Flat; shaped well on latest start in this sphere on the AW at Dundalk (2m) in December; off since respectable hurdles run at Cork in January; has won on heavy and ran okay over 1m on only previous visit to this track; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2024-09-23 at Sedgefield (17f): "Dumb Love is rated 60-odd on the Flat and runs over a mile and a quarter, so I knew she'd have the pace. A good friend of mine works for Ger, so he told me all about her. He said 'don't be hanging around, drive her on from the top of the hill' and he was right - Brian Hughes, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: 0-17 on turf, good effort over timber here latest, likes heavy ground, chance; cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Hurdles winner is 0-17 on turf on the Flat; solid effort after a break here on latest in a 2m handicap hurdle on soft; likes testing ground and she's 7lb lower than when beaten 10.5l into fifth of 14 on her last Flat start at Limerick; claims in first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-01-30 at Limerick (16f): "She worked very well during the week and loves soft ground so  we thought Brilliant Question had a good chance. I was meant to jump off last but she was a bit keen in my hands, but she went to the line strongly - Robbie Geoghegan, rider, talking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual-purpose, no Flat win since October 2022, out of form over hurdles, others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; two-time hurdles winner is 2-12 on the Flat; last win in this sphere on soft at Killarney off 56 in October 2022; out of form over jumps recently and remains 3lb above his last win; others appeal more.
Horse quote: 2023-12-29 at Limerick (16f): "Your Honor was so impressive when he won here on similar ground, and it was a fairly obvious move to come back here. He jumps so well and he seems to want genuinely heavy ground. I suppose we will have to go the spring festivals - James Nash, trainer"
