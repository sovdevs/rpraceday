🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Frustrating to follow and came down when beaten here last time; has ability but risky
🔦 Spotlight: Has become frustrating to follow; hit the crossbar in his first five starts and lesser efforts in two recent runs, finishing well held at Leopardstown on St Stephen's Day before coming down when beaten in a maiden hurdle here last month; has the ability to land a maiden hurdle but he's risky.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Encouraging debut despite errors and two good runs in defeat twice since; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Encouraging debut despite making errors in a Punchestown maiden hurdle in December 2023 before hitting the frame in a Listed bumper at Limerick in March; another good run when beaten roughly 2l on his Roscommon return in September and will be a 🔥 big player if he comes on for that.
