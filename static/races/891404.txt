🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Breeders' Cup Juvenile hero after a couple of high-profile lapses, can make his class tell
🔦 Spotlight: Beat subsequent Group 1 winners Hotazhell and Scorthy Champ in Group 2 Futurity at the Curragh; looked an awkward ride when failing to uphold form with Scorthy Champ in National Stakes; probably unsuited by soft ground when below form in Prix Jean-Luc Legardere; came good in style over 1m on quick ground at the Breeders' Cup.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Top-class juvenile sprinter, warmed up at Dundalk, big threat to Henri Matisse if he stays
🔦 Spotlight: Talented juvenile sprinter last year, winning the Group 3 Marble Hill Stakes at the Curragh and twice placed at top level, notably when second to fellow Irish raider Magnum Force at the Breeders' Cup on final start; warmed up for this with a comfortable odds-on win at Dundalk; a major threat to Henri Matisse if he stays.
