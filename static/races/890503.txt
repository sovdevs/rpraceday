🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in Punchestown novice last time; the return to left-handed track could be a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Point, bumper and maiden hurdle winner who, minus his usual hood (same today), showed improved form when second in a novice chase at Punchestown in February on his third run over fences; the return to a left-handed track could be a plus and he's very much respected for his top Irish trainer.
Horse quote: 2024-01-27 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Western Diego was good and did it well. He's a keen-going sort and he would have improved plenty for his first run. Brian said he was still gnawing at him there, but he did it well. He won a 2m3f bumper so he was always going to stay but, if he just helps himself, he'll stay better. He did settle better today with the run under his belt. He's going the right direction anyway - David Casey, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: 10yo who won this last year off a 1lb higher mark and could have a part to play
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who won this last year (soft) off a 1lb higher mark; has also won on good ground; fair efforts on first three starts this season and he wasn't without a chance when unseating three out at Aintree (2m, good to soft) nine days ago; could have a part to play.
Horse quote: 2024-04-20 at Ayr (16.5f): "It's quite an occasion, beating all these top horses from the south and Ireland. It was a great performance. My wife made me drive 725 miles because Tommy's Oscar just doesn't settle if we stop overnight. Last time at Doncaster he jumped to the right too much but we knew he would go well because he's fresh again. Everywhere we go he has 12st but he carries it very well, it's amazing how he does because he's a light-framed horse - Ian Hamilton, owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Close third in February and wind op since last run, but has had very patchy campaign
🔦 Spotlight: Completed soft-ground hat-trick in winter 2023-24 and returned to form with close third at Sandown (1m7f, heavy) in February; has had wind op since being pulled up at Kempton (2m4f, good to soft) last time but it's been a very patchy campaign and it's possible he's best served by soft/heavy going.
Horse quote: 2024-02-15 at Sandown (15.5f): "Etalon pulled a muscle right at the start of the season, so we just gave him a bit of time and he's come good. He was always going to improve for a fence and you can ride him any way and on most ground. Now we've given him that time he's very straightforward. We ran him in the EBF Final last season and while he did stay two and a half miles he's more of a two miler and will stay at that for now. I should think we'll go to Aintree for the Grade 1 race [Maghull Novices' Chase] -"

🔦 Spotlight: Won over hurdles at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) in December and good second over fences there (2m, good) last month behind one who was runner-up in a Grade 1 novice at Aintree next time; that's the only previous occasion he's worn these blinkers; fair second over hurdles at Bangor (2m3f, good) last time; 3-8 over fences and could have more to offer now back chasing.
Horse quote: 2024-12-13 at Doncaster (19.5f): "I have massive admiration for Homme Public. He's an absolute gent to do anything with. He's run in plenty of big races and is maybe just shy of being a really good horse, but what he loses in that little bit of ability for the top end he makes up for with his attitude. He's really there when you need him and is a pleasure to ride - Henry Brooke, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up on latest chase start behind one who finished second in a Grade 1 next time
🔦 Spotlight: Won over hurdles at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) in December and good second over fences there (2m, good) last month behind one who was runner-up in a Grade 1 novice at Aintree next time; that's the only previous occasion he's worn these blinkers; fair second over hurdles at Bangor (2m3f, good) last time; 3-8 over fences and could have more to offer now back chasing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good record in this race; step back in right direction last time; this 10yo needs another
🔦 Spotlight: Went close in this in 2022 (good to soft) and won it in 2023 (good; off 10lb higher); 0-10 since; not beaten far at Kelso (2m1f, good) last October and last month's sixth at Doncaster (2m, good) was a step back in the right direction, but this 11yo needs another today in first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2023-04-22 at Ayr (16.5f): "I couldn't explain Cheltenham. Malystic travelled well and he just never picked up, it may have been the ground. Apart from that he's been grand and that's the third big handicap he's won this season. That will be it for this season - Peter Niven, trainer."
