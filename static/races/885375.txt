💬 Comment: Has made a cracking transition to chasing; hurdles mark went up in tandem, but a player
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in the mud as a staying novice hurdler last spring and has made a cracking transition to chasing this season, with handicap wins on better ground at Aintree and Cheltenham on last two starts; now has Grade 1 novice chase entry at Cheltenham; hurdles mark has gone up in tandem, so there is a bit more to prove back in this sphere but recent credentials still look stronger than most of these.

💬 Comment: Ffos Las (3m, soft) latest saw a first win since 2021; raced on inner and now back up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Frequently competitive but Ffos Las (3m, soft) four weeks ago was his first actual win since December 2021; he raced apart (on the inner) from the others for much of that race, which may have played some role, and has also now gone back up 6lb, so there's more work to be done this time.

💬 Comment: Two creditable places over extended 2m7f in the mud but needs to see it out a bit better
🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts under Freddie Gingell, including when runaway winner over 2m5f here last March; tried an extended 2m7f in the mud at Uttoxeter on two of his three starts since and ran creditably to be placed, but he can race a bit freely and looked the winner two out on latest start (finished a close third) so he needs to see it out a bit better.

🔦 Spotlight: Always ridden these days by Ben Sutton; regular improvement has brought five handicap wins (latest last March) and he was a good second at Hereford on latest outing; those were over 2m3f-2m5f but he was also a close third in April 2023 on one of his two attempts at 3m under rules and could be worth another attempt.

💬 Comment: Always behind at 80-1 after a long layoff; stamina to prove too but he needs a second look
🔦 Spotlight: Tended to race freely two seasons back and had plenty to learn before he easily made all in a handicap at Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft; up 7lb today) that April, with a change of tactics; missed last season and always behind at 80-1 when he reappeared here ten weeks ago, with stamina to prove at 3m too, but there's a big feeling of unfinished business with him and he needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: Seven hurdle wins, all on good ground but similar form in the odd run on soft; returned from a long absence with three very unconvincing chase runs in August-October and two hurdle races this winter (tongue-tie) have been poor; dropped 12lb from his peak mark but he's been under a major cloud.

💬 Comment: Has made a cracking transition to chasing; hurdles mark went up in tandem, but a player
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in the mud as a staying novice hurdler last spring and has made a cracking transition to chasing this season, with handicap wins on better ground at Aintree and Cheltenham on last two starts; now has Grade 1 novice chase entry at Cheltenham; hurdles mark has gone up in tandem, so there is a bit more to prove back in this sphere but recent credentials still look stronger than most of these.

🔦 Spotlight: Frequently competitive but Ffos Las (3m, soft) four weeks ago was his first actual win since December 2021; he raced apart (on the inner) from the others for much of that race, which may have played some role, and has also now gone back up 6lb, so there's more work to be done this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Always ridden these days by Ben Sutton; regular improvement has brought five handicap wins (latest last March) and he was a good second at Hereford on latest outing; those were over 2m3f-2m5f but he was also a close third in April 2023 on one of his two attempts at 3m under rules and could be worth another attempt.

🔦 Spotlight: Tended to race freely two seasons back and had plenty to learn before he easily made all in a handicap at Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft; up 7lb today) that April, with a change of tactics; missed last season and always behind at 80-1 when he reappeared here ten weeks ago, with stamina to prove at 3m too, but there's a big feeling of unfinished business with him and he needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts under Freddie Gingell, including when runaway winner over 2m5f here last March; tried an extended 2m7f in the mud at Uttoxeter on two of his three starts since and ran creditably to be placed, but he can race a bit freely and looked the winner two out on latest start (finished a close third) so he needs to see it out a bit better.

🏠 Owner: Mrs Johnny De La Hey
💬 Comment: Always behind at 80-1 after a long layoff; stamina to prove too but he needs a second look
🔦 Spotlight: Tended to race freely two seasons back and had plenty to learn before he easily made all in a handicap at Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft; up 7lb today) that April, with a change of tactics; missed last season and always behind at 80-1 when he reappeared here ten weeks ago, with stamina to prove at 3m too, but there's a big feeling of unfinished business with him and he needs a second look.
