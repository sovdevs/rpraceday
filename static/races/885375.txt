💬 Comment: Has made a cracking transition to chasing; hurdles mark went up in tandem, but a player
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in the mud as a staying novice hurdler last spring and has made a cracking transition to chasing this season, with handicap wins on better ground at Aintree and Cheltenham on last two starts; now has Grade 1 novice chase entry at Cheltenham; hurdles mark has gone up in tandem, so there is a bit more to prove back in this sphere but recent credentials still look stronger than most of these.

💬 Comment: Ffos Las (3m, soft) latest saw a first win since 2021; raced on inner and now back up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Frequently competitive but Ffos Las (3m, soft) four weeks ago was his first actual win since December 2021; he raced apart (on the inner) from the others for much of that race, which may have played some role, and has also now gone back up 6lb, so there's more work to be done this time.

💬 Comment: Two creditable places over extended 2m7f in the mud but needs to see it out a bit better
🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts under Freddie Gingell, including when runaway winner over 2m5f here last March; tried an extended 2m7f in the mud at Uttoxeter on two of his three starts since and ran creditably to be placed, but he can race a bit freely and looked the winner two out on latest start (finished a close third) so he needs to see it out a bit better.

🔦 Spotlight: Won twice late in 2022 and reappeared at Fontwell (extended 3m2f, soft) six weeks ago to complete his hat-trick, with tongue tied first time and drawing 11l clear from two out; up 8lb and in grade, for second run since a long layoff, but there was plenty to like about that latest performance.

🔦 Spotlight: Pulled it out of the fire when winning under 7lb claimer at Taunton (3m, good to soft) in December; best results last term were on soft (unraced on heavy) but he was readily left adrift from three out when below-form fourth at Haydock three weeks ago; player on the earlier evidence.

🔦 Spotlight: Always ridden these days by Ben Sutton; regular improvement has brought five handicap wins (latest last March) and he was a good second at Hereford on latest outing; those were over 2m3f-2m5f but he was also a close third in April 2023 on one of his two attempts at 3m under rules and could be worth another attempt.

💬 Comment: Always behind at 80-1 after a long layoff; stamina to prove too but he needs a second look
🔦 Spotlight: Tended to race freely two seasons back and had plenty to learn before he easily made all in a handicap at Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft; up 7lb today) that April, with a change of tactics; missed last season and always behind at 80-1 when he reappeared here ten weeks ago, with stamina to prove at 3m too, but there's a big feeling of unfinished business with him and he needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: Has flattered to deceive over fences (1-12) and jumping mistakes played a part; a bit below his best on his two completions this autumn/winter and has now left Dan Skelton; blinkers replace his usual cheekpieces for this first hurdle race since March 2023; well handicapped judged on best efforts but he's now a 10yo.

🔦 Spotlight: Seven hurdle wins, all on good ground but similar form in the odd run on soft; returned from a long absence with three very unconvincing chase runs in August-October and two hurdle races this winter (tongue-tie) have been poor; dropped 12lb from his peak mark but he's been under a major cloud.

💬 Comment: Has made a cracking transition to chasing; hurdles mark went up in tandem, but a player
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in the mud as a staying novice hurdler last spring and has made a cracking transition to chasing this season, with handicap wins on better ground at Aintree and Cheltenham on last two starts; now has Grade 1 novice chase entry at Cheltenham; hurdles mark has gone up in tandem, so there is a bit more to prove back in this sphere but recent credentials still look stronger than most of these.

💬 Comment: Ffos Las (3m, soft) latest saw a first win since 2021; raced on inner and now back up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: Frequently competitive but Ffos Las (3m, soft) four weeks ago was his first actual win since December 2021; he raced apart (on the inner) from the others for much of that race, which may have played some role, and has also now gone back up 6lb, so there's more work to be done this time.

💬 Comment: Below-form fourth at Haydock three weeks ago but he's a player on the earlier evidence
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled it out of the fire when winning under 7lb claimer at Taunton (3m, good to soft) in December; best results last term were on soft (unraced on heavy) but he was readily left adrift from three out when below-form fourth at Haydock three weeks ago; player on the earlier evidence.

🔦 Spotlight: Always ridden these days by Ben Sutton; regular improvement has brought five handicap wins (latest last March) and he was a good second at Hereford on latest outing; those were over 2m3f-2m5f but he was also a close third in April 2023 on one of his two attempts at 3m under rules and could be worth another attempt.

💬 Comment: Always behind at 80-1 after a long layoff; stamina to prove too but he needs a second look
🔦 Spotlight: Tended to race freely two seasons back and had plenty to learn before he easily made all in a handicap at Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft; up 7lb today) that April, with a change of tactics; missed last season and always behind at 80-1 when he reappeared here ten weeks ago, with stamina to prove at 3m too, but there's a big feeling of unfinished business with him and he needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts under Freddie Gingell, including when runaway winner over 2m5f here last March; tried an extended 2m7f in the mud at Uttoxeter on two of his three starts since and ran creditably to be placed, but he can race a bit freely and looked the winner two out on latest start (finished a close third) so he needs to see it out a bit better.

💬 Comment: Always behind at 80-1 after a long layoff; stamina to prove too but he needs a second look
🔦 Spotlight: Tended to race freely two seasons back and had plenty to learn before he easily made all in a handicap at Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft; up 7lb today) that April, with a change of tactics; missed last season and always behind at 80-1 when he reappeared here ten weeks ago, with stamina to prove at 3m too, but there's a big feeling of unfinished business with him and he needs a second look.
