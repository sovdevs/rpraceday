🔦 Spotlight: Twice-raced filly who was a promising third in Hereford novice (2m, good to soft) in February and she finished second at Sedgefield (2m1f, good) three weeks ago; shaped as though this stiffer stamina test would suit last time and she's an interesting contender on handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner but she needs to kick on again to defy this mark on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner who sprang a surprise in four-runner novice here (good to firm; 18-1) in November but she was well held on return visit two weeks later; still 🔍 unexposed and now goes handicapping after a break but she needs more improvement at this new trip.
Horse quote: 2024-11-14 at Taunton (16.5f): "Jukebox Annie was probably just short of a bit of work. She had a longer summer off than I planned but it strengthened her up and it's done her good. Just the four runners helped as she's not getting baffled and bumped around. Hopefully there's a bit more in the tank - Claire Hitch, trainer, talking to Racing TV."
