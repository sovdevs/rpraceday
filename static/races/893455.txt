🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Enhanced his reputation with a fine second in the Ryanair, suited by the race conditions
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Corbetts Cross readily in a three-runner Listed chase at Wexford (2m7f, soft) on reappearance in October; just denied by Croke Park in a tight finish to the Drinmore over C&D on his final novice outing; faded into fourth in Savills Chase at Leopardstown; enhanced his reputation with a fine second to Fact To File in the Ryanair; suited by the race conditions.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (20.5f): "Heart Wood ran a cracker and he is only a baby and he is coming along really nicely. It was a really good race, and they went a savage pace, and the winner is obviously very good. I think this is the right trip for Heart Wood as I've tried him over three miles a couple of times and he just wasn't getting home, however he is only seven so we will see - Henry De Bromhead, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 5-10 over fences, concerning that his last two races have blotted his fine overall record
🔦 Spotlight: 5-10 over fences, runner-up on three occasions, all at Grade 1 level; concerning that his last two races have blotted his fine record; had an excuse at the DRF (nasal discharge), ran out of steam from the last in the Champion Chase; only previous run over this trip was when second here in the 2023 Drinmore; won over a shade shorter at Down Royal last November.
Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Navan (16f): "Jack said Found A Fifty didn't feel as good today as when he last rode him. He thought down the back he was going flat out, then he probably made up too much ground from the fifth-last to the third-last. He just stopped in front. But that was a fair performance and he's a smart horse. He won't run in the John Durkan, I would say we'll go to Leopardstown at Christmas for the 2m1f Grade 1 and work from there - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6-14 over fences, has been alternating between hurdles and chases, often races too keenly
🔦 Spotlight: Front runner; 6-14 over fences; has alternated between hurdling and chasing since being pulled up in this race last season, winning over timber at Cork and Auteuil and adding a Clonmel Grade 2 Chase (2m5f, good) in November; has often raced too keenly, including when beaten at odds-on by a stablemate at Gowran in February.
Horse quote: 2024-11-07 at Clonmel (21f): "Saint Sam is a hardy bit of stuff and has his own way of doing it but he's been a great servant. You're a passenger on him and all you do is steer him. He's so hard on himself but there's still fire in his belly. He's a big, strong horse and if he makes a mistake, he just gallops away off the back of the fence - Paul Townend, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needed the race when beaten by two stablemates in a Grade 2 event at Thurles in January
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 3 winner at Navan last term; beaten favourite in Grade 1 won by Spillane's Tower here last Easter and was pulled up (coughed post-race) at the Punchestown festival; probably needed the race when beaten by two stablemates in a Grade 2 event at Thurles in January.
Horse quote: 2024-03-02 at Navan (16f): "We tried new tactics and I thought that might be a help after Punchestown. Paul [Townend] was very taken with Blood Destiny there. He's brilliant to jump, that was always his feature, but we were making too much use of his jumping instead of just using it when we needed it. Coming back in trip might have been a help as well. I don't know whether we've made a mistake now leaving him at home for Cheltenham but at least he has one nice prize in the bag. I imagine he'll probably go for the WillowWarm Gold Cup at Fairyhouse. That was the plan, here and then on to that - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Most recent of three chase wins came in this race last year on heavy, weak form this term
🔦 Spotlight: Most recent of three chase wins came in this race last season on heavy ground, beating Appreciate It by 9l; nowhere near that level of form in three starts this season; beaten 44l at Windsor in January; 13l behind Saint Sam when last of three in the Red Mills at Gowran.
Horse quote: 2022-12-20 at Naas (20f): "We were a bit sketchy over the last but Journey With Me did it well. His jumping took a little bit of time to warm up, maybe after the fall the last day, but a great performance. He settled well, I didn't think we were going a mad gallop but we did all finish pretty tired so maybe it's tougher ground than it looks - Rachael Blackmore, jockey, talking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Career-highlight in winning 2023 Galway Plate, out of form since Killarney win last May
🔦 Spotlight: Seven-time chase winner; career-highlight in winning the 2023 Galway Plate; not at his best since Grade 3 Killarney win last May; reportedly bled at Gowran in October before being given a winter break; big price when unseating at the 11th (Foinavon) in the Topham.
Horse quote: 2024-05-13 at Killarney (20.5f): "Ash Tree Meadow did it very well, travelled well and jumped brilliant. Two miles was too sharp for him the last day but he went well on that ground today and his jumping was exceptional - Sam Ewing, rider."

💬 Comment: Only mild encouragement from last month's third over hurdles at Thurles, stable outsider
🔦 Spotlight: Has run only five times since a runaway Punchestown festival handicap chase success in 2023; failed to beat a single opponent in his two races this season; only mild encouragement from last month's third over hurdles at Thurles.
Horse quote: 2023-04-28 at Punchestown (21f): "Kilcruit was very good and the dry ground was a big help to him. He was probably a Graded horse in a handicap. He jumps for fun and Paul said he was in control at all times. We might look at the Galway Plate, you'd imagine that would be the ideal race to look at - David Casey, trainer's assistant."

Horse quote: 2023-02-26 at Naas (16f): "Rebel Gold didn't have to make all the running today which was a big help to him. I would have been more confident had the ground been soft, but he was fine on it and we will probably head now for the Grade 2 at Fairyhouse - Pat Foley, trainer"
