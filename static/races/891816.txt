🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in two turf maidens last summer; a player if ready to roll after six months off
🔦 Spotlight: Useful form in a couple of turf maidens last summer, especially when beaten a neck at Nottingham (6f, good to firm); found the trip too sharp at Southwell (5f, Tapeta) in October, but a player back over this distance if ready to roll after six months off.

🔦 Spotlight: Beaten only half a length on her debut for Ger Lyons at Naas (5f, good) last July, but regressed in her next two starts, the latest at Dundalk (5f, Polytrack) in November; makes her stable debut (same owners) after six months off and the market should be revealing.
