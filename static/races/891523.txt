🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Juvenile campaign featured a turf win and three third-place finishes on AW
🔦 Spotlight: Juvenile campaign featured a 7f maiden success on turf and three third-place finishes in 6f handicaps on AW; each-way possibilities, provided he returns in similar form.
Horse quote: 2024-07-24 at Catterick (7f): "Chuti Manika's first run, he got a bit lonely out in front and got caught close home. He was very professional through the race today - Charlie Johnston, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Has failed to repeat the form of York win; had wind surgery since last run
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning handicap debut in York event (6f, good to soft) last July but failed to repeat the form subsequently; chance hinges on physical tweak (had wind surgery over the winter).
Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at York (6f): "East Tyrone ran a great race on debut. Beverley was a run too quick after that but he's shown what he's capable of. We've always liked him. There's more to come and he'll improve with racing - Adam Ryan, assistant trainer."
