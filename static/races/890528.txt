🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up final run for Olly Murphy; also pulled up four times in points subsequently
🔦 Spotlight: A three-time scorer around 2m2f (including over fences) last season but he was pulled up here on his final run for Olly Murphy and has also been pulled up four times in points subsequently; he's very hard to make a case for.
