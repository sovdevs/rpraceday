💬 Comment: Third at Leopardstown before being just denied at Wexford, both over 2m; trip should suit
🔦 Spotlight: Flat winner is starting to find his feet in handicap hurdles; was a solid third at Leopardstown before being just denied at Wexford, both over 2m; this longer trip should suit and can go well up 4lb.
Horse quote: 2022-09-07 at Cork (7f): "Imadpour did that well. He handled the ground well but probably got there a bit soon. He will improve with time - Ronan Whelan, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second back at Fairyhouse on recent comeback; can come on from that and go well up 3lb
🔦 Spotlight: Flat winner won over hurdles at Fairyhouse last October; had a blip at Navan after but a decent second back at Fairyhouse on recent comeback; can come on from that and go well up 3lb.
Horse quote: 2024-10-12 at Fairyhouse (16f): "It was Cleopatra's Needle's first run in a handicap and Sean was very good on her. He put her to sleep and was the last one to get into it. She's not a bad filly and she likes jumping. She showed a bit early on on the Flat and she was unlucky not to win three in a row. Then things just went wrong with her, she's a hard mare to keep right - Harry Rogers, trainer."
