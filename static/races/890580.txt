🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two course wins make him the pick on form; rider's claim helps offset his double penalty
🔦 Spotlight: French 2m4f chase winner in 2024; now in a good vein of form over hurdles, winning two novices here (2m1f, good/good to soft) in March; that looks the best form on offer and Dominic Hislop's claim helps offset the double penalty; leading contender.
Horse quote: 2025-03-23 at Carlisle (17f): "That was obviously his race to lose. Bel Amigo was very impressive when he won a claiming chase in France and was very disappointing in his first two starts for us but it was obviously his wind. That's two runs in 14 days so we'll let him catch his breath and we may find something for him at Perth - Nick Alexander, trainer."

💬 Comment: Winning hurdling debut at Market Rasen; jumped soundly in main and is open to improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced in bumpers but off the mark immediately over hurdles at Market Rasen (2m4f, good; 20-1) last month, making all under Brian Hughes; that form might not have much depth but he jumped soundly in the main and is open to improvement.
