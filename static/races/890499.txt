💬 Comment: Ran on well for clear win at Chepstow last month and is now 2-6 over fences; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Ran on well for clearcut success at Chepstow (2m, good) last month and is now 2-6 over fences; recent 6lb rise makes things tougher but he remains 🔍 unexposed on decent ground and may still have a bigger run in him; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-03-16 at Chepstow (16f): "We were utilising Torneo's weight-for-age allowance earlier on in the season. That's run out now so he didn't have the benefit of that, but he's still done it very nicely - Jamie Snowden, trainer."

💬 Comment: Spoiled chance by racing too freely last time but has generally done well over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten after racing too freely at Kempton last month but has generally done well since switched to fences in the autumn; now back on same mark as for creditable second in stronger race than this at Kempton (2m4f, good) on Boxing Day and today's drop back in trip could be the right move; good chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner in February; rather laboured last time but new cheekpieces might perk him up
🔦 Spotlight: Won by 7l over C&D (good to soft) in February, his second chase run, and his subsequent second of three here (heavy) was perfectly respectable; rather laboured when well-held third here last month but has possibilities today if the first-time cheekpieces keep him focused.
