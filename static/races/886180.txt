🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Wetherby before close second at Newcastle and this could be a good opportunity
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wetherby (2m, good to soft) in December and went very close at Newcastle (2m4f, soft) last time; even with the penalty and the drop back in trip, this could be a good opportunity to return to winning ways.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed on both French starts, most recently third on hurdle debut at Auteuil (2m2f, heavy) in October; changed hands for 150,000euros in November and this 4yo is one to be interesting in on his British debut, especially if strong in the betting.

💬 Comment: Two-time bumper runner-up; improvement needed on second hurdle start but that's possible
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in two strong bumpers then tailed off at Punchestown festival last May; a bit underwhelming on hurdle debut over C&D in November but he's with a top trainer and could leave that latest run well behind.

🔦 Spotlight: His dam was useful and it's very early days, but he was soundly beaten in his sole bumper (good to soft) and it was the same story on last month's hurdle debut at Leicester (1m7f, heavy); lots of improvement needed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His dam was useful but he's been soundly beaten on both starts; lots of improvement needed
🔦 Spotlight: His dam was useful and it's very early days, but he was soundly beaten in his sole bumper (good to soft) and it was the same story on last month's hurdle debut at Leicester (1m7f, heavy); lots of improvement needed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two-time bumper runner-up; improvement needed on second hurdle start but that's possible
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in two strong bumpers then tailed off at Punchestown festival last May; a bit underwhelming on hurdle debut over C&D in November but he's with a top trainer and could leave that latest run well behind.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Wetherby before close second at Newcastle and this could be a good opportunity
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wetherby (2m, good to soft) in December and went very close at Newcastle (2m4f, soft) last time; even with the penalty and the drop back in trip, this could be a good opportunity to return to winning ways.
