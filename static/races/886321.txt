🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not seen since Irish point win in November 2023 but makes rules debut in a modest race
🔦 Spotlight: Half-sister to very useful Irish hurdler Blacklough and useful British hurdler Banjo Girl; bought for £90,000 soon after winning soft-ground Irish point in November 2023; this rules debut comes after a long absence but in a modest race; no surprise if she's up to the task.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in two Irish maiden hurdles for Henry de Bromhead last September; sold for £15,500 soon after short-odds reverse on latter occasion and has a point to prove on this stable debut but was given a wind op last month and appears to have been found a very good opportunity.
