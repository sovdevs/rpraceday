🔦 Spotlight: Big prices and well beaten in two runs this spring; Paul Mulrennan takes over today but this filly has a bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2024-07-08 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "Six [furlongs] is definitely Carmarthen's trip. She leaves a lot for herself, I'm not saying she's ungenuine but she's still learning and it took a horse to come to her before she could put the race to bed. She idled pretty much the whole way and, if we direct her the right way, she should be winning again  - Edward Greatrex, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
