💬 Comment: Hold strong claims on juvenile form, second on either side of fourth behind a top prospect
🔦 Spotlight: Second in four-runner race at Tipperary on debut before fourth behind potential star The Lion In Winter in a 7f Curragh maiden in July; form also boosted by third-placed Ides Of March, and less emphatically by runner-up Currawood; beaten a head by the useful-looking Glenderry at Dundalk in October; has been ✂️ gelded; should be hard to beat.
