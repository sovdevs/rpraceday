🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**

💬 Comment: Three solid efforts this year but she's 0-13 in handicaps and others look stronger
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to add to her 5f novice win in spring 2023 but she's returned from a break with three solid placed efforts over 7f (Tapeta) this year; hard to rule out another good run but she's now 0-13 in handicaps and this is a big step back up in grade.
