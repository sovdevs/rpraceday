🔦 Spotlight: Fair form up to this trip, including a minor win, last year; also excuses for some heavy defeats; has been off for six months, but yard continues to go well.
Horse quote: 2024-06-14 at Chester (7f): "Manila Thriller is a nice, big filly who was green first time out like some of mine can be, but we felt she could improve. It was a really nice pot and it was better than winning any novice. On a more conventional track she'll have a bit more speed, but she should hopefully be a nice filly to win a couple of novices with - Jack Channon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't progress after winning 7f Epsom fillies' maiden last summer; off since October
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't progress after winning four-runner 7f Epsom fillies' maiden last summer (good ground); off since October; up in trip.
Horse quote: 2024-08-16 at Epsom (7f): "Graduated looks like she's really progressed from her first few runs. Last week at Brighton I didn't think she had an overly hard race against the 1-14 shot Praetorian and we had to play second fiddle to him. We tried to dictate it here and it went well. She's still got the entry [sales race at York] next Thursday and, while we're not guaranteed a run, we'll take a view about it. We'll see how she is after the weekend but it could be a possibility. Seven furlongs is definitely her trip but with the prize-money on offer I wouldn't be opposed to dropping her back in trip for one run and she has a turn of foot - Jamie Insole, joint-trainer."
