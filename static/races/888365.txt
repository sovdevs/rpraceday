🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved form when second here last month; 🔥 big player if handling this less testing ground
🔦 Spotlight: 3-5 under rules; showed improved form when second of 12 in handicap over extended 2m6f here last month, fading; this slightly shorter trip should be in his favour and he'll be a 🔥 big player if handling today's less testing ground (has raced only on soft).

🔦 Spotlight: Seemed to be treading water over hurdles but wind surgery was a catalyst for an improved effort and a breakthrough win at Carlisle (2m3f, good to soft) last month; should have no problem with today's longer trip; more progress needed but that's possible.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dead-heated in point in November; that form looks modest but he's respected on rules debut
🔦 Spotlight: Improved in Irish points last year, dead-heating for first in November; that form looks modest but he's joined an in-form yard and must be considered on rules debut, especially if the market speaks in his favour.

🔦 Spotlight: Yet to make the frame in two bumpers or a novice hurdle (2m, good; 25-1); lots to find on form but he's stoutly bred and today's big step up in distance looks a positive move.
