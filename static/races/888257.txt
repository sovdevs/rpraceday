🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ability for former yard but tailed off last month after an absence; chasing debut
🔦 Spotlight: Showed significant promise for Oliver Sherwood but, after a long absence, he went off at 100-1 for a Hereford handicap hurdle on his stable debut a month ago and finished tailed off; goes chasing with a lot to prove.
