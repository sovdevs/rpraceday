🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't run badly last time and is of strong interest if judged on earlier Taunton second
🔦 Spotlight: Well held when third at Wincanton (2m5f, good to soft) in February but that run was arguably much better than his eventual 44l defeat might suggest, and he's of strong interest here if judged on his second of 16 behind a next-time-out winner at Taunton (2m3f, good to soft) two starts ago.
