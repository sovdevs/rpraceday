💬 Comment: Both wins over 6f on AW but acts well on turf; first 5f run; 🆕 new yard won this in 2021
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-John Ryan; both wins over 6f on AW; has struggled at the weights since taking a hit for an excellent Group 3 run at Ascot (good) in 2023 but he was back in form when runner-up in a good  6f race at Doncaster (soft) in October; back up 3lb but he's well worth a go at 5f; Ryan Moore is a rare booking now for 🆕 new yard that won this in 2021.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Another step forward for 5f Ascot win in July; refused to race next time; off since
🔦 Spotlight: Made great strides last summer, showing how far he'd come when a cosy Ascot winner (5f, good; has won on soft) in July; out of the blue he refused to race at Glorious Goodwood (favourite) when last seen later that month, when rider reported he was lethargic to post; set for a good season if that was a one-off.
Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at Ascot (5f): "Fair Wind is learning his trade in these top sprints. We still feel there is a little bit of untapped potential and he's going the right way - Owen Burrows, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2024-07-05 at Doncaster (5f): "Brave Nation has been in great shape. He ran well here two starts ago and ran a great race again at Sandown last time. He's got a lot of natural speed and hopefully he can start to climb back up the ranks - Billy Loughnane, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Close 3rd here in 2024 then beat Fair Wind at Ascot; below best later; well treated again
🔦 Spotlight: Best of three runs in this race when a close third in 2024 and later beat Fair Wind (has improved since) and Brave Nation at Ascot (5f, good to soft); went off the rails later in the year but he's 6lb lower than last spring so could be ripe for a revival; yard also runs The X O.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form at 6f on AW; unraced at 5f; bit to prove for new trainer
🔦 Spotlight: In good form at 6f on AW since blinkers fitted, winning at Newcastle in January, but needs to improve for the drop to 5f as he's at least 4lb higher than for three turf handicap defeats; new trainer.
