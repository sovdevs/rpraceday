🔦 Spotlight: Ex-John Ryan; both wins over 6f on AW; has struggled at the weights since taking a hit for an excellent Group 3 run at Ascot (good) in 2023 but he was back in form when runner-up in a good  6f race at Doncaster (soft) in October; back up 3lb but he's well worth a go at 5f; Ryan Moore is a rare booking now for 🆕 new yard that won this in 2021.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Another step forward for 5f Ascot win in July; refused to race next time; off since
🔦 Spotlight: Made great strides last summer, showing how far he'd come when a cosy Ascot winner (5f, good; has won on soft) in July; out of the blue he refused to race at Glorious Goodwood (favourite) when last seen later that month, when rider reported he was lethargic to post; set for a good season if that was a one-off.
Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at Ascot (5f): "Fair Wind is learning his trade in these top sprints. We still feel there is a little bit of untapped potential and he's going the right way - Owen Burrows, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Creditable reappearance on AW last week and likely to be straighter today; has done all his winning at Doncaster (5f) but he does have form elsewhere and in his favour that the ground has dried out again.
Horse quote: 2024-07-05 at Doncaster (5f): "Brave Nation has been in great shape. He ran well here two starts ago and ran a great race again at Sandown last time. He's got a lot of natural speed and hopefully he can start to climb back up the ranks - Billy Loughnane, rider."

💬 Comment: Best form on good or quicker; high spots of career when 3rd at Goodwood (5f), then 6f win
🔦 Spotlight: Best form on good or quicker ground; bled from the nose when well behind Fair Wind at Ascot last July but that experience didn't bother him when a very good third of 16 at Glorious Goodwood (5f) shortly after, nor for a Windsor win (6f) next time; just 2lb higher here; considered.
Horse quote: 2023-06-09 at Bath (5.5f): "Toca Madera had done everything right first time, and was a little bit unlucky, but he did that well. We'll see how he comes out of it. He didn't like the ground but Kieran was very complimentary, saying he'll be better on much better ground. With rain round the corner Royal Ascot is a possibility - Brian Meehan, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."
