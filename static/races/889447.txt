💬 Comment: Course winner who was close 2nd over C&D in November; competitive if primed after a break
🔦 Spotlight: Broke his Flat duck over 1m4f in October; also a course winner over hurdles who might have won over C&D (good) in November had it not been for losing momentum at the last two flights; solid claims if primed after a break.
