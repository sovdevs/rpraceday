🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form of Uttoxeter win has been franked and a 7lb rise now looks lenient
🔦 Spotlight: Point/maiden winner; sent off favourite for stable debut at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good to soft) and after a wide trip he kept on well to win going away; that form looks all the stronger now with runner-up Wellington Arch winning at Aintree earlier this month; 7lb rise seems lenient.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up over 2m5f at Ayr behind one who dominated from the outset
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins divided between bumpers/hurdles and has been highly tried on occasions; ran a solid race to finish second at Ayr (2m5f, good to soft) behind one who dominated from the outset; this 7yo was clear of the third; good chance.
Horse quote: 2023-12-11 at Ayr (16f): "His hurdling was good and Florida Dreams got the job done, but I don't think for a second he was liking the ground. He wasn't spectacular, but he's looking like he wants two and a half miles on better ground. Before we ran him over hurdles we half thought we'd give him a couple of runs and then head to the Formby (formerly the Tolworth) at Aintree, but he probably doesn't want winter ground. We'll see how he is in the next couple of weeks and make a plan - Nicky Richards, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this last year; chasing this season with only one blip; respected back from a break
🔦 Spotlight: Only 3lb higher than when winning this by 3l 12 months ago and has been chasing this season, starting off well but producing a lesser run last time; can go well fresh; could well be involved once more.
Horse quote: 2024-11-05 at Warwick (20f): "I don't think Rambo T liked making the running to be honest. Uttoxeter, two miles is a lovely place to get a horse started. He got a nice bit of experience that day and we got beat, but that stood him in good stead. He's been a real fun horse for connections and hopefully he'll carry on improving - Ollie Murphy, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Low-mileage 8yo who has won both his handicaps; raised a fair 4lb for the latest
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 8yo who has won both his handicaps, the latest by a narrow margin at Kelso (2m5f, good to soft); only 4lb higher and may well progress some more; races prominently.
Horse quote: 2025-01-01 at Musselburgh (20f): "Bold Light was sold for £50,000 three years ago, but when he was taken home the owner found out he had a hole in his leg, so took him back to the sales. I then bought him for £1,000 and it turned out to be quite a bad injury, the vet told me it was better to put him out of his misery. We put him out in Ruth Jardine's [sister of trainer Iain] field for three years, and it's done the world for him. He's been fantastic ever since, we couldn't complain at all. After he finished third at Haydock we were scratching our heads and wondering where to go, we came here and the next plan will be the Scottish County Hurdle here on February 1. We think we'll stick to hurdles because we want to look after him  - James Scott, owner."

🔦 Spotlight: Has generally done well since joining this yard from Harry Derham, winning twice over C&D; hasn't run at all badly in his subsequent defeats and can make presence felt.
Horse quote: 2023-03-22 at Haydock (15.5f): "The first time Fourofakind was a bit disappointing and didn't jump properly, but he ran really well at Newbury last time behind a nice horse of Nicky's [Henderson]. I thought this was an appropriate opportunity and he stepped forward and took the chance. The reason he lugs left is his breathing isn't perfect and I'll definitely get that done in the summer. I'm going to take him to Ascot on April 2nd for a valuable handicap, if he gets in, and I think a nice gallop there will bring out the best in him - Harry Derham, trainer."

💬 Comment: No show in a Doncaster Grade 2 last time; form is more convincing racing right handed
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner; struggled in a Grade 2 at Doncaster last time but her form is far more convincing on right-handed tracks; only 4lb higher than for her Kempton win the time before; solid claims.
Horse quote: 2024-02-29 at Ludlow (24f): "Della Casa Lunga is a nice horse and likes Ludlow, she's got better as the season's gone on. We know how best to ride her now so hopefully she'll continue to go on from this - Clive Boultbee-Brooks, owner-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good mark but has shown very little over hurdles or fences this season
🔦 Spotlight: On a dangerous mark, being 3lb lower than for a chase victory at this fixture last year; whether he can return to that level is debatable after this season's struggles, the latest on his return to hurdles.
Horse quote: 2023-02-04 at Sandown (16f): "I think Chasing Fire is good but I don't know how good. Could he win a Supreme? I've had a second and third but never the winner. I'm not too bothered about taking on any of the other two-mile novices we've got in Britain, although the horse who won the Tolworth here is obviously good. If he didn't go to Cheltenham he would be all but favourite for a Grade 1 at Aintree, and that would be the Gold Cup of his novice hurdle career. Whatever he does this season, he is going to be a very good chaser next season. I've only been training for five years and never had a champion but I hope this one can be good - Olly Murphy, trainer."
