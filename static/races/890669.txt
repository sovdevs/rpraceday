🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over 6f (turf) last time but he's back to a career-high mark and yet to win at 5f
🔦 Spotlight: First visit here but has won on Polytrack; running consistently on AW before getting up late on when switched to turf at Leicester (6f, good to firm) a fortnight ago; likely to be thereabouts but a 2lb nudge puts him back to his career-high mark and the drop back to 5f (0-4) asks a question.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: One win and 12 seconds tells a story; form chance though and he gets Ryan Moore first time
🔦 Spotlight: Not one for the faint-hearted with one win (a 5f Wolverhampton maiden at 4-11 in 2023) and 12 seconds on his scorecard, but he was running well in January and might have just needed it at Kempton (6f) in March after a pause; off another 44 days since but this is a career-low mark and Ryan Moore rides him for the first time.

Horse quote: 2025-02-24 at Wolverhampton (AW) (5f): "I knew they were going to go pretty hard but I was able to sit a little bit further forward than I did last time. Maharajas Express is quite a keen horse but he relaxed nice enough halfway and it took a while to really hit top gear today. I got a bit of luck up the straight but he's very tough and there's more improvement in him - David Probert, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second on his last three starts over C&D but needs to break well from stall 10.
🔦 Spotlight: Made all for back-to-back wins on turf last July, latterly at Yarmouth (5f, good); runner-up on his last three starts over C&D, including last month when making an encouraging return from a 64-day break (Secret Handsheikh fifth); could give it another good go but will need to break sharply from stall 10.

💬 Comment: No win since June but latest start was a step back in the right direction; possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: 5f specialist but she hasn't won since scoring at Yarmouth (good to firm) last June; took a step back in the right direction over C&D last time, however, and she's dropped to a career-low mark; has won here before and could outrun her likely odds.
Horse quote: 2024-06-28 at Yarmouth (5f): "Angle Land is a tough filly and that was a good performance with 10st 2lb on her back - Neil Callan, jockey."

💬 Comment: Encouraging return over C&D three weeks ago and could take a step forward from that
🔦 Spotlight: A respectable 10-60 record includes six wins when making all; 3-11 on AW and he made an encouraging return over C&D three weeks ago, weakening inside the last having pressed a good pace set by Merrimack (second); no surprise if he lasts longer this time and he's well drawn to go forward.
Horse quote: 2021-02-04 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "Secret Handsheikh was a convincing winner last time and went up 9lb but he loves this surface. He skips off the surface and has such a good attitude - Hollie Doyle, jockey."
