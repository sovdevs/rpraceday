🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat an easy subsequent winner at Stratford and he's firmly in the reckoning
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish 8yo who was paying his way in points before beating his market rival (impressed next time at Kempton) in a 2m5f hunter chase at Stratford (good to soft; effective on good); this shorter trip asks different questions but firmly in the reckoning.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this last year and returns on the back of an excellent fifth at Aintree last month
🔦 Spotlight: Prolific winner in points; coped fine with the drop in trip when a narrow winner of this last year and returns on the back of an excellent fifth in the hunter chase at Aintree's National meeting (only weakened on the run-in); may ideally wants the ground a little softer but solid chance otherwise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needs improvement on these terms but only a 6yo and having second run over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner (heavy/good) for Gary Moore and later competitive in handicap company for Adam West, for whom he signed off with a remote third on chase debut at Sandown (1m7f handicap); only a 6yo and could retain some potential in this discipline, though needs improvement on these terms.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice placed in this race and ran respectably in handicaps last year
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in the 2022 and 2023 renewals of this race and ran well on occasions in handicaps last year for Gary Hanmer; has changed trainers again but clearly won't be fazed by the demands of this assignment.
Horse quote: 2023-01-09 at Taunton (23f): "Envious Editor is a lovely horse, we always thought the world of him. Aintree [Foxhunters] is the plan, along with Cousin Pascal. I imagine this one will go to the Walrus [Hunter Chase] at Haydock [February 18] and then onto Aintree. He's a great jumper, that's the best thing about him - Joe O'Shea, trainer."
