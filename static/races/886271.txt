🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful in bumpers and first blip over hurdles came last time on heavy ground
🔦 Spotlight: Ran poorly on handicap debut last time but that was her first run on heavy ground (effective on soft); useful in bumpers and had made a good start over hurdles, winning at Market Rasen and second in a Listed race (good to soft); should go close, at the least.
