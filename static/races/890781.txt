💬 Comment: Showed likeness for good ground when runner-up to the well-treated Rushmount at Thurles
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner; off the mark at third attempt in Tramore maiden hurdle at Tramore (21.5f, heavy) on New Year's Day but showed likeness for good ground when runner-up to the well-treated Rushmount at Thurles two weeks ago; big chance from same mark.
