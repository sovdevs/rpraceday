🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won last August but well beaten the last twice; returns from a break and wind surgery
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Windsor (5f, good to firm) last August for Roger Varian but well beaten towards the end of last year on first two runs for this yard and hopes are pinned on the subsequent wind surgery prompting a revival.
