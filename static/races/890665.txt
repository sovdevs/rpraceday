🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unblemished 2yo campaign on turf included Group 3 and Group 2 wins; clear top on ratings
🔦 Spotlight: Blue Point filly whose unblemished 2yo campaign comprised 6f wins in Newbury maiden, Ayr Group 3 and Chantilly Group 2; clear top on ratings and likely to remain unbeaten provided she takes to AW.
Horse quote: 2024-10-12 at Chantilly (6f): "Christophe said Sky Majesty didn't relish the ground, but she handled it. She did really well and the second filly, whether or not she ran to her best I don't know, but she's got some very good form. I don't think she does a lot [when she gets to the front]. She won a nose in her maiden and then a neck in the Firth of Clyde, so it looks like the better the race, the further she wins - William Haggas, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seemed to run very well against her elders in Doncaster Listed race on reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: Won the Hilary Needler on debut; 0-5 since but seemed to run very well, despite traffic issues, against her elders in Doncaster Listed race (6f) on reappearance; interesting assuming she backs up that effort.
Horse quote: 2024-06-08 at Beverley (5f): "We had Perfect Part out of the stalls two or three times in the last couple of weeks and she came out of them like an absolute rocket. And I saw she was a huge price, I thought they must know something we don't! We thought she was good.  She breezed absolutely brilliantly but she was a late foal and she hasn't got the size. I think that's why I got her so cheap. It was mitigating circumstances - Keith Brown, owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Limitations exposed since debut win; stiff task on ratings
🔦 Spotlight: Successful in first outing; limitations exposed since, most recently a modest fourth in French Listed event on stable/seasonal debut; stiff task on ratings and easy to oppose.
Horse quote: 2024-06-06 at Hamilton (6f): "Liberalised was impressive. She's been showing us all the right signs at home and she's the sort of filly who does everything so easily. You can never be sure first time out but Karl [Burke, trainer] has got a good gauge on his two-year-olds and she's bound to improve - Danny Tudhope, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."
