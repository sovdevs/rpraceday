💬 Comment: Unlucky not to go closer behind Kyber Crystal latest; is one of the likelier winners
🔦 Spotlight: C&D win last April came off a 4lb higher mark and he looked unlucky not to go closer behind Kyber Crystal back on turf at Musselburgh three weeks ago; is one of the likelier winners for a yard in good form.

💬 Comment: Close to career-best effort on her C&D comeback; this is tougher from a wide stall though
🔦 Spotlight: Dual 0-50 classified winner last summer who turned in close to a career-best effort on her C&D comeback a fortnight ago, also for William Pyle in an apprentice handicap; this is a deeper race, though, and she's drawn much wider today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Likes Musselburgh and duly won there on her comeback; needs a bit more again upped 3lb
🔦 Spotlight: Can fluff the start but got it right when making a winning comeback at Musselburgh, a course she likes, three weeks ago; 3lb higher today and 4lb worse off with the unlucky Fortunate Star so needs a bit more again.
Horse quote: 2024-09-22 at Hamilton (5f): "We kept it simple and got the job done. Kyber Crystal has plenty of form on soft ground, so hopefully we should have some fun with her through the autumn - Rebecca Menzies, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't offer much on her comeback, so others look stronger on today's course debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won plenty down the years and is 6lb lower than when last successful; finished last season on a downswing, though, and she didn't offer much on her comeback, so others look stronger on today's course debut.
Horse quote: 2024-01-27 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "She's a really game mare. I thought Hurt You Never might need the run but she showed she's in great form. Early on I thought I'd gone a bit quick but she just kept powering through - Mia Nicholls, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Currently 3-5 here and 3-3 over 6f following three victories last autumn; reared at the stalls on his comeback a fortnight ago, so that can be ignored, but whether they'll come back to him over this easy 5f (stays 7f well) is the question.
