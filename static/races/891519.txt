🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Met trouble at Pontefract last time; not ruled out off the same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Met trouble at Pontefract last time when still in contention; stable still not quite firing on all cylinders but enough of them are running well to make him of interest.
Horse quote: 2021-04-19 at Pontefract (5f): "Ventura Express jumped a little bit slow but he soon travelled well through the race and he picked up and won nicely. I thought he would run well but I didn't quite expect that. He's been gelded which makes a massive difference because I don't think there's much else different than what Richard Fahey does, they're a lot better than us! - Paul Midgley, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still has potential at 5f and he should be sharper for his recent return; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Form took off in the autumn when returned to 5f and faced with soft ground, winning at Doncaster (officially good but changed to soft after the race) before solid runs at Ascot and Doncaster; looked as though the run was needed on his Pontefract reappearance and he remains capable of rating a fair bit higher.
Horse quote: 2024-07-08 at Ayr (6f): "Venture Capital showed a lot of speed last time at Thirsk and immediately after the race my old man felt that sprinting could be his gig and he's shown that there. It was only his first try over six furlongs so I'd like to think there's a lot more to come from him. There's some nice sprints in the summer and he's shown he handles the ground there. We'll see what the handicapper does but he could progress now at that trip. The time was good there and in these big sprint handicaps you need a horse that stays the trip well so that's a big positive. We'll see what comes up but I'm sure by the end of the year there will be bigger and better things on the horizon - Adam Ryan, trainer's son and assistant."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Royal Ascot win last summer makes him of interest; excuses since; still quite low mileage
🔦 Spotlight: Bolted up at Musselburgh last June (5f, good to soft) before making light of an 11lb rise at Royal Ascot, beating 27 rivals in the Palace Of Holyrood House (5f, good to firm); drawn poorly at the Ebor meeting and both subsequent defeats can be forgiven too; mark not impossible if returning to his best but he didn't live up to market billing on his return last April.
Horse quote: 2024-06-21 at Ascot (5f): "Pilgrim has done it well there. I thought he might have knackered his handicap mark at Musselburgh. We always thought that he was a really nice horse, not just a good two-year-old, and he's shown there today he's good. It's a great place to come and have a winner so it's very nice. This lad has a lot of speed. He travelled very well and he won quite comfortably. He done it easy - Joe Fanning, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hit hard for a conditions race win last September; well beaten on return; vulnerable
🔦 Spotlight: High in the weights after a productive 2024 campaign, having been hit hard for a conditions race win at Beverley (5f, good) in September; has a tough task with Venture Capital on their run at Doncaster earlier that month and was well beaten at Southwell nine weeks ago; looks vulnerable.
Horse quote: 2024-09-24 at Beverley (5f): "It wasn't my plan to come here, but when I saw the entries I said to the lads we're going to have to throw him in as it was only going to be four runners. Fair play to Ali Rawlinson [rider of King Of Stars], he and Mia had a talk as we all know how King Of Stars runs. I said to Mia see how you jump, see how Ali jumps and go from there, as there was no point in the two of them taking each other on because it's a long way home with a bit of give in the ground. Mia gave him a good ride. She's doing really well and she's at the right stable with Eve [Johnson Houghton], and she used her head there. Tees Spirit came into the race in good form and he's been a star this year. Emaraaty Ana had the form in the book, so it was a great performance and I'm chuffed to bits for Mia and the horse - Adrian Nicholls, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Sharper for return and likely he'll bag the stand rail; yard won this in 2022 and 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Useful on his day, winning twice last season (6f, good; 5f, good to soft); finished behind Venture Capital at Pontefract on his reappearance (raced wide) 18 days ago and like that rival he should be sharper for the run; likely to bag the stand rail from stall 6 and Amie Waugh takes off a useful 3lb; of interest for a yard that won this in 2022 and 2023.
Horse quote: 2024-08-08 at Chepstow (5f): "Manila Scouse probably just likes the rain and the uphill finish, because he stays six [furlongs] so he travels really strong as well and gets through the line strong - David Allan, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
