🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Early in the year to be tackling older opposition but her ability commands respect
🔦 Spotlight: Only had three runs for Gavin Cromwell, making a lot of the running to win a 1m2f soft-ground maiden at the Curragh before facing a tough task at Listed level; respected, for all that it's early in the year to be tackling older opposition.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Curragh (10f): "J M's Joy surprised me as it wasn't the plan to make the running, she kind of ended up there. I thought she went a good gallop and I wasn't sure whether she'd see it out over the trip but she was gutsy. She was fit and had a couple of runs, while she handled the ground well. It's a nice pot to win - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has winning potential off this mark and hasn't been running badly under either code
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 since debut win over 7f at the Curragh; however, not disgraced over hurdles or on the Flat (7f/1m2f) in her last four races and has winning potential off this mark.
Horse quote: 2024-03-18 at Curragh (7f): "Money Dancer behaved herself better here than she does at home, she's very bouncy and not simple. But she has always shown us plenty. She has been tipping along all winter but we liked the couple of pieces of work she did. She found plenty and handled the trip well. We will roll the dice a bit with her now. With those fillies, you are as well off to get what you can when you can with them, so we will go for a Listed race somewhere - Noel Meade, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairly handicapped back on the Flat and a return to form over hurdles last time bodes well
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a four-timer in 1m-1m4f handicaps in 2023 on which she's fairly handicapped; a return to form over hurdles last time (runner-up) bodes well.
Horse quote: 2023-11-07 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Fratas is a good hurdler, we have known that for a while. She had a hard season on the Flat and she deserves a break. She will be better on better ground, that was tough work today - Mick Mulvany, trainer"

Horse quote: 2024-08-07 at Sligo (10.5f): "No Niki No will stay 1m6f or 2m if she had to. I knew that if she could see the second filly coming at her that she would find. She battles well - Chris Hayes, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointed over hurdles last time but very capable in a Flat race of this nature
🔦 Spotlight: Won 1m4f/1m7f handicaps last year on slow and goodish ground; much higher in the weights now but has shown she can deal with this mark; disappointing over hurdles most recently but perhaps unwise to read too much into that.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Leopardstown (15f): "Sceptred Isle got up in spite of the ground. There is a race in Galway but I think we'll skip it and pick something in a while once she's okay - George Kingston, trainer"
