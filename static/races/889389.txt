🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four hurdle wins; he's not one for maximum faith but the same is true of his rivals
🔦 Spotlight: The last of four hurdle wins came in a seller at Plumpton in November (2m, good); well beaten on chase debut two runs back but again disappointed when favourite for a claiming hurdle at Catterick last time (behind Honneur d'Ajonc); he's not one for maximum faith but the same is true of his rivals.
