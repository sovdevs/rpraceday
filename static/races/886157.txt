🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Market Rasen on second chase start and third in strong race at Taunton since
🔦 Spotlight: Won a handicap hurdle here (2m5f, soft) last March and scored at Market Rasen (3m, good) in November on his second chase start; came under early pressure when third of five at Taunton (2m7f, good to soft) a fortnight later but that form has been strongly franked by the first two; strong claims.

📝 Comment: in rear, headway before 2 out, never near to challenge nudged out (an inquiry was held into running and riding; rider and trainer were interviewed; vet examined gelding which was selected for routine testing on two occasions post-race and had nothing to report; having initially failed to report anything when passing scales post-race, jockey said several minutes after having been informed that he was required to attend an inquiry into ride on gelding, that gelding had made a respiratory noise during race; jockey said his instructions were to ride gelding at rear of field, get him settled and creep into race with the aim of making a late challenge as gelding has not been seeing his races out; he continued that gelding jumped and travelled well up until 3rd last fence where it began to make the aforementioned noise; however, it was from this point on that gelding began to make both steady and eyecatching progress under sympathetic handling and jockey justified his apparent lack of effort by reiterating the fact that gelding is a weak finisher, and it was his intention to get there as late as possible for this reason, but on this occasion having jumped the last fence gelding emptied out again; trainer said his instructions were to ride gelding with restraint and to get there late; having become aware of the respiratory noise trainer said that he was satisfied with ride and that he would have gelding seen by a vet regarding his  respiratory issue;)

🔦 Spotlight: Won when back over fences for his handicap debut over C&D (soft) in December and bumped into 📈 progressive winner when second of five at Leicester (2m6f, soft) last time; won a point on good to soft; this return to a left-handed track could boost his claims and he's 🚀 open to further improvement.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Uttoxeter on second chase start and fair 5th since; could still have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 3-7 when winning in first-time cheekpieces at Uttoxeter (3m, soft) in December on second chase start; also effective on good ground; fair fifth at Newbury (2m7f, soft) last time and this lightly raced 8yo could still have more to offer; first-time blinkers replace the cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran in snatches at Market Rasen but this return to a left-handed track may help
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't kicked on from promising start to his career in 2022 and he made it 0-6 over fences when running in snatches in first-time cheekpieces (retained) at Market Rasen in November; however, he didn't run badly in that 5l third of three and this return to a left-handed track may help; not ruled out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Underwhelming the last twice but the visor may help him tap back into chase debut promise
🔦 Spotlight: Somewhat underwhelming on his last two starts but prior to those this two-time novice hurdle winner (soft/good to soft) was runner-up at Exeter (3m, good) on his chase debut, and perhaps the first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) will help him tap back into that promise; player if so.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a handicap hurdle here (2m5f, soft) last March and scored at Market Rasen (3m, good) in November on his second chase start; came under early pressure when third of five at Taunton (2m7f, good to soft) a fortnight later but that form has been strongly franked by the first two; strong claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Underwhelming the last twice but the visor may help him tap back into chase debut promise
🔦 Spotlight: Somewhat underwhelming on his last two starts but prior to those this two-time novice hurdle winner (soft/good to soft) was runner-up at Exeter (3m, good) on his chase debut, and perhaps the first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) will help him tap back into that promise; player if so.

💬 Comment: Unseated on two of his last three starts but can play a leading role granted a clear round
🔦 Spotlight: Has unseated on two of his last three starts but was going well at the time (eight out) at Catterick latest (3m1f, good to soft); prior to that he kept on for a fair third at Leicester (2m4f, soft); his last two wins came over 3m1f/3m and he can play a leading role granted a clear round.

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't kicked on from promising start to his career in 2022 and he made it 0-6 over fences when running in snatches in first-time cheekpieces (retained) at Market Rasen in November; however, he didn't run badly in that 5l third of three and this return to a left-handed track may help; not ruled out.
