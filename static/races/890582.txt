🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all last three races, with a last-flight mistake latest; up another 5lb but on a roll
🔦 Spotlight: Made all at Uttoxeter (2m4f), Market Rasen (extended 2m7f) and Doncaster (3m, good) on last three outings, with a last-flight mistake not helping his margin of victory last time; up another 5lb but he's on a roll.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Doncaster (24.5f): "Burrows Hall has improved again because I thought the mare would win today. He'd gone up a bit for winning but she'd [Rialannah] stayed where she was and we'd waited for the ground with her. It's a shame to run them together, but they needed to run for the final. She'll probably run again beforehand, he probably won't. It's hard to tell how much improvement there is in him because he's so tough. He's not very big. The idea was to go novice chasing but he needs a small track and there hasn't been enough novice chases around those courses. We've set our stall out for this final at Haydock - Joel Parkinson, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Plucky front-running stayer who's had a thoroughly commendable season under Olive Nicholls
🔦 Spotlight: Plucky front-running stayer who's had a thoroughly commendable season under Olive Nicholls, including in competitive handicaps and with cheekpieces on last five starts; he needs to pull out extra once again, though.
Horse quote: 2024-12-21 at Ascot (23.5f): "It seems to have taken a while. Thank You Ma'am has been second six times and deserves to get his head in front and I'm really chuffed. We were going to go straight over fences next but I'm not sure now because that looked like his best performance. He stays well but I'd say he doesn't want bottomless ground through the winter - Georgie Nicholls, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Missed last season and has not fired this term but he's now 14lb below his peak mark
🔦 Spotlight: Missed last season and has not fired this term but he's now 14lb below his peak mark and all of his wins have been on good ground; he's been too well beaten for comfort this term, notwithstanding the softer ground, but needs a close look and 📊 market check.
Horse quote: 2022-04-16 at Haydock (24.5f): "An Tailliur is a great little horse who keeps on improving and likes good ground, which is key to him. He had a good few races so we had to give him a bit of a break and you could see he needed it but he hung on. He'll go through the summer, the owner is from Galway and we'll see what's there in the summer - Jonjo O'Neill, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Can front-run; won three small-field handicaps this season, including his last two starts
🔦 Spotlight: Can front-run; won three small-field handicaps this season, including last two starts and the latest (on good to firm; under Calumn Pritchard) seemed to be a career best; up another 6lb and it's not clear whether soft ground can be blamed for lesser efforts in two more competitive fields, but he needs plenty of respect.

💬 Comment: Fair 3rd to Burrows Hall on h'cap debut at Doncaster (3m, good) but needs markedly better
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 in Irish points; placed in his two bumpers and off the mark in a maiden at Ludlow (3m, good to soft) in February on third start over hurdles; fair third of six to Burrows Hall on handicap debut at Doncaster (3m, good) last month but needs markedly better than that with his mark unchanged.
