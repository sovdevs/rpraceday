💬 Comment: Second over 2m at Warwick in May; below par over 2m4f latest; conditions will suit; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable second in a mares' maiden hurdle at Warwick in May (2m, good); hasn't really progressed and was disappointing in a Plumpton handicap in December (2m4f, good to soft); return to 2m on better ground should suit; worth considering on return from a break.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3,000euros buy after two places in Irish points; fair hurdles debut (2m4f); 2m a concern
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for 3,000euros after being placed in two Irish points in October/November last year; 23l fourth in a Sedgefield mares' novice in January on her stable debut (2m4f, soft); likely to improve on that but not sure this drop in trip is ideal.
