🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Landed the odds in Naas bumper; front 2 pulled long way clear; should improve
🔦 Spotlight: Justified favouritism when landing a Naas bumper in January and since acquired by JP McManus; the front two (re-opposing Scarriff Bridge runner-up) pulled a long way clear of the rest in that contest and she's interesting with improvement likely for a yard that are 4-8 in bumpers this season.

🔦 Spotlight: Won four-runner bumper at Naas on debut and there was plenty to like about his subsequent 1l defeat to re-opposing Oneinthewell; doesn't have to concede 7lb in weight to that rival this time around and should be firmly in the mix.

🔦 Spotlight: Did well to chase down Eternal Echo when a well backed favourite at Leopardstown three weeks ago; doesn't get 7lb from that rival this time but will surely improve from that initial experience and one for the shortlist.

🔦 Spotlight: Court Cave gelding; cost 62,000euros as 3yo; brother to smart bumper/2m-2m5f hurdle winner City Island, closely related to two winners including Easy Street (useful 2m4f-3m1f chase), half-brother to four winners including Fort Worth (useful bumper/2m4f-3m jumps); intriguing newcomer, particuarly with O'Connor on but pedigree points to him wanting further.
