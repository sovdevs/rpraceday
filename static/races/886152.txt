🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed over C&D since Fontwell win in November; likely contender again today
🔦 Spotlight: Held on well to win from the front at Fontwell (2m5f, good; refitted cheekpieces) in November and gave another good account when third of 13 over C&D (good to soft) in December; his tendency to jump right is a slight concern but, otherwise, he has pretty solid claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unreliable nowadays but has won this season and is suited by this C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Not very reliable nowadays but exploited career-low chase mark at Fontwell (3m2f, good; refitted cheekpieces) in November and was probably not suited by the soft/heavy ground when below that form on next two outings; has a C&D win on his CV; can't be ruled out.

🔦 Spotlight: Yet fully to convince stamina-wise over this far but was in good form for Sophie Leech when last seen in 2023 and starts off for 🆕 new yard on a tempting mark; can be dangerous if fully tuned up; market may guide.

💬 Comment: Last month's third here was encouraging and she might be building up to something
🔦 Spotlight: Course winner over hurdles in 2023; returned from long absence with two underwhelming chase runs in December but last month's keeping-on third here (2m3f, soft) was more encouraging and she might be building up to something.

🔦 Spotlight: Didn't run badly when sixth of 13 over C&D (good to soft) on chasing debut two months ago but has largely been very disappointing since his three hurdle wins in 2022; cheekpieces given a whirl today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went very close at Catterick recently and will be suited by the return to this C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up in December, after a break, but rebounded with big run in defeat at Catterick (2m3f, soft) 12 days ago and will be suited by the return to this C&D; one to consider.

💬 Comment: Soundly beaten over hurdles on both stable starts; considered only if lively in betting
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time chase winner; sold out of Harry Derham's stable after disappointing run in October and did not show a great deal in two hurdle races for Ryan Potter in November; considered only if lively in the betting.

💬 Comment: Didn't run badly over C&D on chasing debut but has basically become very disappointing
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't run badly when sixth of 13 over C&D (good to soft) on chasing debut two months ago but has largely been very disappointing since his three hurdle wins in 2022; cheekpieces given a whirl today.

🔦 Spotlight: Yet fully to convince stamina-wise over this far but was in good form for Sophie Leech when last seen in 2023 and starts off for 🆕 new yard on a tempting mark; can be dangerous if fully tuned up; market may guide.
