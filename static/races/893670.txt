🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved with blinkers with 3 wins over 2m4f at Newcastle; stiffer task but on the upgrade
🔦 Spotlight: Improved form with cheekpieces, completing a hat-trick in 2m4f handicaps at Newcastle when beating Regal And Royal (runs in the first division) by 1.5l last time; up another 9lb (has gone up 21lb in total); could go well again.
Horse quote: 2025-03-03 at Newcastle (20.5f): "Luminaries had a big ulcer and it's just taken a bit of time to get him back, but we've always thought he's a horse who's capable of running a big race - Ewan Whillans, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Came back in good form after a three-month break with two sound runs last month, better effort when third at Catterick in a race that has worked out well (2m3f, good); didn't fare as well dropped back to 2m last time (didn't jump as well); definite contender back up in trip.
