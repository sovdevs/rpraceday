🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat the very useful Cardcounter by 5l in a point, hacked up at Gowran, strong prospects
🔦 Spotlight: Beat the very useful Cardcounter by 5l in a Curraghmore point-to-point last October; hacked up at Gowran, beating another point winner by 9l, with subsequent Limerick runner-up Powerful Paddy beaten 27l in fourth; Patrick Mullins prefers to Limerick winner Dani Donadoni.
Horse quote: 2025-03-08 at Gowran Park (18f): "Ksar Fatal is by Buck's Boum, same sire as Al Boum Photo and has a similar trait in that he gallops and jumps very well at home. He's a staying type. Conditions were very tough and I'm very pleased with him. The ground wasn't a worry going into today. It's nice to win the Doc's bumper with all his family here. I'd imagine we'll give him another run before the end of the season. He's not a big, heavy horse so I'd be happy to run him on better ground - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: E200,000 purchase after Irish point win, ran a cracking race when fifth at Cheltenham
🔦 Spotlight: Recruited for E200,000 after winning a point for the influential Sean Doyle last April; won easily at Newbury (good) and held his own in the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham, finishing a 5l fifth but unlucky not to be closer (met with late interference); missed an engagement at Aintree; renews Cheltenham rivalry with He Can't Dance.
Horse quote: 2024-11-07 at Newbury (16.5f): "El Cairos was impressive and he's a nice horse. He's always shown that at home, but the proof is in the pudding here today and it was a rare turn of foot - Gary Moore, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairyhouse winner, confirmed a good standard of form with Aintree third, Kilwaughter sixth
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner last season; 7l bumper winner at Fairyhouse on stable debut; Leopardstown run at Christmas was a shade disappointing; more like it when fourth at DRF, only a neck behind stablemate He Can't Dance; confirmed a good standard of form with third placing at Aintree, in front of Kilwaughter (sixth) who met trouble.
Horse quote: 2024-12-01 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "I'd say Koktail Brut is a nice horse. We thought we had a few nice ones at home and that was a good performance. He's a bit faster than his half-brother Gevrey and shows a bit of class. I'd imagine we'll look for a Graded bumper - Gordon Elliott, trainer"

💬 Comment: Odds-on winner on debut at Limerick, raced keenly and has potential for improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Odds-on winner on debut at Limerick, beating today's rival Powerful Paddy handsomely; raced keenly and has potential for improvement with the experience under her belt; however, no surprise that Patrick Mullins has rejected her in favour of the exciting Ksar Fatal.
Horse quote: 2025-04-01 at Limerick (19f): "He was very keen and I thought that it would affect Dani Donadoni at the end but I let him catch his breath coming down the hill. I thought I was beaten but once he caught his second wind, he has flown. With the experience under his belt there could be a lot of improvement. It is great for his owner/breeder Kevin McCarthy who has had horses with us for decades, going back to Dani California who won an Irish Cesarewitch - Patrick Mullins, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-12-07 at Navan (16f): "He Can't Dance is a big galloper. He's better than that, they just didn't go much of a gallop. He will be a nice horse - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

💬 Comment: Newbury third suggests Plumpton winner has improved since running twice in Irish bumpers
🔦 Spotlight: First bumper run in Ireland was better than the second; won at Plumpton on British debut, beating a mare who won her next two races and finished third to the Irish-trained Seo Linn at Aintree; coped well with the step ⬆️ up in class when third to the still-unbeaten Sober Glory in a Listed bumper at Newbury.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Leopardstown winner, remote fifth in this race last year, fell three out on hurdling debut
🔦 Spotlight: Leopardstown winner at Christmas fixture in 2023; remote fifth in this race last year; 8-1, fell three out on hurdling debut in a strong maiden at Leopardstown last Christmas.
Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Leopardstown (16f): "Goldinthemountains is a lovely tempered horse, you could ride him up through the crowd there and he wouldn't pay a blind bit of notice. He just has a good mind. He'll like a bit of nicer ground as well. He jumps really well, he has schooled over hurdles and fences, and he'll be a nice one to look forward to next year for hurdling. He might run in another bumper in the spring at Punchestown or here. He's not a typical bumper horse, he's just a good galloping horse and I'd say the further he goes the better he'll be - Martin Brassil, trainer."
