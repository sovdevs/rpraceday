🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark when dropped back in trip and making all in a first-time visor (retained) at Newcastle (5f, AW) in March; up 7lb and needs to prove himself on turf but he did it in convincing fashion and could have more to offer now things have clicked.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made it 0-7 with 5l second on reappearance at Newcastle but could build on that run today
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 0-7 when no match for winning stablemate at Newcastle (6f, AW) three weeks ago but that second placing was still a pretty encouraging reappearance performance and he could build on it today.
