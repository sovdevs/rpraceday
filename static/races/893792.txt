🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid 1m winner on turf debut; form worked out; up just 4lb; interesting back at 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Well connected and although his AW form was modest it was a different story on turf debut at Yarmouth (1m, good) when despite being denied the run he wanted he found a bright finish to beat one who landed a four-timer after; interesting back at 7f off just 4lb higher.

💬 Comment: Looked promising when 6f winner latest; finished strongly so worth another go at 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Looked a sprinter to follow when a ready winner of second 3yo start, at Hamilton (6f, good to firm) recently but the way he coped with that stiff finish suggests he should be effective back at 7f too; dangerous.

🔦 Spotlight: Has yet to prove stamina for this far but he's been running well in 6f handicaps this year and did good late work behind the front-running winner here (good to firm) last month; perhaps this trip will suit with another winter under his belt; has a part to play.
