🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made a winning debut in 1m maiden at Newmarket; has major potential judged on breeding
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning debut in 1m maiden at the Newmarket Craven meeting (good to soft) and has major potential judged on pedigree, being half-sister to her yard's 2,000 Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes winner Coroebus; respected.
Horse quote: 2025-04-15 at Newmarket (8f): "That was her first time on the track and Victory Queen was learning on the job a bit, but she did it quite smoothly. On this ground I think having a run was an advantage, so hopefully she will improve a bit for it. We will find another novice for her and creep away and see how we go - Alex Merriam, trainer's assistant."

🔦 Spotlight: 200,000gns foal; backed into joint-favouritism and caught the eye in 7f maiden at last year's Doncaster St Leger meeting (good), faring best of the newcomers and beating all bar a subsequent Group 3 scorer; seems sure to win races this term.
