🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Touched off in listed h'cap at Punchestown in May, off since, may need this, check market
🔦 Spotlight: Won a nice pot at Navan in March 2023 off 107; only ran three times last season and was touched off in a Listed handicap chase at Punchestown off 124 on his final start of the campaign in May; off since, raised 3lb and has tended to need his comeback runs in the past; market should reveal plenty.

🔦 Spotlight: Benefitted from a drop back in trip to score by 10l off 97 at Punchestown (19.5f, soft) last month; hit with an 8lb rise for that easy win and steps up in grade into a much tougher race; another career best will be required but he's only a 6yo so that is not impossible.

🔦 Spotlight: 3-20 over hurdles; has finished second in two of his three chases, including on latest at Punchestown (22.5f, soft) after a 400 day absence; raised 4lb for that 3l defeat and Darragh O'Keefe takes over from an inexperienced 7lb claimer; will be sharper for that run, the drop in trip is fine and he makes the shortlist.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fine effort at Fairyhouse, step up in trip a plus, could go well in first-time tongue tie
🔦 Spotlight: 2-17 over fences; pulled up on his seasonal return at Navan in December but much more like it when a 3l third of 10 at Fairyhouse (2m1f, soft) last time out when denied a clear run; the step up to 2m4f will suit and if the first-time tongue tie ekes out a bit more he could go well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beginners chase winner, form tailed off last season, improve for comeback, chance if stays
🔦 Spotlight: 1-6 over fences; won a beginners at Thurles (18.5f, soft) in November 2023; ran well in his first two handicap chases at Thurles and off this mark at Fairyhouse but form tailed off last season; should strip fitter for his return at Fairyhouse but has to prove he stays this far; chance if he does.
