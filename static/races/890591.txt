💬 Comment: Scored at Warwick when upped to 3m2f last month and is also suited by this track; a player
🔦 Spotlight: Evidently well suited by step up in trip when scoring at Warwick (3m2f, good) last month and now 2-10 over hurdles; 5lb rise probably doesn't leave him with much margin for error, but he ran well on his only previous visit to Huntingdon and ought to be on the premises again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won five-runner C&D contest eight days ago, his third course success; obvious contender
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to form with C&D (good) win in five-runner contest eight days ago, his third course victory; not always one to rely upon heavily but still feature prominently in calculations.
Horse quote: 2023-02-09 at Huntingdon (25f): "We were despairing of The Wise Traveller last year and nearly sent him to the sales but this year he's done nothing but improve. It was a low-grade race but he did it well - Charlie Longsdon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yet to build upon pleasing stable debut in February but worth another go at a staying trip
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable second on stable debut at Chepstow (2m3f, soft; race worked out well) in February; not quite in same form since but didn't run badly at Fontwell (2m5f, good) three weeks ago and looks well worth another crack at a staying trip; might be the answer.
Horse quote: 2024-01-28 at Fontwell (22f): "Bobalot reverted back to hurdles after not enjoying jumping fences. He's got a Flat pedigree, so he appreciated that drop to them and he's well handicapped over hurdles. We knew if he was happy over them then he should run well and Tom [Bellamy] gave him a great ride - Ben Clarke, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Regressive 10yo who needs to turn a corner
🔦 Spotlight: Regressive 10yo who has largely been disappointing this season and remains without a win since January 2023; too well handicapped to rule out but needs to turn a corner.
Horse quote: 2023-01-28 at Doncaster (19.5f): "We've sweetened Good Bye up since we got him and he was amazing today - he didn't used to go past horses and that's the first time he's wanted to go on his own in front. Sara Ender, trainer."
