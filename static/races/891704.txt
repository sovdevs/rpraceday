🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good record here (won the last three of his four visits) bolsters his chance today
🔦 Spotlight: Won small-field hunter chases on good ground at Catterick (3m1f) and Ludlow (2m4f) last month; lost out to only the odds-on favourite at Kempton (2m4f, good) three weeks ago and, although the scale of his defeat was a bit worrying, his good record here (won the last three of his four visits) bolsters his chance today.
Horse quote: 2021-05-01 at Uttoxeter (24f): "It's a wonderful prize to win and being out of the handicap didn't make a difference. Captain Tommy was fit when we got him and the change of scenery has worked for him - David Bridgewater, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hard to beat on his old form but seemed to lose it completely; has left Dan Skelton
🔦 Spotlight: Career highlight when winning the Becher Chase at Aintree (3m2f, good to soft) in December 2022; pulled up four times in a row in good handicaps before tailing off last March on final outing for Dan Skelton; wore cheekpieces last two starts and has them today; hard to beat on his old form and the betting moves should give clues about what remains.
Horse quote: 2023-01-14 at Warwick (25f): "Fair play to the winner, who we know is really tough. She's gritty and picked up well, but we're not a hurdler. I wanted to run Ashtown Lad because he's been in good form at home and I didn't want to press hard early Feb; I can keep him ticking over now. He didn't quite stay fully from the last, but three miles on this ground over hurdles is a long trip for any horse, which is my only concern if you're going to ask about the National. I still have an unanswered question about that trip. He'll go to Ascot next for a three-mile handicap chase next month - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: It's possible to forgive last two races; form last April-June makes this look manageable
🔦 Spotlight: It's possible to forgive his last two races, as 2m at Leicester was too short and Aintree was always going to be a stiff task; a return to career-best form last April-June when winning two hunter chases and a handicap (2m4f-2m6f) would make this look manageable.
Horse quote: 2024-06-21 at Market Rasen (21.5f): "It was a fair effort. I thought Mr Handicapper was mean putting Yccs Portocervo to a career high, but he's proved that sometimes you have to let the horses do the talking. He's a pleasure to ride and was incredibly game - Sm Twiston-Davies, rider, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair fourth at Southwell early last month would surely not be good enough
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well on sole visit here; made a respectable return to action in December after 581 days off but pulled up next time and fair fourth at Southwell early last month would surely not be good enough.
Horse quote: 2023-04-08 at Haydock (25.5f): "It was obvious what we had to do when Jeffery's Cross was qualified for the race, I had to sit on my hands. It was a bit frustrating having a horse ready to go when the good ground started appearing and he could have been running but it's very important to be fresh with him. Decent ground suits him as well. It was a good pot to win with a horse of that rating. Even if they stick him up 7lb he's still eligible for 0-120s and we'll see where we get to during the summer - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Plenty to prove after latest, even though second of 18 in a Cheltenham handicap in October
🔦 Spotlight: Unseated here in February on hunter chase debut and soundly beaten at Southwell four weeks later; plenty to prove after that, even though he was second of 18 in a Cheltenham handicap (3m1f, good) in October; ridden last four starts by Archie Jones.
Horse quote: 2022-10-21 at Cheltenham (25f): "I was astonished this morning when I saw Jimmy The Digger was 20-1 and then he was backed into 9-1 or whatever, but it was nothing to do with me. We'll go for a similar race next time - he's quite a fun handicap chaser. I don't think he's ground-dependent - Henry Daly, trainer."
