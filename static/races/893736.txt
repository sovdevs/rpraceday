🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Champion stayer bids for third win in this race in the last four years; the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Champion stayer of recent years attempts to win this for the third time in the last four years; unblemished record last season after winning reappearance here, six further wins including at the highest level in Ascot and Goodwood Cups, Irish St Leger and Prix Du Cadran; acts on any going; reportedly in good as form as ever and clearly the one to beat.
Horse quote: 2024-10-19 at Ascot (15.5f): "Kyprios didn't really have much of a race today, he only cantered around but it was the same after his last run in France. He lost no weight and ever since France he's been putting on weight again. He's just an unbelievably classy horse. He loves coming racing and is so laid back. We'll give him the winter off now and then he'll have his two trials [next year] before coming back here for the Gold Cup. That's what we're working towards - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrowly beaten in C&D handicap early this month; can continue to improve
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo won last two starts last year over 1m4f in Roscommon maiden and Bellewstown handicap, reappearing with better effort again over C&D early this month, finding plenty for pressure from some way out when beaten a neck; upped in grade but looks the type to keep improving and could run well.
Horse quote: 2024-10-03 at Bellewstown (12f): "Poetic Sound is a gorgeous horse. He was lost halfway through at Roscommon last time but he travelled better today, so he's learning on the job. Hopefully we'll have one more run before we put him away and we'll look forward to next year with him. I'd say even a mile and six is his minimum trip. We could go to the November Handicap but we'll see if he's street smart enough for that - Ger Lyons, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Curragh handicap winner with likely more to come; big ask though
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo won Down Royal maiden on seasonal return last May but not seen after being placed in Roscommon handicap until returning much improved last month when making all in 1m4f Curragh handicap on soft; quite likely more to come as he steps up further in trip but this looks a tough ask.
Horse quote: 2025-03-29 at Curragh (12f): "Leinster had a real nice run at Roscommon and had a setback so it was unfortunate he missed the rest of the season. Hopefully he can be a progressive stayer. He looked at Roscommon as if the trip was a bit short for him so we were looking forward to stepping him up and I don't think stamina will be any issue to him going forward. The form of the Roscommon race was strong and he handles soft ground well - Joseph O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Group 3 winner last autumn; poor comeback run and McMonagle now prefers Leinster
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile dual-purpose sort whose best flat performances came when winning Queen Alexandra in 2023 and Group 3 Loughbrown Stakes (Curragh) last November; never sighted on last month's seasonal return over inadequate trip in Naas Listed and McMonagle prefers Leinster.
Horse quote: 2024-11-03 at Curragh (16.5f): "Dawn Rising came on the bridle with me from about halfway and he was loving it. I was able to mooch away down the centre in the straight. It took him a while to get to Gavin but he was finding plenty for me and I knew I was always going to get there - Dylan Browne McMonagle, rider"

💬 Comment: Naas comeback run augurs well; nice weight allowance, could sneak a place
🔦 Spotlight: Pick of eight flat wins came in Gowran Listed over this trip last May for Shark Hanlon; took his mark to a new high on seasonal return for current yard last month in finishing staying on second in Naas Listed over inadequate 1m2f; enjoys a nice weight allowance, could sneak a place.
Horse quote: 2023-08-05 at Galway (17f): "Enfranchise had a run here during the week and it made a big difference. I think she's very smart. I have her entered in the Ebor but she might not get in - Shark Hanlon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Former Irish St Leger winner; very lightly raced in recent years, hard to evaluate
🔦 Spotlight: Irish St Leger and Ebor winner in 2021 for Johnny Murtagh but absent since finishing second in Group 3 Riyadh contest in Saudi Arabia in February 2022 until never competitive sixth in Curragh amateur race last October, first start for current yard; hard what to make of him at this stage.
Horse quote: 2021-09-12 at Curragh (14f): "Sonnyboyliston never disappoints and I thought he did very well to win today. It looked like a proper race and he had a good position all the way. He comes off the bridle but I thought from two furlongs out Ben looked confident on him. He got in a battle but he never lacks in a battle - Johnny Murtagh, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive last year but faces stiffest task yet here
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive 3yo last year, winning Fairyhouse handicap and acquitted himself well when raised in class, notably close third in Leopardstown Listed over 1m6f; ran well over an inadequate trip at Dundalk in February and more expected back up in trip but big task on here.

💬 Comment: Has come up short in stakes company before and again looks up against it here
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins have come over C&D, including off 77 last May; rating took a steep rise following two runs in France in the autumn and okay C&D comeback run early this month off revised mark; visor now replaces cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2024-05-07 at Navan (14f): "Bay Of Sanibel was unlucky last time but she really ground it out here. The cheekpieces really helped her. We might try and find another handicap before we go into stakes company - Kate Harrington, assistant trainer."
