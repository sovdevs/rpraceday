🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Clearcut win from out of the weights at Plumpton; 🔥 big player again off 4lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who made her breakthrough over fences (tenth attempt) when scoring from 7lb out of the weights at Plumpton (2m1f, soft) last month; 4lb higher here but she hit a personal best last time and her confidence should be boosted after that clearcut win; key player.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a C&D handicap (good to soft) in November 2023; had a couple of close seconds in five runs since and he was always on the back foot after getting hampered early on at Huntingdon (2m4f) two weeks ago; looks on workable mark on this drop back in trip and he's in the mix.

🔦 Spotlight: Made it second-time lucky over fences when narrowly beating Superstylin over C&D (soft) on return in November; still looks feasibly treated on that form but he stopped quickly here last time and needs to bounce back after that disappointing run.

🔦 Spotlight: Can see out of only his right eye and all of his runs have been at right-handed tracks; two creditable thirds over hurdles (2m) last winter but he's been pulled up in three of his last six runs and was tailed off on seasonal return at Wincanton last month; now switches to chasing at this left-handed track and he has plenty to prove; one of three runners for the yard.
