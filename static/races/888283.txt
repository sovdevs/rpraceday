🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No win since 2021; close third at Chepstow three starts back is the notable plus point
🔦 Spotlight: Took a big 3m handicap at Haydock in November 2021 but no joy since and he's now a 12yo, absent 573 days before this season and not as good as he was; down the weights too and a close third at Chepstow three starts back is the notable plus point.
