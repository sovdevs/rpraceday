💬 Comment: On losing run but hinted at revival with Musselburgh sixth latest; can make presence felt
🔦 Spotlight: On a long losing run but he hinted at a revival when sixth of 13 in 1m Musselburgh handicap 18 days ago; he can make his presence felt off a 3lb lower mark here.
Horse quote: 2022-04-29 at Goodwood (8f): "Dawn Of Liberation ran so badly at Newmarket last time and nobody could really understand that. He emptied, but was quite free, so a mile might be better for him. He's still a baby and I think Churchill's progeny will just get better as they go on. We thought a lot of him before Newmarket - Paul Roy, owner."
