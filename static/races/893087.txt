🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has run well in two chases over this trip and form of Thurles third has worked out well
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-pointer and winning hurdler has run well in two chase starts over this trip; close third on chase debut at Cork and form of last month's Thurles third has worked out well; brought down at halfway over hurdles last time.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Limerick (21f): "Beggars Rock had a couple of good runs but was getting frustrating. He jumped and travelled today, they stopped and he galloped to the line well - Kevin Sexton, rider."

Horse quote: 2022-10-01 at Gowran Park (20f): "I'm delighted with Wellington Hill. He had a wind op last year and he's had three runs since, he's improved every day since he came back from it.
