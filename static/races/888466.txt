📝 Comment: slowly into stride, 🔄 held up in rear, going okay but still plenty to do over 1f out, ⏳ ran on well inside final furlong, nearest finish (inquiry into running and riding; jockey said her instructions were to jump out and sit where she was happy, before riding the race as she found it; she was content with her position and travelled well off a pace she considered to be just modest; approaching home turn she angled wider around the heels of a rival to avail herself of clear running; however rounding home bend and in early part of straight was a misjudgement of her surroundings and contributed to gelding being left with too much ground to make up; trainer's rep confirmed instructions; trainer was interviewed via phone, where he expressed concern with manner in which gelding was ridden from approximately 2f out until inside final furlong, with gelding being too far out of his ground before being asked to challenge)
