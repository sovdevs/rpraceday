🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form over 7f for 🆕 new yard, particularly on latest; looks worth a go at new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Winning 7f AW debut for previous yard so went handicapping off a high mark; quite promising over 7f for 🆕 new yard, losing his chance at the start at Wolverhampton recently but coming through strongly for a late third in first-time visor; not ruled out on first 6f run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Major 🚀 improver over 6f since back from break; C&D winner latest; up 3lb; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Has come on a ton since back from a break and being fitted with a tongue-tie, winning handsomely in two of his first three 6f starts and looking as though he wasn't done with from a handicapping point of view over C&D last month; major player despite further 3lb rise.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two of four AW wins over C&D; in good form but not obviously ahead of his mark
🔦 Spotlight: Two of four AW wins have come over C&D; in good form this winter, ending a losing run at Newcastle (5f) two starts ago and another solid effort there since (similar chance to El Bufalo); should give his running back at 6f without being ahead of his mark now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lingfield 6f winner in January; faded there last week but interesting on the earlier form
🔦 Spotlight: In fine form this winter but he didn't find as much in a competitive race at Lingfield (6f; odds-on) 11 days ago as he had when winning over that C&D the time before; that form would give him a serious shout if it can be recaptured.

🔦 Spotlight: Won his maiden over 5f and kept to that trip in recent starts, having failed to sustain his effort in his only 6f handicap, at Southwell in October; has some trip queries to answer.

💬 Comment: C&D winner; last 4 successes over 7f; close 3rd back at 6f latest and in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in late 2023 but four subsequent AW wins were over 7f and he paid the handicapping price for a clearcut Wolverhampton win in September; suffered no inconvenience for the return to 6f there 12 days ago, when a close third, and should be in the mix again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Major 🚀 improver over 6f since back from break; C&D winner latest; up 3lb; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Has come on a ton since back from a break and being fitted with a tongue-tie, winning handsomely in two of his first three 6f starts and looking as though he wasn't done with from a handicapping point of view over C&D last month; major player despite further 3lb rise.

💬 Comment: Two of four AW wins over C&D; in good form but not obviously ahead of his mark
🔦 Spotlight: Two of four AW wins have come over C&D; in good form this winter, ending a losing run at Newcastle (5f) two starts ago and another solid effort there since (similar chance to El Bufalo); should give his running back at 6f without being ahead of his mark now.

💬 Comment: C&D winner; last 4 successes over 7f; close 3rd back at 6f latest and in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in late 2023 but four subsequent AW wins were over 7f and he paid the handicapping price for a clearcut Wolverhampton win in September; suffered no inconvenience for the return to 6f there 12 days ago, when a close third, and should be in the mix again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lingfield 6f winner in January; faded there last week but interesting on the earlier form
🔦 Spotlight: In fine form this winter but he didn't find as much in a competitive race at Lingfield (6f; odds-on) 11 days ago as he had when winning over that C&D the time before; that form would give him a serious shout if it can be recaptured.

📝 Comment: took keen hold, 🔄 held up in rear, drifted right and ⚠️ not clear run over 1f out, switched left and no impression inside final furlong (jockey said, regarding running and riding, his instructions were to take his time and get gelding to settle, having ran too freely over 5f on his last run and get gelding to finish his race off, he explained that gelding again ran keenly despite his best efforts to switch gelding off in early stages; he considered the pace to have been strong initially but it steadied up leaving back straight, whereupon he found himself following and not being taken forward into race; he further explained that once others improved around his outside and another arrived down his inner he was left with limited option but to continue following which caused him to lose ground and be on the back foot with a view to mounting his challenge; thereafter once availing himself of clear running inside 1 1/2f out, he gave gelding a hands and heels ride to line and stayed on fairly from that point, albeit from an unpromising position; he added that he felt gelding would come on for the run but would be recommending gelding should remain racing over 5-6f but would be better suited by a strong pace and perhaps a more galloping track, which was noted)

🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner in late 2023 but four subsequent AW wins were over 7f and he paid the handicapping price for a clearcut Wolverhampton win in September; suffered no inconvenience for the return to 6f there 12 days ago, when a close third, and should be in the mix again.

🔦 Spotlight: Winning 7f AW debut for previous yard so went handicapping off a high mark; quite promising over 7f for 🆕 new yard, losing his chance at the start at Wolverhampton recently but coming through strongly for a late third in first-time visor; not ruled out on first 6f run.

🔦 Spotlight: In fine form this winter but he didn't find as much in a competitive race at Lingfield (6f; odds-on) 11 days ago as he had when winning over that C&D the time before; that form would give him a serious shout if it can be recaptured.

🔦 Spotlight: Two of four AW wins have come over C&D; in good form this winter, ending a losing run at Newcastle (5f) two starts ago and another solid effort there since (similar chance to El Bufalo); should give his running back at 6f without being ahead of his mark now.

🔦 Spotlight: Two 6f AW wins for previous yard last winter but it hasn't been easy since winning for this one at Newmarket in August and, after getting closer at Wolverhampton last month, things never went his way from a wide draw at Southwell; needs more weight off his back.

🔦 Spotlight: Has come on a ton since back from a break and being fitted with a tongue-tie, winning handsomely in two of his first three 6f starts and looking as though he wasn't done with from a handicapping point of view over C&D last month; major player despite further 3lb rise.
