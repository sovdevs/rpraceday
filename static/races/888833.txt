🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Up 2lb for excellent effort at the DRF, unproven on heavy, chance if she handles it
🔦 Spotlight: One of two for Tom Mullins; 1-14 over hurdles; ran a blinder at big odds when chasing home Vischio at the DRF over 2m2f (soft); up 2lb for that and she has to prove she is effective on heavy ground; place claims at least if she handles conditions.
