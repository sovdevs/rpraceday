Horse quote: 2023-05-12 at Ripon (5f): "He did it well. Reigning Profit broke very quickly so I travelled strongly through the race and I think he was just getting a little tired near the line - James Sullivan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Arrives in form; Lewis Chalkley knows him well; one of the more interesting contenders
🔦 Spotlight: Sole turf win came over C&D (July 2023) and he arrives in good form, having pulled hard from a wide stall and paid for it late over 6f last time; Lewis Chalkley knows him well; one of the more interesting contenders.
Horse quote: 2023-07-03 at Pontefract (5f): "Good ride wasn't it? It's alright having the idea but you've got to follow it through and Shane (Gray) didn't go too fast. When you go out on a limb it's easy to get the fractions wrong and he didn't do that. I think the only reason So Grateful won is because of the tactics we took on, so the handicapper should drop us for that! - David Easterby, joint-trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2023-08-01 at Beverley (5f): "Keldeo has come forward from her debut. She ran a nice race at Catterick but just got tired late. She has a lot of scope and should make a cracking three-year-old too and I'm very hopeful for her future prospects - Ollie Pears, trainer."
