🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked unlucky not to collect over 6f last Sunday on Irish debut, extra furlong will suit
🔦 Spotlight: 2-16 for Richard Hannon, several good runs in defeat last season; made an excellent if luckless start for Ger O'Leary over 6f at the Curragh last Sunday; slowly away and met trouble in running before staying on strongly to get within a head of the well-fancied Laugh A Minute; strong chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Apparently unfancied (28-1) when third at Dundalk on her first try at 7f, definite chance
🔦 Spotlight: 6f Dundalk maiden winner last April would have been closer in a Cork Listed the following month had she enjoyed a clear run; bought out of Paddy Twomey's yard for 25,000euros in November; has run twice at Dundalk; seemed to be completely unfancied when a promising third on her first try at this trip; definite chance.
