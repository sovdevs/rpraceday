💬 Comment: Hood added and the drop to 2m should suit; solid chance if jumping better than debut
🔦 Spotlight: Course bumper winner in January disappointed in that sphere next time after doing too much in front; made some mistakes on hurdling debut over 2m4f at this track last time but still a fine effort; hood added and the drop to 2m should suit; solid chance if jumping better.

Horse quote: 2022-02-12 at Naas (15.5f): "Icare D'Aubrelle has a great constitution for work, he has a great body and you can throw anything at him and it doesn't matter to him. He's not a horse that needs time, he's just a racehorse and I'm lucky to have him - Tom Cooper, trainer."
