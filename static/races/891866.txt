🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed and 📈 progressive over 6f in a visor; yard in form; holds strong claims
🔦 Spotlight: The addition of a visor and returning to 6f has turned things around, with a win at Newcastle in December before he bumped into one that was even further ahead of her mark in early January; back from three months off with an easy Southwell win four weeks ago; strong claims for an in-form stable.

Horse quote: 2022-07-22 at Cork (5f): "He is an improving horse and has improved from every run. Seamie said he never had a moment's worry and was a winner all the way. Kodi Red is a lovely horse, we're not sure where we go next but he is for sale - Adrian Murray, trainer."
