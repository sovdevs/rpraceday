🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Leger hero with likely a Cup campaign in mind but could still take plenty of beating
🔦 Spotlight: Unbeaten in four starts last season, twice over C&D; won Group 2 Gordon Stakes at Goodwood; found the required stamina reserves to see off stablemate Illinois in 1m6f St Leger at Doncaster in September on good; staying campaign likely this season but begins at this shorter trip and Ryan Moore rides.
Horse quote: 2024-09-14 at Doncaster (14.5f): "We knew the track would suit and the trip would suit. I think Jan Brueghel showed he's successful going that extra distance and I think he's a Gold Cup horse in the making. Don't be surprised if he steps up a bit next year, But he has a bit of class and he's done that really well - Sean Levey, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never stopped improving last year as a 6yo; ground and likely strong pace to suit
🔦 Spotlight: Never stopped improving last year as a 6yo, winning all four starts; twice in handicaps here and when upped to 1m4f, landing Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes at Ascot and Group 3 Ballyroan Stakes at Leopardstown in ready fashion; subsequent Melbourne Cup bid never materialised and intriguing runner here on favoured ground with the likely true test in his favour.
Horse quote: 2024-08-08 at Leopardstown (12f): "Crystal Black relaxed and switched off better than I thought he would, quickened up and got there sooner than I wanted. He was inclined to go a bit left towards the rail but once against the rail he went true to the line. The aim is the Melbourne Cup - Colin Keane, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Stayer; likely to be most inconvenienced of the Ballydoyle trio dropped in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Well-travelled last year, recording big-money wins from off the pace at Riyadh (1m7f) and Meydan (2m) earlier in the year and returned in mid-summer to win Group 2 Curragh Cup over 1m6f (good); likely to be most inconvenienced of the Ballydoyle trio dropped in trip.
Horse quote: 2024-07-20 at Curragh (14f): "Tower Of London stays well, has got a great cruising speed and is able to quicken. He's a very good horse and can travel anywhere. We might look to space out his runs a bit and he could be back here for the Irish St Leger. He could be a Melbourne Cup horse - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Both wins last year came at 1m but came up short in Group company; fair form in Meydan early this year but needs to improve a fair bit to play a role here; cheekpieces tried and appears the yard's first-choice.
Horse quote: 2024-07-15 at Killarney (8f): "We couldn't have been more pleased that that. We jumped and I let Galen swing along, good even fractions the whole way and from the top of the straight I let him stretch. He was strong through line. He's going the right way and only going to get better. The ground was a big help, he's a really good mover - Dylan Browne McMonagle, jockey, speaking to Racing TV"

💬 Comment: Fair form in Meydan early this year but needs to improve a fair bit; cheekpieces tried
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins last year came at 1m but came up short in Group company; fair form in Meydan early this year but needs to improve a fair bit to play a role here; cheekpieces tried and appears the yard's first-choice.

Horse quote: 2023-10-07 at Newmarket (7f): "I was expecting Sons And Lovers to finish in the first three. He is a lovely horse. He is still a bit raw and he has got bit of maturing to do. He is a lovely mover but I was worried the ground might be too quick - Jane Chapple-Hyam, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-09-24 at Curragh (8f): "Crypto Force is a very exciting horse for next year. Colin thinks he will be better on fast ground, he will have no trouble getting 1m2f but on quicker ground he will have just that bit more pace.
