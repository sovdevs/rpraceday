🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Solid record for Andrew Balding and he looks interesting back in a handicap for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Had form figures of 2221442 (the win achieved when the first past the post was disqualified on a technicality) for Andrew Balding and was been beaten less than 2l in his final three runs in the autumn; changed hands for 28,000gns in October; interesting contender back in a handicap.

💬 Comment: On long losing run but he went close at Musselburgh on penultimate run; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: On long losing run and was well held when favourite at Musselburgh two weeks ago but he rallied well to go close there (7f, good) on his penultimate run; has possibilities if he can recapture that form and he's still lightly raced on AW.

💬 Comment: Flopped at Southwell latest but has form figures of 14122322 here since January; respected
🔦 Spotlight: All four wins have been at this track including two over C&D in January; flopped at Southwell last month but he now returns to his favoured course and he had a near-miss here (1m) on his penultimate run; 🔥 big player if he can bounce back near best.
Horse quote: 2023-10-09 at Pontefract (8f): "Tasever ran a blinder too and I hope he'll get his win soon - Tim Easterby, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual course winner and he ran well on seasonal return last year; one to keep an eye on
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't fire here in his final two runs last year but both wins have come at Newcastle and latest was over C&D in October; still looks feasibly treated on that form and he ran well on his seasonal return last spring; one to keep an eye on.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D win in March and was long way out of the weights latest; in the mix back down in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Came from off the pace when scoring in good style over C&D in March; held in two runs here since but latest was a creditable effort from a long way out the weights in a valuable handicap; back on correct mark here and she's in the mix on this big drop back in grade.
Horse quote: 2023-03-09 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "Too Much has done it nicely and hopefully she can progress. I don't think she's going to be a superstar but she's honest and tries hard so hopefully we can get another couple of numbers out of her - PJ McDonald, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: On dangerous mark but he needs a major revival with cheekpieces added
🔦 Spotlight: Course winner, who won two in a row over 7f on turf last summer; looks interesting on that form but he's not been at full power this year and he was beaten 11l at Doncaster (7f, good) last time; cheekpieces are now added and he needs a major revival.
