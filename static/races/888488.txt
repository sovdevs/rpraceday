💬 Comment: Often on the premises; unraced beyond 1m4f on Flat; 0-31 record is a disincentive
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up three times in the autumn and, following wind surgery, he's been on the premises again on last two outings; all those were over 1m2f-1m4f on Tapeta and he's never raced beyond that on Flat; for all his minor honours, his 0-31 record is a disincentive.

🔦 Spotlight: 4lb lower than when off the mark at Lingfield (2m, good to firm) last July in first-time cheekpieces; a notch or two below that form in recent months, with 🆕 new yard on last four outings, but she was close up when third at Wolverhampton (1m6f) nine days ago in first-time blinkers; each-way chance.
