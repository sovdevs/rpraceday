🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well-backed winning debut in Wexford bumper 11 months ago; interesting on hurdles debut
🔦 Spotlight: Half-sister to winners Looksnowtlikebrian (useful 2m3f-3m2f hurdle/chase) and Rivabodiva (2m7f/3m hurdle); dam 2m3f-3m hurdle/chase winner; justified good market support on debut in 2m Wexford mares bumper (soft) 11 months ago, despite trouble in running; second has done her bit for the form and interesting now switched to hurdles (clearly runs well fresh); longer trip to suit.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flat winner; eyecatching hurdles debut at Leopardstown last month; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Former German-trained mare; 1m2f winner in France; unplaced all eight runs in stakes races; encouraging hurdles debut when staying on fourth in decent 2m4f Leopardstown mares maiden last month (yielding); probably won't need to improve too much to play a leading role here.

🔦 Spotlight: Some decent runs in bumpers, including second at Killarney last summer (good) and when last seen at Galway in October on similar ground; withdrawn once on soft ground so ground doesn't look ideal.

💬 Comment: Recent 3m Limerick efforts give her place claims at least
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in 2m5f Wexford mares maiden for Sam Curling two seasons back and having returned from best part of two year's absence, good effort on second run back when chasing home an all-the-way winner over 3m at Limerick last month; not quite at that level when fourth in similar contest since but place claims here.
