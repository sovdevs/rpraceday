🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ended 2024 in good form & running well this year too; close 2nd (6f) last week; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Ended 2024 in good form and he's carried on the good work this year, beating Toca Madera at Newmarket last month and then going down narrowly over 6f here last week; good chance off the same mark with Oisin Murphy retaining the ride.
Horse quote: 2025-04-17 at Newmarket (5f): "Regal Envoy enjoyed the fast pace and the track and trip suited him. He likes five furlongs or six around a bend but I don't know where we are going next - William Knight, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2 good runs this year, including 3rd of 17 at York last week; solid claims in weaker race
🔦 Spotlight: 6f win here last summer (good to firm) off 1lb lower; two good runs this season sandwich a lesser effort at Goodwood, the latest when third of 17 at York last week (5f, good to firm); off the bridle some way out but stuck on well on that occasion and this isn't so demanding; serious contender.
Horse quote: 2023-06-09 at Bath (5.5f): "Toca Madera had done everything right first time, and was a little bit unlucky, but he did that well. We'll see how he comes out of it. He didn't like the ground but Kieran was very complimentary, saying he'll be better on much better ground. With rain round the corner Royal Ascot is a possibility - Brian Meehan, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form and on a handy mark; sure to run well but not easy to win with
🔦 Spotlight: On a long losing run but he retains a good deal of ability and has run a string of good races in defeat this year, most recently when second of seven at Goodwood 17 days ago (5f, good; solid form); possibly hit the front too soon there and a 1lb rise is no issue but he usually manages to find a way of getting beaten.
Horse quote: 2022-04-30 at Newmarket (5f): "Existent is a nice straightforward horse to deal with and hopefully he will now go on to the King's Stand Stakes. Tom (Morley, owner) and his mum have won the race twice before and we entered him for it last week. It is a bit of an ask, being rated 101, but we think he definitely warranted an entry and I think it should suit him. I think five is his best trip for us - Stuart Williams, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chasing a hat-trick and latest AW win represented another career best; stable run two here
🔦 Spotlight: Gained his first turf success when scoring at Nottingham (5f, good) last month and followed up at Southwell three weeks ago, producing a career-best effort in the process; 3lb rise not excessive and although this is a step ⬆️ up in class, he can't be discounted in his current form; stable also run Rhythm N Hooves.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: String of good runs, AW and turf, in 2025; each-way claims once more
🔦 Spotlight: He's been in good form since returning to action in December, winning twice at Southwell and running well in defeat the last twice (turf latest); Rossa Ryan booked and each-way claims again.
Horse quote: 2023-06-23 at Ascot (5f): "Rhythm N Hooves was inexperienced coming into this, it was only his fifth race. He learnt a lot at York the last day, that was a big shock for him going from all-weather novices through to these 20, 25-runner handicaps. He has obviously shown a high level of ability here, so hopefully we can either go to more of these high-grade handicaps, but I wouldn't put it past going for a Listed race maybe with him at some point - Archie Watson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Group 3 wins for M O'Callaghan; makes stable debut off a reduced mark; check betting
🔦 Spotlight: Won the Group 3 Cornwallis Stakes as a 2yo; regularly ran well in the face of stiff tasks last season and he starts out for his new stable off an 8lb lower mark than when last tackling a handicap; worth a 📊 market check.
Horse quote: 2023-09-03 at Tipperary (5f): "It's a very sharp five at Tipperary, hence the headgear, but it kept Twilight Jet concentrated. We'd lots of dreams and aspirations after he won the Lacken but  he was very sick after Ascot, then had colic surgery since and later slipped on a hard surface so needed surgery on his hock. This year was race to race so and he had a good blow afterwards. The headgear may stay on. He could go to Newbury or further afield in the coming months and may stay in training - Michael O'Callaghan, trainer."
