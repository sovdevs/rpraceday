🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off the mark in second maiden at the Curragh, soft ground a query, chance if handles it
🔦 Spotlight: Built on debut promise over 7f at the Curragh when winning second time out upped to 1m; both those runs came on quick ground and it remains to be seen if he'll be as effective on this softer ground; obvious chance if he does act on it.

💬 Comment: Maiden winner at Tipperary, struggled upped in class since, soft ground an unknown, watch
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 7.5f maiden on good ground at Tipperary last September; failed to fire upped in class at Chantilly and was well beaten here over 7f in the valuable Auction Series Final, his sole start on softer than good; preferred by Browne-McMonagle but probably best watched for now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won an AW maiden in February, fit from the flat, yard in form, may want better ground
🔦 Spotlight: Midfield on heavy at Galway on debut last October over 7.5f; much better switched to the AW, landing a 7f maiden by 2.75l at Dundalk; not disgraced in a decent contest back there on latest but whether she'll act on this softer surface is up for debate.
