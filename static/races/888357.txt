🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fended off 🔍 unexposed/well-backed rival to open account last month; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Went close at Doncaster (2m3f, good to soft) in January, after a break, and was always doing enough to fend off an 🔍 unexposed/well-backed rival at Ludlow (2m5f, soft; front pair clear) last month; should be fine on today's faster ground and could still be well treated after latest 6lb rise.

🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles at 11th attempt, dominating from the front at Fakenham (2m7f, good) in January; did not see his race out when back at Fakenham last month but is probably still on a workable mark.

💬 Comment: Made the frame in her first two handicaps but her form is quite tricky to evaluate
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 10yo; made the frame in first two handicaps but was remote when second on the first occasion and her subsequent third of five over C&D (heavy) came in a tactical race; unraced on ground quicker than good to soft and remains quite tricky to evaluate.
