🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🚀 improver who has won here in his last four starts; 🔥 big player under another penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Has won six times on AW since December, including at this track in his last four starts; has a penalty for his narrow success over C&D last Monday but he reeled in a well-handicapped rival and this tough 4yo is open to more progress; key player.

💬 Comment: Last win was in Germany in 2023 and he needs to find more back up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Useful in Germany in his youth but failed to win in 13 starts for Charlie Fellowes and was a well-held third on recent stable debut at Southwell (7f, Tapeta); that was after a break and this return to 1m is no problem but others are more convincing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On dangerous mark and he caught the eye of the stewards at Southwell last time; in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Justified favouritism in 9.4f handicap here for Marco Botti last February; hasn't matched that since but he caught the eye of the stewards at Southwell (1m3f) last time and is now 3lb lower than for his win; could be dangerous back in trip.
