🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Front-running 2nd on Southwell handicap debut (3m, good to soft; favourite) six days ago
🔦 Spotlight: Good-ground point winner one year ago; showed ability in his last two hurdle races, last time when front-running second of nine on handicap debut at Southwell (3m, good to soft; favourite) six days ago under Callum Pritchard; needs to build on that but early days, so he may do so.

💬 Comment: Won stable debut at Huntingdon (3m2f) when wearing a first-time visor after wind surgery
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who snapped a long losing sequence on this month's stable debut at Huntingdon (3m2f, good to soft) when wearing a first-time visor (retained) on his first outing since wind surgery; 4lb higher today but could have more to offer for this yard; should be major player.

💬 Comment: 33-1 win from the front over hurdles at Chepstow (3m, soft); remote 3rd over fences latest
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time chase winner (once over 3m here) who shot back to form with a 33-1 win from the front over hurdles at Chepstow (3m, soft; 8lb higher today) last month; remote third when returned to fences 17 days ago, but much more interesting back in this sphere on the recent evidence.
