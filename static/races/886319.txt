📝 Comment: in rear, headway before 2 out, never near to challenge nudged out (an inquiry was held into running and riding; rider and trainer were interviewed; vet examined gelding which was selected for routine testing on two occasions post-race and had nothing to report; having initially failed to report anything when passing scales post-race, jockey said several minutes after having been informed that he was required to attend an inquiry into ride on gelding, that gelding had made a respiratory noise during race; jockey said his instructions were to ride gelding at rear of field, get him settled and creep into race with the aim of making a late challenge as gelding has not been seeing his races out; he continued that gelding jumped and travelled well up until 3rd last fence where it began to make the aforementioned noise; however, it was from this point on that gelding began to make both steady and eyecatching progress under sympathetic handling and jockey justified his apparent lack of effort by reiterating the fact that gelding is a weak finisher, and it was his intention to get there as late as possible for this reason, but on this occasion having jumped the last fence gelding emptied out again; trainer said his instructions were to ride gelding with restraint and to get there late; having become aware of the respiratory noise trainer said that he was satisfied with ride and that he would have gelding seen by a vet regarding his  respiratory issue;)
