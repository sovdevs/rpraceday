💬 Comment: Promising 7th in the Brocklesby; made all at Kempton latest but demoted to 2nd; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Promising seventh, beaten under 3l, in the Brocklesby on debut; showed bright speed when making all the running at Kempton two weeks ago but he hung left in the straight and the interference he caused the runner-up was deemed significant enough to reverse the placings; effectively a winner without a penalty and his early pace will be an asset; solid contender.
