🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all at Beverley recently but this race may not pan out so favourably
🔦 Spotlight: Built upon encouraging seasonal debut when making all in six-runner race at Beverley (1m2f, good) last month; nudged up only 2lb for that but this race may not pan out so favourably for him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unlucky not to finish closer than sixth in higher-grade race recent; can go very well here
🔦 Spotlight: Nothing like to force of old but unlucky not to finish closer than sixth in 0-85 event at Thirsk (1m4f, good to firm) 12 days ago, denied a clear run, and can go very well off a 2lb lower mark in this grade; cheekpieces (worn twice in 2023 without success) are given another whirl; major shout.
Horse quote: 2021-08-14 at Newbury (7f): "Masekela has a couple of entries in the Champagne Stakes and the Royal Lodge and I need to talk to Andrew, but my view is that a mile is the right distance. William said he's a nice horse and there would be more to come. He said he'd make a nice 3yo, which we always felt as he's a big horse - Mick Mariscotti, owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won three in a row on AW in March/April; now needs to prove he's fully effective on turf
🔦 Spotlight: In excellent form on Tapeta in recent weeks, winning three in a row (1m2f-1m4f) from off the pace; not sure to transfer that improvement back to turf but his running style could make it difficult for the handicapper to get his measure.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Newcastle (AW) (10f): "I just said to James [Callow] the owner there, that I actually thought Jimmy Sullivan had got away on us; he gave his a peach out in front, but Ana Emaraaty did all his best work in the last furlong. He relaxed real good for me early on, so it was perfect. The further he went, the better he went, and I wouldn't be surprised if he got a bit further as well - Paul Mulrennan, jockey speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back in form when placed over hurdles last month; returns to the Flat on workable mark
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran with four Flat wins and eight hurdle wins on his CV; not one to rely upon heavily nowadays but returned to form with pretty good third over hurdles last month and reverts to the Flat on a workable mark.
Horse quote: 2022-03-25 at Musselburgh (17.5f): "The Navigator fell in this race last year and he never really recovered. I deliberately went to Sedgefield because I thought if there was anywhere he could get his confidence back it would be there, and he needed it. He's got a lot of ability, he's a big beautiful horse, he's stunning - Dianne Sayer, trainer."
