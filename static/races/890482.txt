🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Exeter in February and wasn't beaten far at Newbury latest; respected back in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Has form figures of 22414 since returning from a break in October and was only beaten around 3l when a fourth of six at Newbury (2m6f, good to soft) last month; 1lb lower here and he should go well again back in trip for in-form yard.
Horse quote: 2025-02-09 at Exeter (19f): "Sherborne stuck on nicely. We tried him over three miles last time but it ended up being a bog for him, though I do think he'll get further. We targeted this race because it's a lovely pot for a 0-110 and he jumped and travelled. He's a gorgeous horse and we thought he'd be a lot better than this. He's fresh and well, and as the ground gets a bit better we'll step him up in trip - Joe Tizzard, trainer."
