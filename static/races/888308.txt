🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice made all; 2m4f may help to explain the two heavy defeats among her last four starts
🔦 Spotlight: Made all at Southwell last May and Stratford in October, so carries a double penalty today; both were on soft ground but she does have some form on good and good to firm; appearances at about 2m4f may help to explain the two heavy defeats among her last four starts; a leading form contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Irish point; well beaten in bumper and maiden hurdle but pretty useful jumps pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: Won Irish mares' maiden point (3m, good to yielding) on debut last May; well beaten in bumper at Ffos Las (soft) and maiden hurdle at Exeter (good to soft) but has a pretty useful jumps pedigree, so needs a second look.

🔦 Spotlight: Out of a mare who was placed over hurdles in France; modest form last year in bumpers at Worcester (good) in July and Fontwell (good to soft) in September; needs a transformation on hurdle debut.
