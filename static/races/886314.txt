🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not far away in slow-ground chases here the last twice and his mark was left alone
🔦 Spotlight: Mostly disappointing since winning a bumper here in early 2022 but rediscovered some form to be beaten 5l and 6l in 3m2f/3m3f slow-ground chases here the last twice; off an untouched mark he should run well.

🔦 Spotlight: First hurdle win came on soft and the second was on good ground over this sort of trip here last June, after which he went close two days later at Newton Abbot; only 2lb higher than last time but he's steered clear of fences since falling on his debut in this discipline 13 months ago.
