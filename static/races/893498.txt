🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stands out on his AW displays, just a question of whether he can reproduce that form
🔦 Spotlight: Modest form on turf on his first four starts, including when 14th of 16 in a nursery at the Curragh last September; different proposition when switched to AW; fourth in a nursery over this trip on his first Dundalk run, and improved again when scoring over 6f in November; runner-up over 7f in November and again over 6f in January.
Horse quote: 2024-11-06 at Dundalk (AW) (6f): "Tomarlo will actually end up being a nice horse. I think there is a nursery for him here in two weeks' time over five, so we'll see - David Marnane, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Ran green over 7f at the Curragh last August, failed to build on that at Down Royal when dropped in trip; dropped away in the final furlong over 6f at the Curragh on final start; may find her level in handicaps this season.

🔦 Spotlight: Best effort in maidens came on final start last year when mid-division on easy ground; failed to build on that promise on handicap debut over 5f at Naas last month; not disgraced over 6f at the Curragh 12 days ago, had a brief spell in the lead over a furlong out before fading.
