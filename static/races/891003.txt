💬 Comment: Solid form in pattern company for Andre Fabre when last seen in 2023, off 560 days, watch
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 7f maiden on soft at Chantilly for Andre Fabre; ran with credit in listed and group 2 company subsequently at 1m2f-1m4f on ground ranging from soft to good; entitled to need this run after a long layoff so he is probably best watched with a view to future engagements.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Talented mare on her day, has moved yards, likes testing ground, may need further
🔦 Spotlight: Left Shark Hanlon after a below par run in the Irish Cesarewitch; 4-16 on the Flat including a 1m6f listed win on heavy ground at Gowran; she lacks a run and this trip may be on the sharp side for her on her first start for Willie McCreery; watch.

💬 Comment: Gowran maiden winner on good, rated 90, needs to improve plenty to feature here
🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise on debut over 7f at the Curragh and got off the mark second time up in a 9.5f Gowran maiden; no impact in a listed heat on the AW on her final start of 2024; rated 90 and she needs to find a lot of improvement to feature here.
