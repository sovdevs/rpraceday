💬 Comment: 0-25 Flat and hurdling, nearly all for Mark Usher; bits of 2024 form give each-way chance
🔦 Spotlight: 0-25 Flat and hurdling, all for Mark Usher except debut; off since September and although bits of 2024 form give her an each-way chance, they were over shorter; best Flat run last year was over 2m, so perhaps sufficient stamina can come to the fore on this first run for Fergal O'Brien.

💬 Comment: Latest was the best of three runs for yard; this is handicap hurdle debut over a new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Ran for Sir Mark Prescott in three bumpers and eight Flat races, all without winning; Uttoxeter third (2m) over hurdles latest can't be that convincing given that she was beaten 25l, but it was the best of her three runs for this yard and this is her handicap hurdle debut over a new trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chase win in November; returned to hurdles today, in which sphere she has a modest record
🔦 Spotlight: Sole start here (November) saw her well held in third when she ran out at the second-last fence; off the mark at Wincanton (2m4f, good to soft) nine days later and second of five at Taunton (2m2f) next time, but pulling up at Chepstow sees her returned to hurdles today, in which sphere she has a modest record.
