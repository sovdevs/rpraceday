🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First run since being ✂️ gelded when winning over 7f last month; player back at 1m
🔦 Spotlight: Came good on the back of a gelding operation when leading towards the finish over 7f at Kempton last month; the third in that race won next time and he remains of interest after a 3lb rise, particularly as the return to 1m may see him in an even better light.
