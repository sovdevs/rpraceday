🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jumping let him down on recent chase debut, better ground here could see improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner; good runs in defeat over hurdles last season on decent ground but pulled up on heavy ground on yard debut last month; none too fluent and beaten when unseating last on chase debut at Naas since; better ground could well see an improved showing here.
