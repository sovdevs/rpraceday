üí¨ Comment: Runner-up to rejuvenated winner at Wetherby last time and may benefit from the cheekpieces
üî¶ Spotlight: In and out during this novice chase campaign but won at Catterick (3m1f, good to soft) in January and second at Wetherby (3m, soft) last time; the first/third have won since; can run in snatches and may be the type to benefit from the cheekpieces; one to consider from 2lb out of the handicap.
