🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up to rejuvenated winner at Wetherby last time and may benefit from the cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: In and out during this novice chase campaign but won at Catterick (3m1f, good to soft) in January and second at Wetherby (3m, soft) last time; the first/third have won since; can run in snatches and may be the type to benefit from the cheekpieces; one to consider from 2lb out of the handicap.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two-time course winner who arrives on a hat-trick and is firmly in calculations
🔦 Spotlight: Can be inconsistent but he won three in a row in late 2023 (including here) and he arrives on another hat-trick having scored at Musselburgh (2m7f, good) and over C&D (good) the last twice; firmly in calculations.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 6yo who is 2-4; could play leading role if the ground suits (best form on soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 2-3 over fences and in these cheekpieces when scoring by 6l at Sedgefield (3m2f, soft) in January; held in fifth but staying on when falling at the final fence here (2m4f, good to soft) last month; his best form has come on soft going but this 🔍 unexposed 6yo could play a leading role if the ground isn't an issue now back up in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointing here recently but ran well two starts ago; each-way shout if bouncing back
🔦 Spotlight: 15-race maiden who was disappointing here (2m5f, good) a fortnight ago; however, prior to that he was a good second of four at Ayr when wearing first-time blinkers (retained since) on his first crack at 3m (soft), and he's run well here in the past; each-way shout if bouncing back to form.

🔦 Spotlight: Even from out of the handicap he's running off a mark 4lb lower than when winning over C&D last March; ran his best race since when fourth over C&D (good) a fortnight ago in first-time blinkers but this 11yo needs to build on that latest performance to make an impact today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10yo who has run well on his last two completed starts and could be involved
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Musselburgh (2m7f, good to soft) in December and another good run when second of 13 at Catterick in January (3m1f, good; albeit no match for the winner); mid-race faller last time; this 10yo could be involved.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 11yo who has struggled this term but worth a second look given previous form in this race
🔦 Spotlight: 11yo for whom good runs are scarce nowadays and he's struggled this term; however, high points in each of the last two seasons have come in this race, winning it in 2023 and finishing a close third last year, and he's well treated on that form even from out of the weights; no forlorn hope.

💬 Comment: Won at Newcastle in January but pulled up at Ayr since
🔦 Spotlight: Stayed on well to win at Newcastle (2m4f, good to soft) in January on second start back from a long absence; not written off after just one poor run but he has something to prove after being pulled up at Ayr (3m, good to soft) last month, and he's 4lb out of the handicap today.
