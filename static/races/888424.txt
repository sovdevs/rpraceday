🔦 Spotlight: 100,000gns yearling; 13-2 when beaten a head into second of seven on her Kempton debut (1m, Polytrack) last month; that race was slowly run and dropping a furlong may not be ideal on breeding, but she is open to improvement,

🔦 Spotlight: Sent off 16-1 when making a successful debut in a maiden over C&D 19 days ago; scored by less than a length, but given she was drawn widest and missed the break her performance can be marked up; this 1000 Guineas entry is much respected under her 7lb penalty.

🔦 Spotlight: 175,000gns yearling; 17-2 for her Wolverhampton debut (6f, Tapeta) last month and showed greenness together with ability when finishing sixth of the 11 runners; extra furlong not an issue and improvement seems likely; player.
