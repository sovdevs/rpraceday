🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Some good form at Fontwell last year; he likes it here but is not ruled out after a break
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row at Fontwell last spring (2m3f, good/good to soft) and good second there (2m1f, good) in November; below-par fifth at Taunton (2m3f, good to soft) 11 days later and Fontwell brings out the best in him, but that latest run may have come too soon and he's not ruled out back from a break in a first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces).

🔦 Spotlight: Won maiden hurdle at Market Rasen (2m, good) in November and he's since been a respectable third in his first two handicaps (1m7f/2m, good to soft/soft); those were warm races and this front-runner can make a bold bid.
