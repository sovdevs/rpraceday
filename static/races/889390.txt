🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Jumping can be an issue but he ran well last time; can have big say granted a clear round
🔦 Spotlight: He's fallen on two of his five chase starts but won at Chepstow (2m3f, good to soft) in November and wasn't beaten far when last of three in a warm little handicap at Exeter (2m1f, good) three weeks ago; this is a drop in grade and he can have a big say if putting in a clear round.

🔦 Spotlight: Four-time hurdle winner (2m/2m5f) who made a pretty encouraging chasing debut in a Listed mares' novice at Exeter (2m1f, good to soft) last month; disappointing in handicap chase at Sandown (2m4f, good) since but she's better than that; no surprise if she bounces back with a bold show.

💬 Comment: Below par at Leicester recently but 📈 progressive over fences previously; cheekpieces go on
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wincanton (2m4f, good to soft) in December on second chase start and runner-up the next twice, including over C&D; also effective on good ground; below par at Leicester three weeks ago but he'll be a major player if swiftly returning to form in first-time cheekpieces.
