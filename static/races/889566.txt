🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in two Southwell novices and could bring potential to this handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Three starts last summer, notably third in 1m3f novice at Southwell (1m3f, Tapeta); put in his place by the winner when 5-4 favourite in another novice there (1m4f) five weeks ago after a six-month break, but beat the rest (Java Raja third) and could still bring potential to this handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wandered and carried head awkwardly when 3rd at Southwell (Sugar Road 2nd) five weeks ago
🔦 Spotlight: Poor on soft on debut last October but asserted in good style in a Wolverhampton maiden in December and backed up the form when third at Southwell (Sugar Road second) five weeks ago; tongue tied for those last two starts, over 1m4f on Tapeta; blinkers are added today after he wandered and carried his head awkwardly under pressure last time, which complicates the picture on this handicap debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed on the first and latest of his four starts back on the Flat this year (stayed hurdling in 2024); his last Flat win was in 2022 but he went down by a nose over C&D on latest outing, coming from last of seven, so returns to calculations despite going back up 3lb.
