💬 Comment: French AQPS winner in November who has been found a weak race for his British debut.
🔦 Spotlight: A £42,000 purchase in January after winning his third start in AQPS in France (1m4f), all on very soft/heavy; unproven on ground as quick as this and it's hard to gauge the level of his ability but he's of obvious appeal having been found a very weak race for his British/stable debut with Sean Bowen in the saddle.

💬 Comment: Only a modest level of form so far over hurdles but he's worth considering in a weak race.
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped promisingly on debut in a French Flat contest in February last year but has yet to build on that in five starts over hurdles since, latterly in Britain; faded late but didn't run badly back on the Flat at Southwell last month and he has to enter calculations in a weak race back in this code.
