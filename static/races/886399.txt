💬 Comment: Won at Thirsk on final run for Karl Burke; market informative on handicap/stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Found plenty of improvement when justifying support in a Thirsk novice (5f, good to firm) last August, on the third of her three 2yo runs; left Karl Burke for 7,000gns since but she's still 🔍 unexposed and needs watching in the market on handicap/stable debut.

💬 Comment: Exposed colt but he was an eyecatcher at Southwell latest; dangerous if he gets some luck
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Southwell novice and Musselburgh nursery during his nine-race 2yo campaign; no impact in two runs this year but he ran into some trouble after a slow start at Southwell 25 days ago; dropped 2lb and could be dangerous if things go more to plan this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the ninth attempt when landing a three-runner novice at Chelmsford (5f) last month; her confidence should be boosted after that success but she's fairly exposed now and has gone back up 2lb in the weights; has some work to do back in a handicap.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-11 but he went very close at Newcastle before a third at Southwell latest; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Still a maiden after 11 runs but he went very close at Newcastle (5f, Tapeta) last month before a creditable third at Southwell last time; ties in with some of today's rivals on that latest form and he's not ruled out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lingfield winner but he struggled on handicap debut at Southwell last month
🔦 Spotlight: Made a winning debut at Lingfield (5f, good; 14-1) last June; placed in two novice events after that but he returned after a break with a heavy defeat on handicap debut at Southwell (5f; first run since ✂️ gelded) last month; has something to prove after that and he's not really progressed so far.
