🔦 Spotlight: Cheltenham Grade 1 entry in novice hurdles; £85,000 buy after Irish point win; 📈 progressive placed form in his three maiden hurdles, giving the warm favourite plenty to think about at Cheltenham (extended 2m4f, soft) last time; the best hurdles form this term and good chance he will stay.

💬 Comment: Fourth of 12 in maiden hurdle at Warwick (2m5f; tongue tied) in December was more positive
🔦 Spotlight: Irish maiden point winner; didn't kick on from debut in bumpers but, after changing hands (same stable) for £120,000 and given wind surgery, his fourth of 12 in a maiden hurdle at Warwick (2m5f, good to soft; tongue tied) in December was more positive; player assuming he builds on that.

💬 Comment: The proven class act but he has some serious questions to answer at the moment
🔦 Spotlight: The proven class act but that's from his 2021-22 season over fences; looked set to be third before a last-flight fall in Grade 2 novice hurdle at Haydock (extended 3m, good to soft) in February 2023, which also reads well in this context, but pulled up at the Cheltenham Festival that March and ran poorly in December this term after a 643-day absence; questions to answer.

💬 Comment: This demands a lot more than his point win but he does have the Grade 1 Cheltenham entry
🔦 Spotlight: Sixth foal; half-brother to two 2m hurdle winners, one fairly useful; dam a fairly useful 2m-2m4f hurdle/chase winner, half-sister to dam of top 2m chaser Special Tiara; came good in his fourth British point, making all over 3m at Larkhill (good) last March; this rules debut demands a lot more but he does have the Grade 1 Cheltenham 3m novice hurdle entry.

💬 Comment: Back hurdling today from chasing and he stays when on song, but it's a mixed picture
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent placed form over hurdles in 2022-23 but reached that level only once last season over fences; had wind surgery before and after the latter campaign, left Harry Fry and fell at the first in another chase in December; back hurdling today and he stays when on song, but it's a mixed picture.

💬 Comment: Fourth of 12 in maiden hurdle at Warwick (2m5f; tongue tied) in December was more positive
🔦 Spotlight: Irish maiden point winner; didn't kick on from debut in bumpers but, after changing hands (same stable) for £120,000 and given wind surgery, his fourth of 12 in a maiden hurdle at Warwick (2m5f, good to soft; tongue tied) in December was more positive; player assuming he builds on that.

💬 Comment: The proven class act but he has some serious questions to answer at the moment
🔦 Spotlight: The proven class act but that's from his 2021-22 season over fences; looked set to be third before a last-flight fall in Grade 2 novice hurdle at Haydock (extended 3m, good to soft) in February 2023, which also reads well in this context, but pulled up at the Cheltenham Festival that March and ran poorly in December this term after a 643-day absence; questions to answer.

🔦 Spotlight: Sixth foal; half-brother to two 2m hurdle winners, one fairly useful; dam a fairly useful 2m-2m4f hurdle/chase winner, half-sister to dam of top 2m chaser Special Tiara; came good in his fourth British point, making all over 3m at Larkhill (good) last March; this rules debut demands a lot more but he does have the Grade 1 Cheltenham 3m novice hurdle entry.

🔦 Spotlight: Consistent placed form over hurdles in 2022-23 but reached that level only once last season over fences; had wind surgery before and after the latter campaign, left Harry Fry and fell at the first in another chase in December; back hurdling today and he stays when on song, but it's a mixed picture.
