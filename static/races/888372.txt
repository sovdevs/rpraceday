🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unraced beyond the 3m1f over which he won easily at Hereford (good) two weeks ago; up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced beyond the 3m1f he faced at Hereford (good) two weeks ago but he came from last to easily justify 11-8 favouritism in that five-runner handicap; this trip is very much unknown territory but this 7yo is in his first season chasing and going back up 5lb may underestimate him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good or good to soft might be best for him these days and he's won two of last four starts
🔦 Spotlight: Remote third in this race on heavy ground last year and he's not shone in any of his four attempts at about 3m6f; however, good or good to soft might be best for him these days and he's won two of his last four starts, 13 days ago doing so in a five-runner race over the extended 3m4f at Taunton (good) which was a reminder of him in his heyday.

💬 Comment: Stayed 3m4f when 2nd at Market Rasen on two of last three starts, latest under Ben Smith
🔦 Spotlight: Won on good ground one year ago; sole attempt at about 3m6f was nearly two years ago (well beaten) but he showed he stays 3m4f when runner-up in the Lincolnshire National at Market Rasen (good to soft) on Boxing Day this term; another solid second over that C&D (under Ben Smith) 19 days ago despite some notable mistakes; big shout if he can serve up the same here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won C&D Devon National latest; raced on only soft or heavy going for the last two years
🔦 Spotlight: Won three in a row once the cheekpieces were added last February/March and he's been better than ever this season, scoring over C&D from Neo King in the Devon National on latest start; 2lb higher today but the big issue is that he's raced on only soft or heavy going for the last two years.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Heavy ground over C&D one month ago may have been a little too much (respectable fourth)
🔦 Spotlight: Most of his best form is on good/good to soft ground and although he also won on soft at Windsor (3m4f) in January, heavy ground over C&D one month ago may have been a little too much (respectable fourth behind two of these); if none the worse for those exertions, he is a major player.
