💬 Comment: Placed in two bumpers but last month's C&D hurdle debut was very disappointing
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two of his three bumpers (good to soft/soft) but jumped poorly and made very disappointing hurdle debut when last of five in modest C&D (good) maiden last month; difficult to enthuse over after that run.

🔦 Spotlight: Soft-ground bumper winner for Ben Pauling last season; shaped with much more promise than eventual 25l defeat might suggest on stable/hurdle debut at Carlisle in November and was running big race before last-flight fall at Huntingdon (also 2m4f, good to soft) last month; leading contender.
