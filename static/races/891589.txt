💬 Comment: In the mix on his best 2yo form and Lambourn trainer has an excellent record here
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten in sales race at the Curragh last September when last seen (✂️ gelded since); however, he showed ability on both runs last summer (7f, good to firm) and can be in the mix if tapping back into that promise; Lambourn trainer is 5-12 (42%) here in the last five seasons.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won on debut in March (7f, AW); bright prospect; one of two key players for the stable
🔦 Spotlight: 13-2 when winning narrowly in a small field at Newcastle (7f, AW) in March on debut; improvement needed to defy a penalty today but he's a bright prospect; one of two key players for yard; betting may be interesting.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "We thought a fair bit of Camino Del Ray last year but we never ran him - he's a big horse and took him a while to come to hand. Today was an educational day, they've kicked a long way out and my lad just stays all day. He showed plenty of greenness but it all came good towards the end and he'll improve plenty from that - Ryan Sexton, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
