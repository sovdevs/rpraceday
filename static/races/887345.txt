üí¨ Comment: In a nice rhythm round here when convincing over C&D latest; up 7lb but still improving
üî¶ Spotlight: Strong traveller who lost his unbeaten chase record to a smart one at Uttoxeter in December but he  got into a nice rhythm round here when settling the argument quite convincingly over C&D (soft) in January; raised 7lb and he's closely matched with the third Masaccio but still rates an üöÄ improver.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Powerful front-runner; two C&D wins last winter; slow start to season; potential reviver
üî¶ Spotlight: Powerful front-runner when on song, as when winning twice over C&D (soft and good to soft) last midwinter before finishing an honourable runner-up in Grade 1 novice at the Festival; had some problems since but said to be showing better signs at home of late and is weighted to have a say, off just 2lb higher than the latest win; a revival could be on the way.

üî¶ Spotlight: Has run with great credit at the last two Festivals, finishing third in the Gold Cup and the Ryanair over C&D (both on soft); however, he's shown hardly a flicker of his former self in Graded races and a cross-country handicap here this winter and the return to regulation fences on this track needs to fan the flames; cheekpieces refitted after one run without.
