🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shaped with promise behind some useful prospects at Yarmouth; key player on his return
🔦 Spotlight: 220,000gns yearling; held in fourth of seven on Yarmouth debut (1m, soft) in October, but that was in tough conditions and he ran well for a long way behind some useful prospects; sets fair standard on that form and he's open to progress back from a break; key player.
