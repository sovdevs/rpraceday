🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bolted up on rules debut on testing ground chased home subsequent Gr 1 winner latest
🔦 Spotlight: Bolted up on his rules debut at Naas on testing ground and wasn't beaten far in a novice hurdle at Leopardstown since behind subsequent Aintree Grade 1 winner, Honesty Policy with re-opposing Coral River half a length behind; strong form, more to come back up in trip and less exposed than most; plenty to like.
Horse quote: 2025-01-26 at Naas (18.5f): "Champagne Jury is a fine big horse and got through that ground well. He looks a big chaser in the making. Going for a maiden hurdle might not be the worst idea - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Steadily improving and made it two from five under rules with a novice hurdle success at Thurles when last seen; however, that form has taken a few knocks since and he may need to improve again giving weight away to most.

🔦 Spotlight: Point and bumper winner who got off the mark over timber with maiden hurdle success at Wexford earlier this month having hit the crossbar in his two previous maiden hurdle runs; couldn't have won an easier, seemingly relish the step up in distance and looks like a major player again despite the rise in class.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Naas novice hurdle but that form knocked since; last of 8 in Gr 2 latest
🔦 Spotlight: Followed up a maiden hurdle success with a novice hurdle win at Naas in February but that form has taken a few knocks and he didn't beat a rival in a Fairyhouse Grade 2 since; will appreciate the drop in class at least.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Naas (18.5f): "Scalpnagoon put up a good performance. I was worried about the ground but he showed a good attitude. He's a big strong horse and he will jump a fence in time. The final of this is probably the aim - Gordon Elliott, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden hurdle winner here in November; behind Champagne Jury and Coral River 2 starts ago
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner here over similar trip in November; several fair runs in defeat since including behind re-opposing Champagne Jury and Coral River at Leopardstown last month; didn't build on that at Naas since.
Horse quote: 2024-11-15 at Punchestown (20f): "Rockymountainbeau had a good run in a point-to-point and his work at home has been good. We knew he'd be competitive but didn't know whether he needed the run but he did it well. It will sharpen him up a lot as he was looking for a bit of company - Tiernan Power Roche, rider, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner at Cork in October and bounced back from lesser effort to win a handicap off 104 on penultimate start; respectable fifth at the Dublin Racing Festival but sizeable improvement required to land this.
Horse quote: 2025-01-21 at Down Royal (17f): "Thisistheway is a lovely mare. She had the form to go and do that. She probably wants 2m4f and that good strong gallop suited. She will improve again - Cian Quirke, rider"
