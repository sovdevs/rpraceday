🔦 Spotlight: Has won four AW Class 6 handicaps this year; also runner-up five times including last two starts, most recently in this class; still has to prove himself on turf, but needs taking seriously.
Horse quote: 2025-01-04 at Wolverhampton (AW) (5f): "You'd like to think Frankies Dream is open to a bit of improvement. They went hard up front but that suited him. He's still learning to race, he's very forward going, but today he's switched off and finished strong. I think he'd stay 6f but he'd have to switch off again and a fast-run 5f is ideal - Joey Haynes, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2025-02-25 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "They went nice and quick which suited Star Zia because it just gave me a chance to switch off.
