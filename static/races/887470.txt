🔦 Spotlight: 0-14, but has improved for the switch to this yard and application of a hood/visor; ran well in both starts over C&D during the winter and was beaten less than a length into second of nine at Wolverhampton (5f, Tapeta) last month; races off the same mark and may prove the answer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner back off his last winning mark, but looks regressive; blinkers on
🔦 Spotlight: Landed a 0-50 classified event over C&D for Michael Bell last August and a Wolverhampton handicap off this mark (6f, Tapeta) in October, but has regressed since including on stable debut here (7f) in January; first-time blinkers the headgear of choice this time; drawn widest.
