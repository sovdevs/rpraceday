🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 in handicaps and bids for a quick hat-trick under a 7lb penalty; firmly on the up
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 since handicapping, winning at Carlisle (2m3f, good to soft) nine days ago and making the most of being unpenalised at Chepstow (2m3f, soft) on Saturday; has to carry a 7lb penalty this time, but he's firmly on the up and should make a bold bid for the hat-trick.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: French chase winner; beaten on stable debut over hurdles last time after a mammoth absence
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark when making all in a conditions chase in France in May 2022 (2m2f, good to soft), but not seen again until beaten a long way into last of five on stable debut in a Plumpton hurdle (2m5f, soft; 20-1) 16 days ago; may have needed it but still has enough to prove.
