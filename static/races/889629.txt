🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back off her last winning mark, but well held behind a couple of these here last month
🔦 Spotlight: All five AW wins have come on Tapeta including one over C&D just over a year ago; back off her last winning mark, but well held behind three of these here last month; looks vulnerable to less-exposed rivals.
