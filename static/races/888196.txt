🔦 Spotlight: Started off for Robbie Llewellyn with three disappointing runs but fared much better and led until after final fence when fourth here (2m7f, good to soft) in first-time visor three weeks ago; remains well handicapped on older form and will presumably be ridden positively again over today's much shorter trip.
