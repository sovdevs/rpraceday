🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very modest maiden on the Flat and pulled up last March on sole hurdle start

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful 3-time Flat winner who was 3rd on hurdle debut; this looks a very good opportunity
🔦 Spotlight: Useful three-time Flat winner (1m1f-10.3f; effective on good-heavy) who faded into a 5l third of five on last month's hurdle debut at Catterick (1m7f, soft); has obvious scope for improvement in this code if settling better and today's race looks a very good opportunity.

🔦 Spotlight: Disappointing at Catterick (2m3f, good) last time but prior to that he ran well from the front when second at Doncaster (2m, good), and he might not be far away if returning to form now back down in trip.

🔦 Spotlight: Below his best on the Flat last year but still posted a fair fourth at Southwell (1m4f, AW) in August on his penultimate run for Mark Walford; it's possible he'll make a hurdler and he's not ruled out on stable debut.
