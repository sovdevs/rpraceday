🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form figures of 1311214 (mostly at Kempton) since handicapping; solid claims back here
🔦 Spotlight: Has form figures of 1311214 (over 6f/7f, mostly at Kempton) since handicapping and had a few of these rivals behind him at Newcastle most recently, albeit the result might have been different if Cajetan had not suffered bad luck; 📈 progressive in the main and holds solid claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Record of 3-5 on AW; encountered major traffic issues last time; remains of interest
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 3-5 on AW features a useful 5l success at Newcastle (6f) in December; encountered major traffic issues there last month (behind two of these rivals) and that form needs marking up; 1-1 at Kempton; still open to further progress in this sphere and remains of interest.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful; good chance off current mark provided he's aided by first-time tongue-tie
