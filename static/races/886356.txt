🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two Tapeta wins last autumn; gone quiet more recently but this is an ease in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice on Tapeta in the autumn (6f and 5f) but he's gone off the boil in recent starts; back down in grade today and his rider takes off a useful 7lb; others more persuasive all the same.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy C&D win two weeks ago but enjoyed a dream trip; 6lb rise asks a stiffer question
🔦 Spotlight: Turned in a career-best effort when winning a C&D handicap by daylight two weeks ago; that race set up well for her, able to stalk the freewheeling leader before running on strongly in the closing stages; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question but Rossa Ryan retains the ride and she's not discounted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 at the track and won't need much more for the change of headgear to play a key role
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice here (5f and 6f) in the autumn and only collared in the last stride in his hat-trick bid in December; only fourth at Lingfield when last seen eight weeks ago but the return to Chelmsford could help, as could a change of headgear.

💬 Comment: Came from off the pace to win at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under the penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Looked set for better things when winning at Southwell in November, his third start for new connections, but he followed that with a handful of lesser efforts; back in top form when coming through late to win a well-run handicap at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under a penalty though and perhaps not straightforward.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wide draws the last twice and earlier Wolverhampton 3rd was a solid effort; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Had a purple patch last winter and he's now back to his last winning mark; a repeat of December's Wolverhampton third would give him strong claims at this level and he's been drawn widest in two starts since; 🔥 big player over a C&D where he is 2-3.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wide draws the last twice and earlier Wolverhampton 3rd was a solid effort; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Had a purple patch last winter and he's now back to his last winning mark; a repeat of December's Wolverhampton third would give him strong claims at this level and he's been drawn widest in two starts since; 🔥 big player over a C&D where he is 2-3.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came from off the pace to win at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under the penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Looked set for better things when winning at Southwell in November, his third start for new connections, but he followed that with a handful of lesser efforts; back in top form when coming through late to win a well-run handicap at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under a penalty though and perhaps not straightforward.

💬 Comment: Easy C&D win two weeks ago but enjoyed a dream trip; 6lb rise asks a stiffer question
🔦 Spotlight: Turned in a career-best effort when winning a C&D handicap by daylight two weeks ago; that race set up well for her, able to stalk the freewheeling leader before running on strongly in the closing stages; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question but Rossa Ryan retains the ride and she's not discounted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 at the track and won't need much more for the change of headgear to play a key role
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice here (5f and 6f) in the autumn and only collared in the last stride in his hat-trick bid in December; only fourth at Lingfield when last seen eight weeks ago but the return to Chelmsford could help, as could a change of headgear.

💬 Comment: Came from off the pace to win at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under the penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Looked set for better things when winning at Southwell in November, his third start for new connections, but he followed that with a handful of lesser efforts; back in top form when coming through late to win a well-run handicap at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under a penalty though and perhaps not straightforward.

💬 Comment: Wide draws the last twice and earlier Wolverhampton 3rd was a solid effort; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Had a purple patch last winter and he's now back to his last winning mark; a repeat of December's Wolverhampton third would give him strong claims at this level and he's been drawn widest in two starts since; 🔥 big player over a C&D where he is 2-3.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 at the track and won't need much more for the change of headgear to play a key role
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice here (5f and 6f) in the autumn and only collared in the last stride in his hat-trick bid in December; only fourth at Lingfield when last seen eight weeks ago but the return to Chelmsford could help, as could a change of headgear.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wide draws the last twice and earlier Wolverhampton 3rd was a solid effort; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Had a purple patch last winter and he's now back to his last winning mark; a repeat of December's Wolverhampton third would give him strong claims at this level and he's been drawn widest in two starts since; 🔥 big player over a C&D where he is 2-3.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came from off the pace to win at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under the penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Looked set for better things when winning at Southwell in November, his third start for new connections, but he followed that with a handful of lesser efforts; back in top form when coming through late to win a well-run handicap at Lingfield 11 days ago; 3lb wrong under a penalty though and perhaps not straightforward.

🔦 Spotlight: Good strike-rate on AW, including two wins over C&D, and she's run two sound races back from a five-month break; should make another bold bid; stable also run Secret Mistral.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 on AW but she has been placed in her last four starts, most recently when a never-dangerous third behind Secret Mistral here two weeks ago; on a dangerous mark but the change of headgear needs to give her a lift.

💬 Comment: Easy C&D win two weeks ago but enjoyed a dream trip; 6lb rise asks a stiffer question
🔦 Spotlight: Turned in a career-best effort when winning a C&D handicap by daylight two weeks ago; that race set up well for her, able to stalk the freewheeling leader before running on strongly in the closing stages; a 6lb rise asks a stiffer question but Rossa Ryan retains the ride and she's not discounted.

🔦 Spotlight: Won twice on Tapeta in the autumn (6f and 5f) but he's gone off the boil in recent starts; back down in grade today and his rider takes off a useful 7lb; others more persuasive all the same.
