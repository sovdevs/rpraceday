🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice-raced filly; not obviously well treated on handicap debut but has bags of potential
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 9.4f maiden here on debut in January 2024 and was then off 14 months before third of eight over 1m3f at Southwell (not clear run and switched) 18 days ago; bred to be suited by this further step up in distance; not obviously well treated on handicap debut but she has bags of potential.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Proving consistent for this yard; chance hinges on her staying this much longer trip
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced for her age; proving consistent for this yard, again making the frame when fourth of seven over 9.4f here in January; chance hinges on her staying this much longer trip (some encouragement from pedigree).
