🔦 Spotlight: Benefited from becoming eligible for classifieds this year, winning three at 1m and 7f, and although the race didn't work out for him back in a handicap in February, he made up a lot of ground to win in great style here (1m handicap) 19 days ago; back up 4lb but has every chance with a clear run.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning return to handicap company (1m) in February; no problem with 7f; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Often leads; has run mostly in classifieds of late but he made a winning return to handicap company at Wolverhampton (about 1m) in February; failed to do himself justice next time but the return to 7f won't be a problem; a contender on best form.
