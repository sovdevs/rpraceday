🔦 Spotlight: Couldn't quite justify favouritism in a 1m2f Goodwood Listed race (soft) last autumn on his first run for George Boughey but still recorded a career best RPR; won on last year's reappearance and a bold show is likely on return from wind surgery.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Turf Listed winner who landed good AW handicap in December (both 1m2f); opposable at 1m
🔦 Spotlight: Listed scorer at Sandown (1m2f, good) in 2023 and recorded a smart RPR when landing his first success since in 1m2f Newcastle handicap in December; this trip is a little short of his optimum and,  back from 113 days off, others are preferred for win purposes.
