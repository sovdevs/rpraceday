🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His second here in January reads well and then did it comfortably enough at Southwell
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled clear of a subsequent winner when chasing home the well-touted Palladium here in January (soft) and then fairly readily accounted for respectable opposition at Southwell (good to soft); has the penalty but he's looking a nice prospect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful on the Flat and has run well in three of his four hurdles; strong form claims
🔦 Spotlight: Useful on Flat and his only blip in four hurdle starts came in a Grade 2 at Cheltenham won by the Triumph third East India Dock; responded well to headgear on the Flat and had the cheekpieces back when going close in a Sandown handicap 11 days ago (good to soft); major player, for all that he may lack the potential of Wolf Moon.
