🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Added to her two Flat wins when scoring at Fakenham; up 5lb but she's a 🔥 big player again
🔦 Spotlight: Dual 1m2f Flat winner who was runner-up in two of her first four starts over hurdles, before going one better in handicap at Fakenham (2m, good to soft) two weeks ago; needed some riding to come from the rear to justify favouritism in that six-runner race but she was firmly in charge from the home turn; up 5lb but she's open to more progress and is a key player.
