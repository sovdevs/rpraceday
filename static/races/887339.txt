üí¨ Comment: Made it 3-4 over fences with romp at Kempton last time; a 12lb hike may not stop him
üî¶ Spotlight: Won in January in his first two chases (3m/3m2f, soft/heavy) then lacked fluency over his fences when second at Wincanton (3m2f, good to soft); bar one small blip he jumped much better at Kempton (3m, good to soft) 17 days ago when romping home in the Ladbrokes Trophy; hit with 12lb rise but that may not stop this highly üìà progressive 7yo, who was very impressive last time.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Stayed on well for 2nd in the Plate (extended 2m4f) 12 months ago; now 2lb lower; chance
üî¶ Spotlight: Can make mistakes and faded when upped to 3m1f at Aintree last April, while this season's form has been mixed; however, he stayed on well when second in the Plate (extended 2m4f) at last season's Festival and his pedigree suggests today's distance is worth another go; 2lb lower than 12 months ago and could play a leading role if finding some fluency and seeing out the trip.

üî¶ Spotlight: 10l win here (extended 3m3f, soft) in November 2023 and going well when falling three out here (3m2f, soft) next time; hasn't kicked on from those performances but she ran creditably when second in Listed mares' chase at Exeter (3m, heavy) last month and it's possible the return to Cheltenham will be a major boost; has also run well here on good ground; could be a player.

üí¨ Comment: Disappointing last time but this novice looked good previously; from a top Irish stable
üî¶ Spotlight: Disappointing on handicap debut at Leopardstown (2m5f, yielding) last month and unproven on the forecast good to soft ground; however, he looked good previously, going very close in a Grade 2 novice at Punchestown (3m, soft) then third in Grade 1 novice at Limerick (2m3f, yielding to soft); in top hands and could have potential off this mark if bouncing back to form.

üí¨ Comment: Ascot specialist; has struggled here previously, but üìà progressive and dangerous to rule out
üî¶ Spotlight: Struggled last term on both previous Cheltenham runs (including in this), which is a worry; this winter's two wins came at favourite course Ascot (3m, good to soft/good) but he also ran well at Newbury in November and this üìà progressive 7yo is climbing the weights only slowly; dangerous to rule out.

üí¨ Comment: Fair fourth in 2m4f handicap chase here in December but two lesser runs have followed
üî¶ Spotlight: Two wins here over hurdles and fair fourth in good handicap chase here (extended 2m4f, good to soft) in December; however, two lesser runs have followed (including here) and others appeal more; a tongue-tie goes on.
