💬 Comment: Made it 3-3 in Grade 1 Henry VIII; 5lb penalty today but standout claims nevertheless
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily on his first two chase starts (2m3f/2m, good to soft/good) before landing the four-runner Grade 1 Henry VIII Novices' Chase at Sandown (1m7f, soft) in December, beating two highly talented Gordon Elliott raiders; carries a 5lb penalty today but holds standout claims nevertheless.

💬 Comment: Beaten when falling on chase debut but in red-hot race; classy hurdler; needs respect
🔦 Spotlight: The forecast soft ground may not be ideal and he was well beaten in third when falling at the final fence on his chase debut at Kempton in December; however, he was taking on Sir Gino and Ballyburn in that Grade 2 and he's entitled to respect today in view of his hurdle form, having won the Grade 2 Elite Hurdle for second successive season at Wincanton (1m7f, good) in November.

💬 Comment: Made it 3-3 in Grade 1 Henry VIII; 5lb penalty today but standout claims nevertheless
🔦 Spotlight: Won easily on his first two chase starts (2m3f/2m, good to soft/good) before landing the four-runner Grade 1 Henry VIII Novices' Chase at Sandown (1m7f, soft) in December, beating two highly talented Gordon Elliott raiders; carries a 5lb penalty today but holds standout claims nevertheless.

💬 Comment: Beaten when falling on chase debut but in red-hot race; classy hurdler; needs respect
🔦 Spotlight: The forecast soft ground may not be ideal and he was well beaten in third when falling at the final fence on his chase debut at Kempton in December; however, he was taking on Sir Gino and Ballyburn in that Grade 2 and he's entitled to respect today in view of his hurdle form, having won the Grade 2 Elite Hurdle for second successive season at Wincanton (1m7f, good) in November.
