💬 Comment: Won AW nursery on final start for Sir Michael Stoute and likely more to come for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Ended his time with Sir Michael Stoute with an improved performance to win a 1m Southwell AW nursery in a first-time visor (retained) in November; subsequently ✂️ gelded; likely he has more to offer for a new stable (same owner) in excellent form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Arrives on a hat-trick after two AW wins; 6lb rise demands more improvement, but respected
🔦 Spotlight: 0-5 for Richard Hannon but has quickly hit the target on AW for new stable, following a Southwell maiden win in January with a handicap success at Kempton last month (both 1m); a 6lb rise demands further progress back on turf but he has to be respected in his current mood.
Horse quote: 2025-01-24 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "It was a nice spot for Invited today, and the race couldn't have gone any smoother for him - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Promise when second at Chester (7.5f, good to soft) and Thirsk (1m, good) on first two outings and had heavy ground as a possible excuse for below-par third at Nottingham on final start; no surprise were he to resume his progress on handicap/seasonal debut for a stable which does well in this race.

🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive in his first three runs, culminating in a Hamilton maiden win (1m, soft); something can't have been right when tailed-off last of five in Pontefract Listed race (1m, soft again) on final start; no shock were he to resume his progress for last year's winning owner and trainer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ex-French; won C&D maiden for 🆕 new yard 17 days ago; more needed from opening mark of 84
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in each of his three runs for Jean-Claude Rouget in France last year; new connections acquired him for 69,000euros at the end of 2024 and he made a winning start for them in a C&D maiden (good) 17 days ago, wandering around a little under pressure but nicely on top towards the finish; will need to step up on that form to defy an opening mark of 84 but further progress wouldn't surprise.
Horse quote: 2025-04-02 at Musselburgh (8f): "Zowal had shown good form in France last year, he's pleased us since we've had him and that was a really nice start. He was just rolling around a little bit. Hopefully he'll improve going forward and still learn. When we first got him we thought he might be a mile-and-a-quarter horse and wouldn't have been stunned if he was a mile-and-a-half horse, but he's not shy of speed. He'd been working at home with Empirestateofmind, who ran in the Spring Mile, so that convinced us to start at a mile and take it from there - Sean Quinn, joint-trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Novice win last year; creditable third on recent AW reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark in a Thirsk novice (7f, good) last August; tailed off in 7f Doncaster nursery on final 2yo start but got his career back on track when third in 1m Southwell handicap on reappearance 13 days ago; his stable, which is no stranger to success in this contest, also runs Hot Dancer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two nursery wins last year but more exposed than some in this field; has been ✂️ gelded
🔦 Spotlight: Won a pair of nurseries in the mud (6f/7f) last September but the handicapper looked in charge by the end of the autumn; ✂️ gelded ahead of reappearance; proven at 1m but possibly vulnerable to less exposed types.
Horse quote: 2024-09-04 at Hamilton (6f): "Our Mighty Mo ran a really solid race last time out at York and we thought we'd come here with a real live chance. He's strengthened up all year and he stuck at it really well - James Cowley, trainer's assistant, speaking on Racing TV."
