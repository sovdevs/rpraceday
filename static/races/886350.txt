🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**

🔦 Spotlight: Unlucky to bump into one each of her four starts on Tapeta at up to 1m; suspect the two runners who finished third on debut won't have to step up much to beat her but she commands respect.

💬 Comment: Pleasing debut third and this half-sister to seven winners shouldn't be long in scoring
🔦 Spotlight: The form of her debut third at Kempton in December (1m; sent off 10-1) is yet to be really tested but it was a pleasing start; this half-sister to seven winners shouldn't be long in scoring.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Evidently beatable but commands respect
🔦 Spotlight: Unlucky to bump into one each of her four starts on Tapeta at up to 1m; suspect the two runners who finished third on debut won't have to step up much to beat her but she commands respect.
