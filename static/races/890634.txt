🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had the pace for 5f when an encouraging 4th on reappearance; this looks easier
🔦 Spotlight: All 2yo races at about 6f, failing to go on from a promising debut at Newmarket; an inability to settle was more of a problem than a lack of speed when dropped to 5f at Wolverhampton 15 days ago but she kept on well in the straight and this is likely to take less winning.
