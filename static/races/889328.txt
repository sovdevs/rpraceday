🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner over hurdles who made it 2-4 over fences with a 15l success in first-time blinkers at Market Rasen (3m, good) eight days ago; Beau Morgan's claim partly offsets the 7lb penalty and she is a major player once again.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-10 over regulation fences but she has often run well, as when chasing home a subsequent winner in a four-runner contest at Fakenham (2m5f, good) last month; still has to prove her stamina for this far under rules, but still a player in another small field.
