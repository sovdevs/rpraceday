💬 Comment: No match for the winner at Newbury but that was another personal best
🔦 Spotlight: It's all been good since sent handicapping in cheekpieces and better than ever when second at Newbury (2m4f, soft; won on good), for all that he couldn't get the winner off the bridle; solid chance despite a further 3lb nudge.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Upwardly mobile gelding who won with a bit in hand at Market Rasen; that form is solid
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent gelding who won by a comfortable 3l at Market Rasen (2m7f, good to soft; won on good) last time and the runner-up has since filled the same berth at Newbury; this 7yo was ideally positioned that day in what developed into a sprint finish but a 5lb rise could have been worse; Murray Dodd rides again claiming his 7lb.

🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner and two hurdle victories include a 2m handicap on good ground; latest Kempton run (2m5f, good to soft) hinted at some stamina limitations over this far but that was a competitive race and today's forecast drier ground should be favourable; every chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well treated and was running a good race when slipping up before two out at Kelso
🔦 Spotlight: Well handicapped on his Cheltenham seconds (2m4f/3m) in late 2022; lightly raced in the meantime and he was still travelling with some purpose when slipping up before two out in a Class 2 handicap at Kelso a month ago (2m5f; in this first-time headgear combination); respected.
