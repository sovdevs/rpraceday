🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well-bred gelding and he could show a lot more now upped in trip on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a half-sister to winners Scoubidou (Italian 1m 2yo Group 3) and Sommelier (German 1m6f Listed); no show at huge odds in three runs (6f/7f) in October but he's been ✂️ gelded since and could look a different proposition now upped in trip on handicap debut; interesting contender for notable yard.

🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent ten-race maiden but she's dropped down the weights and was a close third of six in a Newcastle handicap (1m, Tapeta; first-time cheekpieces) last month; kept on well in that race and she's respected back up in trip.

💬 Comment: Well held in first three runs but she's open to progress now switched to a minor handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Big prices and was beaten around 12l in three runs (1m/8.6f) during the winter but this is more realistic and she's open to progress now handicapping off a lowly mark; one to keep an eye on back from 114 days off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive in his qualifying runs and he needs a close look on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Improved with each of his three qualifying runs, most recently when a 5l third of seven at Southwell (1m, Tapeta) in January; looks on fair mark now switched to a handicap and he should have more to offer on this step up in trip; in the mix.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed filly and she's a possible 🚀 improver upped in trip on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Finished down the field in three novice/maiden events (7f, AW) but this is more realistic on handicap debut and she's a possible 🚀 improver upped in trip; needs watching in market.
