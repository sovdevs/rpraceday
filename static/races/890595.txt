🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back to form with his Newbury second and looks a safer bet than many in here
🔦 Spotlight: Won three handicaps at about this distance as a novice and returned to form when second at Newbury four weeks ago; the winner ran well to be third at Cheltenham this week; versatile ground-wise and looks a safer bet than many in here.
Horse quote: 2024-04-01 at Plumpton (20f): "Scarface took two or three runs to really get the hang of jumping, but the last two runs he's travelled and jumped well. Today was smooth all the way, he looked the winner some way out. I always thought he'd improve for fences. He'll have to go up in grade after that. He's still a novice this year, so we'll probably take him to Sandown at the end of the season and then step him up in trip next year - Joe Trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Until last time he had made an excellent start to chasing career; could bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Ascot (2m2f) on his chase debut and then an excellent second of nine in 2m3f handicap at Doncaster; has to bounce back from a poor run last time but that was two months ago; hard to dismiss.
Horse quote: 2024-11-22 at Ascot (19f): "We were a bit concerned about the ground, but it was Bucksy Des Epeires' first run over fences and he was a little bit novicey early on. He warmed to it and I always hoped he'd be a better chaser, so it was nice to do it - especially at Ascot - Venetia Williams, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good last run given the circumstances and a likely contender with Harry Cobden booked
🔦 Spotlight: Free-goer who was game in victory at Chepstow (2m, heavy) two runs back and he got competitive a long way out there over 2m3f last time, so that was a good run in the circumstances; likely contender with Harry Cobden booked.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well handicapped and could yet turn around what's been a modest season
🔦 Spotlight: Only 13 months ago he won off a 2lb lower mark at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) and he could yet turn around what's been a modest season; market confidence would be welcomed, however.
Horse quote: 2024-03-23 at Newbury (20f): "Heltenham won over hurdles at the start of the season and maybe had a hard race, but he definitely had a hard race at Aintree after that on bad ground. Before Kempton in February, his coat massively changed and I knew he hadn't been right. He's come into form and is pretty effective round here and we'll look at all sorts of races. Maybe Sandown and the Oaksey Chase will suit him at the end of the season, a big galloping track. If a Bravemansgame turns up in that, he isn't in his league, but there's a race at Perth for him and options at Ayr and he's in the Topham too - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Won back-to-back Wetherby handicaps over slightly shorter last season but hasn't hit the same notes this campaign; however, he's back from a break and too well handicapped to ignore.
Horse quote: 2024-02-03 at Wetherby (19.5f): "We can't get too carried away as the race fell apart behind him but I'm delighted for Mrs Watson, who is one of our longest standing supporters.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has the form to have a major say but last three runs have been underwhelming
🔦 Spotlight: Beat none other than Kandoo Kid at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in November 2023 and his two runs after an absence were encouraging; lesser ones have followed, though the latest was in the Kim Muir over a trip of 3m2f he would struggle to stay.
