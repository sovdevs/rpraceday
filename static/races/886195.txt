🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good record at Ascot includes a success in this contest 12 months ago; rock-solid claims
🔦 Spotlight: Smart chaser and regular front-runner whose last five attempts at Ascot have resulted in form figures of 12111; sole start this season resulted in a second success in the 1965 Chase over C&D (good); beat all bar impressive Shishkin in this contest in 2023, then went one better last year (good to soft); again holds rock-solid claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best on left-handed tracks but is respected on ability; second in this race last year
🔦 Spotlight: Finished third in the King George on reappearance then justified favouritism in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham (3m1f, soft), taking record over fences to 8-13; tends to jump left on clockwise tracks, including when second in this race 12 months ago, and it's three years since his last success right-handed; otherwise, he's a 🔥 big player on ratings.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🎖️ major contender provided he copes with the drop back to 2m5f and shows best form
🔦 Spotlight: Second-season chaser who never landed a blow in good-ground King George last time (raced mostly on soft/heavy otherwise); not short of stamina, having been successful over 3m6f at the 2024 Cheltenham Festival, but his last attempt over 2m5f resulted in a win; major player provided he copes with the return to this distance and shows best form.

🔦 Spotlight: Record of 4-7 over fences includes a Grade 1 novice win last term and impressive handicap performance at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) on reappearance; perhaps unsuited by the return to Cheltenham last time; has something to find at the weights but looks interesting as a second-season chaser who could rate higher still.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful but faces a very stiff task back ⬆️ up in class
