🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of the frame in Ireland; favourite on recent yard debut when 5th; this trip can suit
🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in 11 Irish starts but showed ability and was made favourite on debut for rising force James Owen here (about 1m) recently; lacked the pace to threaten that day and finished behind slow-starting Brinton, but this trip can suit better; fitting a visor could also help.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D form is inconclusive but worth another go at the trip after two good runs at about 1m
🔦 Spotlight: Slow starter; has mostly raced over shorter but a C&D defeat in September was inconclusive (given a break after; form had substance) and she's worth another go over this far after two strong efforts at around 1m here since.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of the frame in Ireland; favourite on recent yard debut when 5th; this trip can suit
🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in 11 Irish starts but showed ability and was made favourite on debut for rising force James Owen here (about 1m) recently; lacked the pace to threaten that day and finished behind slow-starting Brinton, but this trip can suit better; fitting a visor could also help.
