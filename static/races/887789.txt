🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Ralph Beckett; maiden winner on debut at three, 0-10 in stakes races; went close in Group 3 over 1m4f at Newbury last April and short-headed in 1m6f Listed race at York in June; however, his other runs last season were disappointing; holds Supreme Novices' entry; handles soft ground.

💬 Comment: Seems to have had training issues, hard to be confident after Naas failure five weeks ago
🔦 Spotlight: Impressed when winning a bumper at Naas on debut in February 2022; ran only once last season after a long absence; made a pleasing return when leading for a long way on his hurdling debut at Cork, ending up third behind the market principals; hard to be confident after a poor showing in the Naas maiden in which Honesty Policy was second.

🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Ralph Beckett; maiden winner on debut at three, 0-10 in stakes races; went close in Group 3 over 1m4f at Newbury last April and short-headed in 1m6f Listed race at York in June; however, his other runs last season were disappointing; holds Supreme Novices' entry; handles soft ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Impressed when winning a bumper at Naas on debut in February 2022; ran only once last season after a long absence; made a pleasing return when leading for a long way on his hurdling debut at Cork, ending up third behind the market principals; hard to be confident after a poor showing in the Naas maiden in which Honesty Policy was second.
