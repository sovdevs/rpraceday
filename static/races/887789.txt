🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stable selected, good chance of going one better than on hurdling debut at Naas
🔦 Spotlight: Split a pair trained by champion trainer Colin Bowe when second in a maiden at Castletown Geoghegan in October; did well to make a race of it with odds-on shot Joystick on hurdling debut at Naas; stable selected; can step up a place.

🔦 Spotlight: Impressed when winning a bumper at Naas on debut in February 2022; ran only once last season after a long absence; made a pleasing return when leading for a long way on his hurdling debut at Cork, ending up third behind the market principals; hard to be confident after a poor showing in the Naas maiden in which Honesty Policy was second.
