🔦 Spotlight: Impressed when winning a bumper at Naas on debut in February 2022; ran only once last season after a long absence; made a pleasing return when leading for a long way on his hurdling debut at Cork, ending up third behind the market principals; hard to be confident after a poor showing in the Naas maiden in which Honesty Policy was second.
