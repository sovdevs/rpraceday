üí¨ Comment: Three-time Flat winner, no impact in both handicap hurdles, others make more appeal
üî¶ Spotlight: Three-time winner on the Flat at 1m4f-2m on the AW and on soft ground; 0-5 over hurdles and struggled in first two handicaps, the latest in March 2023; fit from the Flat but hard to fancy on hurdling form.
