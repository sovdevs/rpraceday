🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Newmarket debut wasn't devoid of promise and this 105,000gns yearling can improve
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 5l when sixth of seven on debut in fillies' maiden at Newmarket (5f, good to soft; 100-30) but that looked a good race and she showed pace; this 105,000gns yearling is in good hands to progress and could have a big say.

💬 Comment: Best of the newcomers when third on recent debut at Yarmouth, when sent off favourite
🔦 Spotlight: 100,000gns yearling whose unraced dam is from a classy family; sent off favourite when 1l third of six on recent debut at Yarmouth (5f, good), behind two experienced rivals, and he's a strong contender today.

💬 Comment: Tackled hot race over C&D on debut but was a well-beaten fourth of seven at 33-1
🔦 Spotlight: 33-1 and no match for the first three when fourth of seven over C&D (good) on last month's debut; it looked a hot race and improvement is possible, but he has the worst claims of the three on form.
