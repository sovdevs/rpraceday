🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returns from absence with new stable in fantastic form and could improve now chasing
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well in defeat for Warren Greatrex last spring in his first two handicap hurdles (2m4f/3m, heavy/good); absent since (wind op in interim) but returns with new stable in fantastic form (remains in same ownership) and this point runner-up could improve now chasing.

💬 Comment: Narrowly in front when unseating five out here ten days ago; could be a contender
🔦 Spotlight: 0-10 but ran well when third at Warwick (3m, good to soft) in December and heavy ground may not have suited at Chepstow next time; narrowly in front in a first-time visor (retained) when unseating five out here (3m2f, good to soft) ten days ago and he could be a contender granted a clear round.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went very close over C&D last month despite a stumble after jumping two out; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Returned to form when second at Ludlow (2m4f, good to soft) in December and beaten a short head over this C&D (good to soft) last month; did well to get so close last time having stumbled after jumping two out, and he's 🔍 unexposed at this sort of trip; key player off the same mark.
