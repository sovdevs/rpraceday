🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd in all her three handicap hurdles, two under Benjamin Macey; firmly in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Second on good to soft in November at Chepstow (3m) and Carlisle (3m1f) in her first two handicaps; fell early on chase debut but reverted to hurdles with another second at Warwick (3m2f, soft) four weeks ago; two of those seconds were under Benjamin Macey; edging up weights but firmly in the mix.

🔦 Spotlight: Emerged in a well-beaten third of 12 when 50-1 for debut at Leicester (2m4f) in November, which is his best form after he pulled up at Uttoxeter (3m) and went down by 23l at Hereford (3m2f); those three maidens were on good to soft; needs marked improvement on this handicap debut in first headgear.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 487 days off before showing some ability remains here (extended 2m3f; 80-1) latest start
🔦 Spotlight: Showed some ability in novice hurdles in 2023 but his three handicap performances need improving on; absent 487 days before showing that some ability remains here (extended 2m3f; 80-1) on latest start; could come on from that run but not proven over this far.
