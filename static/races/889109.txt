💬 Comment: Stayed on well behind Monbeg Park over 2m5f at Leopardstown last Sunday, trip should suit
🔦 Spotlight: Won three in a row early in 2023; has finished second in three of his five starts since returning from a lengthy spell on the sidelines; backed up a promising Windsor run when staying on well behind Monbeg Park over 2m5f at Leopardstown last Sunday; would have been closer but for interference; extra distance should suit.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a valuable novice handicap at Navan in March 2023 off 107; ran only three times last season; fine effort when touched off in a Listed handicap chase at Punchestown off 124; should be close to a peak again now following last month's Gowran run.
