🔦 Spotlight: One of three for yard; gained second 1m course win on latest off 50 for this jockey and has been hiked up 6lb; his 7f form isn't as good so the drop back in trip has to be viewed as a negative; others appeal more at this trip.
Horse quote: 2024-03-26 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Bungle Inthedesert was there to be shot at and had plenty to do in the last furlong, but in fairness to him he did it. Thankfully, we stayed in front and he was good and game - Siobhan Rutledge, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Two-time course winner at 6f, including a first handicap win on latest when making all to score by 0.5l at 50-1; up 4lb for that and steps up to 7f, a trip that probably stretches his stamina; others make more appeal.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two time course winner at 6f, made all off 4lb lower latest, 7f a query, others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: Two-time course winner at 6f, including a first handicap win on latest when making all to score by 0.5l at 50-1; up 4lb for that and steps up to 7f, a trip that probably stretches his stamina; others make more appeal.

🔦 Spotlight: Veteran has won six times on the AW, including three over this C&D; last won in December 2023 off 48 and he runs off that mark here; however, he has been off the track since July 2024 and he's entitled to need this run.
Horse quote: 2020-12-02 at Dundalk (AW) (6f): "Tynamite did it well in the end. The step back in trip suited him and he just needs a bit of tricking for to go. Coming between horses helps him - Oisin Orr, rider"
