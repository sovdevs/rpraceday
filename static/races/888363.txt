🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Belied 16-1 odds to win on debut at Ayr and that form has been franked; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Belied market weakness to win at 16-1 under Conner McCann on debut at Ayr (2m, soft) in January; had 3l to spare from a subsequent winner and is a highly likeable prospect; one of three for Lucinda Russell; McCann can't claim his usual 7lb; respected nevertheless.

🔦 Spotlight: Justified 13-8 favouritism under Patrick Wadge on debut over C&D (good to soft) in November; off since and improvement is needed to defy a penalty today, but his inexperience was evident last time and he could have plenty more to offer for his respected trainer, who runs three in this.

💬 Comment: Won at Carlisle on second run; others have more substance to their form but he's 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Built upon debut fifth at Carlisle (2m1f, soft) to win there (2m1f, soft) last month; others have more substance to their form but this half-brother to high-class chaser Ballyoisin could continue to improve.
