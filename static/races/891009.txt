🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still progressing over fences and may have won without a late error at Gowran last month
🔦 Spotlight: Came on from his return with a 66-1 third at Fairyhouse in January and posted a career best when beaten just half a length at Gowran last month; may have won that without a mistake at the last and a 3lb rise is fair.
