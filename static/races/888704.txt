🔦 Spotlight: Two wins over hurdles, including a Grade 2 novice over 2m7f at Limerick, rated 140; satisfactory third on chase debut at this venue, 10l behind stablemate High Class Hero; unlikely to reverse that form in view of his failure to make the frame at Navan.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful hurdler has failed to build on a satisfactory chase debut, tame display on latest
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; 2-6 over hurdles, rated 137; not a bad effort on chasing debut at Galway in October; struggled at Fairyhouse and 66-1 when giving tame display at Leopardstown; however, worth noting that his stablemate Backtonormal, who finished sixth at 40-1 in the Leopardstown race, has since won a valuable handicap as a well-backed favourite.
