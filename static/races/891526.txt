💬 Comment: Dual winner over 1m last year and third on his Redcar return; major player from same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner over 1m on good/AW last year and finished third of 13 on his Redcar return (7f, good) this month; didn't find as much off the bridle as had seemed likely, but possible the run was just needed after five months off; major player from the same mark.

💬 Comment: 1-19, but beaten less than a length into third on return from six months off at Pontefract
🔦 Spotlight: 1-19, but having attempted to make all he was beaten less than a length into third of nine on his return from six months off at Pontefract (1m, good) 13 days ago (a short head behind Paris Lights); claims if building on that from the same mark.
Horse quote: 2023-06-18 at Doncaster (8f): "That went very smoothly. Last time Power Of Gold's race was run before the stalls opened as he got himself a bit worked up, hence the red hood today which made a big difference to conserving his energy - Ross Coakley, jockey."

💬 Comment: Beaten under a length into second at Pontefract last time; shortlisted if repeating that
🔦 Spotlight: 0-13 on turf and 2-27 overall, but he was beaten less than a length into second of nine on his return to grass at Pontefract (1m, good) 13 days ago (just ahead of Power Of Gold); races off the same mark and one for the shortlist if repeating that effort.
Horse quote: 2024-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "We didn't go very quick. Paris Lights has been threatening to run well and has been disappointing but Paul [Midgley, trainer] has got him in a good place now and hopefully he can build on this - David Nolan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Should be suited by the conditions; ran well for a long way on recent Musselburgh return
🔦 Spotlight: Should be suited by the conditions with both wins last year coming on good to firm (6f/1m); ran well for a long way when fifth of 13 on his Musselburgh return (1m, good) a fortnight ago and could go well with the run under his belt.
Horse quote: 2024-06-22 at Redcar (6f): "It was a good shout from Grant as I didn't think this would be Jesmond Dawn's trip. We thought a fair bit of him as a two-year-old and he disappointed a bit, so it's good to get his head in front - Sam James, rider, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has failed to make the frame in all six handicaps; ground unlikely to be in his favour
🔦 Spotlight: Made a successful reappearance in a Haydock maiden (1m, soft) a year ago, but he failed to make the frame in all six handicaps subsequently; ✂️ gelded since last seen and plenty to prove with the ground unlikely to be in his favour.
