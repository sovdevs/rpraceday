🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent 2m4f win here franked since; 8lb rise may not prevent a follow up
🔦 Spotlight: Showed some ability in a bumper on debut but little impact hurdling until much improved under forcing tactics to win here over 2m4f last month (Mount Shenshan well beaten), surviving some sketchy jumping; second and third have run well since so form looks strong and 8lb rise may not prevent a follow up.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Punchestown maiden run augurs well for handicap return off unchanged mark
🔦 Spotlight: Best effort yet in maidens came at Punchestown last month when close to much of pace in finishing fourth to a hotpot over 2m4f (heavy); unchanged mark back in handicap and one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best form on better ground; cheekpieces now tried and may yet improve
🔦 Spotlight: Good second on hurdles debut in a 2m2f Ballinrobe maiden last summer but hasn't run to anything like that form since, just fair efforts when beaten around 11l in recent handicaps at Fairyhouse and Punchestown; cheekpieces now tried and may yet improve.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent 2m4f win here franked since; 8lb rise may not prevent a follow up
🔦 Spotlight: Showed some ability in a bumper on debut but little impact hurdling until much improved under forcing tactics to win here over 2m4f last month (Mount Shenshan well beaten), surviving some sketchy jumping; second and third have run well since so form looks strong and 8lb rise may not prevent a follow up.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Best form on better ground; cheekpieces now tried and may yet improve
🔦 Spotlight: Good second on hurdles debut in a 2m2f Ballinrobe maiden last summer but hasn't run to anything like that form since, just fair efforts when beaten around 11l in recent handicaps at Fairyhouse and Punchestown; cheekpieces now tried and may yet improve.

🔦 Spotlight: Showed some ability in a bumper on debut but little impact hurdling until much improved under forcing tactics to win here over 2m4f last month (Mount Shenshan well beaten), surviving some sketchy jumping; second and third have run well since so form looks strong and 8lb rise may not prevent a follow up.
