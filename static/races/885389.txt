💬 Comment: French winner who flopped on British debut, but wind op since and retains potential
🔦 Spotlight: Won in France (2m2f, heavy) last March on his second start; flopped at 1-3 at Wetherby (2m3f, good) in November on stable debut but reportedly made a respiratory noise and has since had wind surgery; retains potential for top yard and could bounce back with a big run on handicap debut.

💬 Comment: Harry Skelton rides stablemate but the drop back in trip looks a plus following a break
🔦 Spotlight: His best form has come on good ground and Harry Skelton rides stablemate Kart d'Estruval; however, hinted at promise on soft going and was progressive last August-October after joining this yard; didn't see out 2m4f at Aintree when last seen and he's of interest on his first run since a wind op.

💬 Comment: Lightly raced 7yo; didn't run badly on return & may have benefited from subsequent wind op
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner who scored at Wetherby (2m, soft) last January on his second hurdle start; hasn't kicked on from there but he didn't run badly on his reappearance at Uttoxeter (2m, soft) in December and this lightly raced 7yo may have benefited from the subsequent wind op; possible contender.
