💬 Comment: Well worth a 📊 market check on stable debut after 140 days off; drying ground may help
🔦 Spotlight: Showed ability for Tim Dennis last year, as when second of 14 at Taunton (3m, good) in April; beaten a very long way in only completed start for previous yard but, having changed hands again (for 7,000gns) in December, is well worth a 📊 market check starting out for Olly Murphy after 140 days off; drying ground may help.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Distant second behind a dual subsequent winner last month; bit more needed; cheekpieces on
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten a long way in his first four starts over hurdles and although second of ten behind a dual subsequent winner at Wincanton (2m6f, good to soft) last month, still finished 26l behind that rival; probably needs the cheepieces to bring about a bit more improvement.
