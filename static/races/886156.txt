🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: An improving chaser but wouldn't want the ground to any worse than good to soft
🔦 Spotlight: Improving when he won back-to-back handicaps at Southwell (3m, good) and Musselburgh (2m4f, good to soft) and perhaps failed to handle the soft ground when a remote second (last to complete) back at Southwell last time; today's conditions might be borderline but his ability is respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went up 10lb for his 10l Southwell win and it could be that he's now on a tough mark
🔦 Spotlight: Only his second run over fences and the first in this headgear combination when winning by 10l at Southwell (extended 2m4f; good to soft) and it was a competitive handicap in which he struggled at Newbury (2m6f) after a 10lb rise; could be on a tough mark but warrants respect nonetheless.

💬 Comment: Absent a good while but potentially well handicapped if he's as good as he was
🔦 Spotlight: Absent since a remote finish on his chase debut at Cheltenham in October 2023; he was a dual novice hurdle winner the season before (2m5f/3m) and also placed in a Doncaster Grade 2 (3m, good); potentially well handicapped if as good as he was; the betting could be enlightening.

🔦 Spotlight: Improving when he won back-to-back handicaps at Southwell (3m, good) and Musselburgh (2m4f, good to soft) and perhaps failed to handle the soft ground when a remote second (last to complete) back at Southwell last time; today's conditions might be borderline but his ability is respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went up 10lb for his 10l Southwell win and it could be that he's now on a tough mark
🔦 Spotlight: Only his second run over fences and the first in this headgear combination when winning by 10l at Southwell (extended 2m4f; good to soft) and it was a competitive handicap in which he struggled at Newbury (2m6f) after a 10lb rise; could be on a tough mark but warrants respect nonetheless.

🔦 Spotlight: Absent since a remote finish on his chase debut at Cheltenham in October 2023; he was a dual novice hurdle winner the season before (2m5f/3m) and also placed in a Doncaster Grade 2 (3m, good); potentially well handicapped if as good as he was; the betting could be enlightening.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Absent a good while but potentially well handicapped if he's as good as he was
🔦 Spotlight: Absent since a remote finish on his chase debut at Cheltenham in October 2023; he was a dual novice hurdle winner the season before (2m5f/3m) and also placed in a Doncaster Grade 2 (3m, good); potentially well handicapped if as good as he was; the betting could be enlightening.
