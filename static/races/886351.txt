🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed in blinkers 15 days ago, scooting clear of the reopposing Blue Seeker; up 7lb
🔦 Spotlight: Did a fair bit wrong but still ran out an emphatic winner of a 7f Wolverhampton handicap two weeks ago, picking up strongly in the straight (blinkered for the first time); up 7lb but could well have more in the tank.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten at odds-on when 3rd to McKenna at Wolverhampton latest; not fully exposed just yet
🔦 Spotlight: Impressive when rewarding strong market support on his nursery debut (7f) at Wolverhampton on Boxing Day; hit with an 8lb rise for that and he failed to pick up having raced freely back at Wolverhampton two weeks ago, unable to match McKenna's change of gear; too soon to write him off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Overcame inexperience (hung sharply left late on) when winning at Chelmsford latest
🔦 Spotlight: Promising third at Kempton on debut (7f) and he still looked a work in progress when getting up late to win a Chelmsford maiden eight days later, hanging sharply left in the closing stages; retains potential but that form isn't working out.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only midfield when favourite on handicap debut last month; this looks warm for the grade
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in maiden/novice company and he was sent off favourite for his handicap debut at Kempton four weeks ago, only to finish in midfield; still has time on his side but he's in a warm event here so interesting to see if his backers return.

🔦 Spotlight: Did a fair bit wrong but still ran out an emphatic winner of a 7f Wolverhampton handicap two weeks ago, picking up strongly in the straight (blinkered for the first time); up 7lb but could well have more in the tank.

🔦 Spotlight: Impressive when rewarding strong market support on his nursery debut (7f) at Wolverhampton on Boxing Day; hit with an 8lb rise for that and he failed to pick up having raced freely back at Wolverhampton two weeks ago, unable to match McKenna's change of gear; too soon to write him off.

🔦 Spotlight: Recorded a slower time than McKenna when winning the first division of a 7f handicap at Wolverhampton 15 days ago; kept on well there and she's capable of better but will need another step forward to follow up.

🔦 Spotlight: Impressive when rewarding strong market support on his nursery debut (7f) at Wolverhampton on Boxing Day; hit with an 8lb rise for that and he failed to pick up having raced freely back at Wolverhampton two weeks ago, unable to match McKenna's change of gear; too soon to write him off.

🔦 Spotlight: Promise in maiden/novice company and he was sent off favourite for his handicap debut at Kempton four weeks ago, only to finish in midfield; still has time on his side but he's in a warm event here so interesting to see if his backers return.

🔦 Spotlight: Promising third at Kempton on debut (7f) and he still looked a work in progress when getting up late to win a Chelmsford maiden eight days later, hanging sharply left in the closing stages; retains potential but that form isn't working out.
