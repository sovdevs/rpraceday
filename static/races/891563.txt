🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 9yo who's threatening to win another race and this trip and track are fine; respected
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who has been beaten 16 times since scoring last July (his 11th success) but a runner-up on two of his last five starts, including here (1m, good to firm), and he ran respectably when third at Beverley (about 1m, good) last week; threatening to win another one and he stays this trip; respected.
Horse quote: 2019-05-14 at Chepstow (8f): "Light Up Our Stars ran a grand race at Newbury on his seasonal comeback on very soft ground and the quick conditions here have helped him. We will have to see how the handicapper looks at the result before making a little plan - Richard Hughes, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Largely consistent (albeit without winning) from 1m2f to 1m4f last season but she made a quiet return at Bath (1m3.5f, good to firm) this month; nothing wrong with her mark if she steps forward from that, though, and her yard's ticking away nicely.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Couple of good hurdle runs lately but just okay on Flat before (AW); tries a tongue-tie
🔦 Spotlight: Three turf Flat wins at 1m2f in 2021, twice on good to firm and once over C&D (good); has been hurdling, with two good efforts coming either side of a poor one, but she was only running to an okay level on the Flat during the winter; today's new tongue-tie might help, though, and she's dropped to a career-low mark.
Horse quote: 2021-08-31 at Epsom (10f): "Arenas Del Tiempo wears her heart on her sleeve and is going in the right direction. She's rangey and can get a bit excitable, but I think she can go on with another winter under her belt. She's suited to Epsom - the twists and turns - and I'm already thinking what we can do with her here next year - Simon Dow, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Both wins came here last year but chance depends on whether he's ready to go off a break
🔦 Spotlight: Both wins came here last year, the first on good to firm ground (1m4f) and the second over this trip (good) in September; narrowly prevailed off 2lb lower in the latter and he's been absent since October; chance depends on whether he's ready to go on this return (has a modest record fresh).
Horse quote: 2024-08-20 at Brighton (12f): "Fighting Poet doesn't wear blinkers for fashion purposes and things had to go right, but he's got the talent to run well. After his last run, he seems to be improving a little bit recently and we've changed his training regime a little bit. Leah [Brundle], who looks after him, has done a great job. They're a great couple and I'm delighted for them. I'm also delighted for the Adlestrop Club. They are wonderfully enthusiastic people and we've had some fun over the years and it's nice to finally get his head in front for them - Trainer Richard Phillips, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: 1m4f AW win in January but not quite as good since; back down in trip on return to turf
🔦 Spotlight: Last six starts on AW; off the mark at Wolverhampton (1m4f) in January, his second start since being ✂️ gelded, but hasn't quite matched that form in four subsequent runs, twice a beaten favourite (once at odds-on); dropped back in trip on this return to turf and remains above his winning mark.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-10 on turf; went close in an AW Lingfield classified (1m2f) in March, his second start for Tony Carroll, but below that form over 9.5f one week later; course debut and it's still early days for this yard, which tends to know a Brighton horse when it sees one.
Horse quote: 2021-01-30 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "Big Narstie has a great attitude and is still learning and did that nicely. Thanks to Phil Cunningham for keeping me on him after his run in France - Hayley Turner, jockey."
