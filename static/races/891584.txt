🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at this meeting last year but has run poorly since.
🔦 Spotlight: Won at this meeting last year but has run poorly since; hood worn previously replaces the blinkers adopted last time.
Horse quote: 2024-05-02 at Ayr (7f): "I came here today fancying Zebra Star a lot more than than Ski Angel (trainer's later winner). This mare has changed. Clyde Vets were fantastic and we found a sinus problem and operated to sort it at the tail end of last year. It's definitely helped her and she's getting stronger and better all the time, and I think she'll stay further.   She's taken a wee bit of time to grow and has just matured over the winter - Mike Smith, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."
