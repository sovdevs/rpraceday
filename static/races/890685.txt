🔦 Spotlight: Irish-trained gelding who has a US pedigree; two from two, both wins over 1m at Southwell; faces a stiffer task on bare figures upped in grade but is a promising type who could well rate higher.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "Michael Scofield knew his job you know, and I thought we went fairly even (gallop) throughout. He showed a nice turn of foot, and I think he's a horse that will probably get ten furlongs - Kieran Shoemark, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
