🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A two-time C&D winner; resumed with encouraging C&D third; a likely player eased 1lb
🔦 Spotlight: A two-time C&D winner in 2024 and she wasn't seen to ideal effect after seven months off when a staying-on third over C&D 18 days ago; a likely player eased 1lb.
Horse quote: 2024-06-03 at Brighton (8f): "Cieren [Fallon, jockey] gave Blenheim Star a sensible ride and she won with a fair bit in hand again. It's nice when they handle a track like Brighton as you're always happy to go back. Hopefully there's more improvement in her, I think she'd benefit for a step up to a mile and a quarter - William Knight, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat one on recent return over C&D; this five-time course winner can take a step forward
🔦 Spotlight: Signed off for 2024 with 7f success here (fifth win at the track) but he went without his usual cheekpieces when beating only one on his seasonal return over C&D 18 days ago; he can take a step forward now.

🔦 Spotlight: On a long losing run and well beaten on his last two starts, the latest when going off too fast at Wolverhampton on Monday (8.6f, cheekpieces first time); headgear off today but enough to prove.

💬 Comment: C&D winner but he arrives under a cloud; others are much preferred
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner but he arrives under a cloud, last of nine in 8.5f Wolverhampton handicap 29 days ago; others are much preferred.
Horse quote: 2023-02-17 at Southwell (AW) (7f): "After Local Bay's win last week the only thing we had in the back of our minds was the bounce factor, backing him up too quickly. He's one of those horses that needs that early gallop to drop his head and get into a rhythm - Jack Mitchell, rider, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
