🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had solid bumper/hurdle record before easily winning modest race in February; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Has a pretty solid record in bumpers/over hurdles and did not need to improve to win four-runner Bangor maiden (2m, heavy) very comfortably in February; should also be suited by today's trip-and-ground combination, and has a big role to play.
Horse quote: 2025-02-26 at Bangor-on-Dee (16.5f): "I should have won a bumper on I've Madeupmymind before this but she's a little terrier - Ben Jones, jockey."
