🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big chance on Irish form but hard to recommend on last year's efforts for this yard
🔦 Spotlight: Showed a fair level of ability in six runs for Aidan O'Brien (peak RPR of 88); well beaten in three runs for this yard last summer though and he returns with plenty to prove; now visored.

🔦 Spotlight: Kempton debut in January (1m3f) wasn't without hope but he failed to progress when dropped to 1m back at Kempton 16 days ago; likely to be of more interest once handicapping.
