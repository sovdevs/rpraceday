🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: They went very steady at Ascot and he got outpaced; still ran a promising race
🔦 Spotlight: 130,000euros 3yo and the dam was very useful for Paul Nicholls; fourth of six runners when second favourite at Ascot (good) and it's unlikely that a steady pace would have benefited him; can improve.

💬 Comment: Close up at Huntingdon behind a previous winner and should have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Dam had modest form but closely related to smart jumper My Drogo; weak in the market (18-1) but was beaten only 6l at Huntingdon (good to soft) and he wasn't far behind John Barbour who had won the time before and has since finished second over hurdles; this 5yo should have more to offer.

💬 Comment: Ran well under a penalty at Sandown (heavy) and his form sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £40,000 after finishing close up in his two Irish points; won at Sandown (good to soft) from a subsequent winner and ran well under a penalty back there on heavy ground; Freddie Mitchell's claim eases the penalty this afternoon and his form sets the standard.
