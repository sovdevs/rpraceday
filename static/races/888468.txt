🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First and a close third on last two outings, both from rear over 7f on Polytrack
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Dermot Weld; came good at Chelmsford in February on second attempt for 🆕 new yard and close third at Kempton (again 7f on Polytrack) three weeks ago, from the rear on both occasions under Rossa Ryan but also hanging left; has a bit more to prove back at 6f but it looks like she's been held up to settle.

💬 Comment: 1m win in January with first blinkers; free-going front-runner this year at 1m/7f
🔦 Spotlight: 13 races with one win, in a handicap at Lingfield (1m, Polytrack) in January with first-time blinkers; they have been kept since with lesser returns, although he was a creditable third at Chelmsford (7f) on penultimate start; unraced over as short as 6f since last June but he's been a free-going front-runner throughout this year, so maybe it's worth a go; drawn wide.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handicap debut should be much more realistic and she needs a close look at in the betting
🔦 Spotlight: Probably showed most in the second of her three races, all on AW early this year; this handicap debut should be much more realistic and she needs a close look at in the betting.

🔦 Spotlight: Left David Loughnane for 1,000gns in November; never dangerous over 5f here on recent stable/handicap debut but the run caught the attention of the Stewards, who noted the rider's explanation; likely capable of a fair bit better at some point.

🔦 Spotlight: 80-1 under Joe Bradnam for handicap debut at Southwell (6f, Tapeta) 18 days ago but it's her most solid form, making late gains to be beaten 2l in sixth of ten after trouble in running over 1f out; has more to offer but also a wide draw.
