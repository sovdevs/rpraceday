🔦 Spotlight: Prominent racer; ended 2024 in fine form and he's run well in both starts back from a five-month break, latterly beaten a head into second of ten at Kempton (1m) last week; runs off the same mark and he's high on the list.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not seen to best effect on his reappearance 19 days ago; good mark on 2024 best
🔦 Spotlight: Ended 2024 quietly and he finished down the field on his reappearance at Bath 19 days ago, albeit he didn't get a clear run at it; well treated on last summer's best.
Horse quote: 2023-07-26 at Lingfield (7f): "Monks Mead was very green at Windsor and Chelmsford, and then just ran in what looks like a good race at Newbury. I thought Ollie (Searle) gave him an excellent ride. I must say I was surprised the odds were so big because it's not a massive surprise he has shown some ability today - Mark Usher, trainer."
