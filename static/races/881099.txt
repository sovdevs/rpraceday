🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Outstanding stayer who has won the last two Gold Cups; big chance of making it three
🔦 Spotlight: The great staying champion of our time who would be defending an unbeaten 4-4 record at the Festival but for crumpling after the last in the 2022 Turners Novices' Chase; his jumping hasn't always been a thing of beauty but he has learned his lessons well and his only defeats since that mishap have come right at the end and the beginning of his seasons; he's maintained a very high standard when winning two Grade 1s at Leopardstown (good to yielding and yielding) in midwinter and his dominance in the Gold Cup for the last two years looks set to continue.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First 3m chase run when winning King George; has further to go on a much stiffer finish
🔦 Spotlight: Nearly all chase runs at up to about 2m4f; however, he had looked a stayer in the making when making light of this steep finish in the Martin Pipe (2m4f) over hurdles here in 2022 and he laid out his stamina credentials when steaming home to win the 3m King George at Kempton (good; cheekpieces refitted) on Boxing Day; has a very good chance of breathing down Galopin Des Champs' neck on the home bend but will need special reserves to outstay that steely rival.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big 🚀 improver when winning the Kim Muir and a Grade 1 last spring; coming to hand; a threat
🔦 Spotlight: Staying trips were a big help last spring when winning the Kim Muir here (3m2f) with authority and moving seamlessly back into Grade 1 company to follow up in the 3m1f novice (again on soft) at Aintree; has offered no great opposition to Galopin Des Champs this winter but he looked to be coming to hand at Leopardstown in February and this greater test can suit; has been supplemented by owner who's also represented by Corbetts Cross and time is still on his side.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: High class as novice; just two runs this term; creditable show latest; open to improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Has found his calling over fences and was a good second in the Brown Advisory here (3m, soft) last March; he's had just two runs this winter and although turned over on his return to action in January, he ran well for a long way when beaten nearly 8l behind Galopin Des Champs at Leopardstown (3m, good to yielding) in February; it's possible that run was still needed but the stamina question for this test is still up in the air.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at 3m6f here last March; strong form at Aintree after; return to staying trip helpful
🔦 Spotlight: Strong stayer who made short work of his rivals in the National Hunt Chase here (3m6f, heavy) last March and showed he could do more than just grind away when close up in the Bowl (3m1f, soft) at Aintree after; unable to go with Banbridge in the home straight in the King George at Kempton (3m) on Boxing Day and his pace was again lacking over 2m5f at Ascot (good) last month, but this test can see him back in a good place; a dollop of rain would help but he isn't a forlorn hope.

🔦 Spotlight: Had a season to remember two winters ago when three front-running course wins included the Brown Advisory (3m, soft) at this meeting; success has been harder since he left novice company, though, and he was pulled up in this race 12 months ago; back on song with a Wetherby Grade 2 win (3m, good) in November but so much more is needed today.

🔦 Spotlight: Has some good efforts at about 3m1f in his record but he was pulled up in last year's Gold Cup (25-1) and, after finishing a respectable third to Galopin Des Champs at Leopardstown after Christmas, he wasn't at his best in a Grade 2 here last time out; his form needs an upgrade and others look better equipped for the stamina test; has been tongue tied or worn cheekpieces in recent starts, no aids today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Just respectable form in three previous Gold Cups; down on his luck in latest two starts
🔦 Spotlight: No more than respectable form in three attempts at this race and Haydock is his track, albeit that he has looked down on his luck in two starts there since returning from a layoff with a big win (3m1f, soft) in November; has a big question mark hanging over him now.
