💬 Comment: Just prevailed in blanket finish over 6f here last week; better than this grade but quirky
🔦 Spotlight: You couldn't set your watch by him but he's operating at a low level now and he retains a chunk of ability, as when coming from off the pace to win in a four-way photo over 6f here last week; has to be played late and he wasn't helping his rider close home last time but this is a lesser race and he's a strong contender.

💬 Comment: Just prevailed in blanket finish over 6f here last week; better than this grade but quirky
🔦 Spotlight: You couldn't set your watch by him but he's operating at a low level now and he retains a chunk of ability, as when coming from off the pace to win in a four-way photo over 6f here last week; has to be played late and he wasn't helping his rider close home last time but this is a lesser race and he's a strong contender.

💬 Comment: Just prevailed in blanket finish over 6f here last week; better than this grade but quirky
🔦 Spotlight: You couldn't set your watch by him but he's operating at a low level now and he retains a chunk of ability, as when coming from off the pace to win in a four-way photo over 6f here last week; has to be played late and he wasn't helping his rider close home last time but this is a lesser race and he's a strong contender.
