💬 Comment: Just prevailed in blanket finish over 6f here last week; better than this grade but quirky
🔦 Spotlight: You couldn't set your watch by him but he's operating at a low level now and he retains a chunk of ability, as when coming from off the pace to win in a four-way photo over 6f here last week; has to be played late and he wasn't helping his rider close home last time but this is a lesser race and he's a strong contender.

🏠 Owner: Allerton Racing & G Tuer
💬 Comment: Not the force of old but handicapped accordingly; has gone well fresh; betting to guide
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 6f handicap here in November 2023, recording an RPR of 66 in the process; little to celebrate on turf last year but he has gone well fresh in the past and any market confidence would look significant with blinkers given another airing.

🔦 Spotlight: One-time useful sprinter but his powers are on the wane; showed he could still cut it at this level when a close fourth over C&D last month but he'll need the pace to collapse if he's to end his barren spell.

💬 Comment: Just prevailed in blanket finish over 6f here last week; better than this grade but quirky
🔦 Spotlight: You couldn't set your watch by him but he's operating at a low level now and he retains a chunk of ability, as when coming from off the pace to win in a four-way photo over 6f here last week; has to be played late and he wasn't helping his rider close home last time but this is a lesser race and he's a strong contender.

💬 Comment: Just prevailed in blanket finish over 6f here last week; better than this grade but quirky
🔦 Spotlight: You couldn't set your watch by him but he's operating at a low level now and he retains a chunk of ability, as when coming from off the pace to win in a four-way photo over 6f here last week; has to be played late and he wasn't helping his rider close home last time but this is a lesser race and he's a strong contender.
