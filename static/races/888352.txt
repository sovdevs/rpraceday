🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: If as good as he was and not held back by his fitness after 233 days away, he'd go close
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Flat winner and was a smart juvenile hurdler two seasons ago, winning twice and competitive at the top level; handicapped accordingly and left Joseph O'Brien under a bit of a cloud, albeit when highly tried; if as good as he was and not held back by his fitness after 233 days away, he'd go close; unraced over this far as a hurdler but stayed well on the Flat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Progressing well until last time; will need his best form yet to take this
🔦 Spotlight: Won here in November and followed up on his handicap debut at Doncaster, again at about 2m; performed to a similar level when beaten in a novice two runs ago (2m3f) but then at 28-1 he never got involved in the Morebattle at Kelso; will need his best form yet to take this.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in this two years ago and returns after an excellent effort over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a strong Class 2 handicap chase at Doncaster 21 days ago that he won the previous season; does like that track (won over hurdles there in December) but he was runner-up in this two years ago when only 2lb lower; ran in first-time blinkers last time but he's very effective in cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His best form has been on heavy ground and conditions are a major turnoff
🔦 Spotlight: Best form has been on heavy ground, including his Haydock win just before Christmas (1m7f; 6lb lower); good to soft seemed to find him out at Kelso three weeks ago and conditions are again a turnoff.
