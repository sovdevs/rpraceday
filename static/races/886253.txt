🔦 Spotlight: The horse who beat him in a point has been competitive under rules and this 5yo now looks ready for a test of stamina after his one-paced fourth (beaten 24l) over 2m4f at Wincanton; has to step up but that's perfectly feasible.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In trouble a long way out when a market drifter on his hurdling debut (2m4f)
🔦 Spotlight: Showed a bit in his bumper (seventh of 13 on good to soft) but he was a market drifter when in trouble a good way out on his switch to hurdling at Plumpton (2m4f, soft); others have more pressing claims.
