🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came with strong run from off pace to make winning handicap debut over C&D; should go well
🔦 Spotlight: Came with a strong run from well off the pace to get up in the final strides on his C&D handicap debut and reappearance 11 days ago; nudged up only 2lb and the style of that success suggests he should have more to offer.

🔦 Spotlight: Mixed form in three turf runs last summer but she found improvement on handicap debut when going very close over 6f here (5-2 favourite) in January; nudged up 2lb but she was strong at the finish last time and is a 🔥 big player again at this new trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hails from a leading stable and could prove a different proposition in handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: No better than modest form in three starts over 7f but the fact that she went off at 3-1 for the first two suggests she must have been showing something at home; likely 🚀 improver in handicaps for a leading stable; market confidence significant.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Changed yard since C&D handicap debut sixth; could only consider if backed
🔦 Spotlight: Modest form at best in four runs for the William Muir and Chris Grassick stable, including sixth of eight on C&D handicap debut 47 days ago; 🆕 new yard removes the tongue-tie she's worn the last twice and replaces it with a hood; could only consider if backed.
