🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a point in May 2024, pulled up last two starts, hood and tongue tie now tried
🔦 Spotlight: Won a mares' maiden point-to-point at Necarne in May 2024; pulled up on Rules' debut at Clonmel in January and similar outcome back in a point-to-point at Knockanard; first time hood and tongue tie needs to spark a revival.
