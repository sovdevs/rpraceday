Horse quote: 2024-12-21 at Haydock (24.5f): "We've always thought a lot of Supremely West. He's got good form but was too keen last time at Hexham. He loves this ground and although he has the blinkers on, he's so game and honest - Charlie Hammond, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of sorts since chase win but this is a drop back in class and mark is workable
🔦 Spotlight: Useful over hurdles and fences on his day; out of sorts since chase success last May but this is a drop back in class and mark is workable on best form.
Horse quote: 2022-12-09 at Cheltenham (24f): "Captain Morgs is a good little horse. He is consistent, consistently second. When he was second at Kempton to Call Me Lord, Nico (de Boinville) was a bit frustrated so I put the cheekpieces on and that helped - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who has proved far from consistent since winning a Pertemps qualifier at Chepstow 14 months ago; not the percentage call.
Horse quote: 2020-11-13 at Fairyhouse (23.5f): "Classic Concorde lost his way last and after his last run we were wondering whether to give up on him, but we gave him a break and decided to have one more go. We might give him another one after that! We'll see what the handicapper does - Andy McNamara, trainer."
