🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has more ability than we've seen but handicaps over further will be more suitable
🔦 Spotlight: C&D debut was more promising than the distance beaten suggests and latest run at Southwell also offered hope of better; that improvement may well come when handicapping over longer trips.
