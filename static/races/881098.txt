🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this in good style 12 months ago and will be tough to beat if repeating that form
🔦 Spotlight: Close third in this in 2023 and won it 12 months ago (soft) before following up in Grade 1 at Punchestown (2m7f, yielding), again with something to spare; just one run since but that was a fair second to Lossiemouth over an inadequate 2m4f at Fairyhouse in December, and he had the identical preparation route last season; will be tough to beat if reproducing last March's form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3m handicap win here in October; steady pace against him in the Long Walk; one to consider
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a four-timer (good-yielding) when storming up the hill in 3m handicap on the Old Course here in October; stayed on well for fourth in Grade 1 Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot (3m, good to soft) in December when the steady early pace counted against him; could improve on that latest form now he's back here, particularly if he gets a stronger gallop; one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 1 win last time; can give a good account but has come up short in this in the past
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable efforts when fifth in this in 2023 (soft) and 6l third 12 months ago (soft); won by 6l in the Savills Hurdle at Leopardstown (extended 2m7f, yielding) in December, having also landed that Grade 1 in 2022; it seems likely this 10yo will again find one or more too strong now he's having another tilt at the Stayers' Hurdle, but he can give another good account.

💬 Comment: Tends to come alive at the Cheltenham Festival; intriguing contender now back up to 3m
🔦 Spotlight: Soundly beaten on all three starts this season but tends to come alive at the Cheltenham Festival and he made it back-to-back wins in the Coral Cup Handicap here last March (2m5f, soft); very close third in the Grade 1 Aintree Hurdle (2m4f, soft) next time; stayed on well for second in Sandown Grade 2 (extended 2m5f, good) last April and the return to 3m could be right up his street if he stages his usual March renaissance; intriguing contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Twice second to Home By The Lee this season; the return to Cheltenham could be a plus
🔦 Spotlight: 3-3 at Cheltenham including twice at the Festival (albeit fortuitously in 2022); went very close in Grade 1 Aintree Hurdle (2m4f, soft) last April and he's been a respectable second to Home By The Lee on his two starts this season (2m4f/extended 2m7f, yielding); needs something extra today but the return to Cheltenham could be a plus; not ruled out each-way.

💬 Comment: Grade 2 winner last time; only five and very lightly raced but needs sizeable step forward
🔦 Spotlight: 66-1 third behind Home By The Lee and Bob Olinger in Grade 1 Savills Hurdle at Leopardstown (2m7f, yielding) in December and won the Grade 2 Galmoy at Gowran Park (3m, soft to heavy) in January to make it three wins from his six starts; good chance this very lightly raced 5yo has more to offer but a sizeable step forward is needed in today's company.

🔦 Spotlight: Made it back-to-back wins in the Grade 1 Long Walk Hurdle (3m, good/good to soft) when scoring at Ascot in December; each-way claims on his best form but yet to shine at Cheltenham, having finished ninth in this last year and been soundly beaten (bad mistake) in the Cleeve Hurdle over C&D in January.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a hat-trick (2m3f/2m4f, good to soft/soft) when getting up close home in Grade 2 National Spirit at Fontwell last month; goes up in trip and back up in grade today, with something to find, but he stayed well on the Flat early in his career and has shaped this season as though today's extra distance could prompt further improvement; clearly thriving; interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has done very well in handicap chases here at about 2m4f; doubts about hurdles and trip
🔦 Spotlight: 1-3 over hurdles, the win in France in 2019; has done very well in valuable handicap chases here at about 2m4f and he was running well when a final-fence faller over 3m at Doncaster in January 2023; however, there's still a stamina doubt today and also a question mark regarding the return to hurdles.

🔦 Spotlight: Fifth in last year's Coral Cup here (2m5f, soft) and won Punchestown handicap (3m, soft) in November before following up in a conditions hurdle at Clonmel (3m, yielding); good third to Rocky's Diamond in Grade 2 at Gowran Park (3m, soft to heavy) last time but he'd be a surprise winner today.
