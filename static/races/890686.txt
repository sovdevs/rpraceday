🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off since ready Goodwood success last May but still potentially useful
🔦 Spotlight: Made a good start to his career on turf last May, finishing second over 5f at Bath before readily seeing off nine rivals at Goodwood (6f); his length of absence is a bit of a concern but he looked a useful prospect.
Horse quote: 2024-05-24 at Goodwood (6f): "Red Sand was angelic in the prelims and I loved how straight and true he was. I didn't have company from a long way out but he never felt like being beaten. I loved the way he hit the line and he galloped out really well. He's a classy animal. He travelled well over five at Bath last time and I think the team expected him to be a little green that day. He's a proper professional and the response was immediate when I pressed the button. I don't see why he couldn't [be a Royal Ascot horse]. A stiff six furlongs would suit him there - Saffie Osborne, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready winner at Kempton in December and holds an entry in the 2,000 Guineas
🔦 Spotlight: Promising third on 6f turf debut before easily justifying short-priced favouritism over 7f on AW at Kempton; that bare form is nothing to get carried away with but a 2,000 Guineas entry suggests this Dark Angel colt is well regarded.

💬 Comment: Showed when reaching frame twice on turf as a juvenile; more to come in 2025
🔦 Spotlight: Fourth to subsequent Group 2 winner Bay City Roller on 7f fast-ground Sandown debut last summer; couldn't improve on that form when a beaten favourite at Yarmouth (7f again) on a softer surface 11 weeks later but it was no bad run and he remains open to improvement.

💬 Comment: Promise over 7f/1m on turf last year; has been ✂️ gelded; almost certainly has more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Out of an unraced half-sister to his yard's 6f/7f Group 1 winner Kinross; promising third in maidens at Newmarket (7f) and Goodwood (1m) last August; a bit keen at the latter venue and reverts to 7f on return with the hood he wore on debut back in place; has been ✂️ gelded; almost certainly capable of better this year.
