🔦 Spotlight: He's finished second a lot more often than he's won but this useful hurdler has potential off his Flat mark and was a good second when back in this code at Musselburgh (2m, good) last Wednesday; key player.

🔦 Spotlight: Mixed form over fences this year but was a good second in that sphere two starts ago (2m, good); won over C&D (soft) last October on penultimate Flat run and he's capable of having a big say if he's on a going day.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Haydock (2m, good) last June; unable to get competitive on the Flat and over hurdles subsequently last year but the reapplied cheekpieces may help and he's not written off, now 4lb lower than for last win.
