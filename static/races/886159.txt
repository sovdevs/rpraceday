🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stylish win on hurdle debut; bumps into class act in Wendigo, but a very nice prospect
🔦 Spotlight: 3m point runner-up and good-ground bumper winner who defied an absence to win readily on last month's hurdle and stable debut at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft); bumps into a class act in Wendigo today but a very nice prospect himself and could have lots more to offer.
