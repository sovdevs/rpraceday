🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a competitive mark but there are doubts about his current form and this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: He's on a competitive mark on his best form but he's been unable to show it in these cheekpieces on his last two starts; now 1-14 and he's unraced beyond 8.6f; a return to form is needed now up in trip.
