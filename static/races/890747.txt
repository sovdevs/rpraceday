🔦 Spotlight: Two chase wins last season came in Graded novices at Punchestown and Limerick on testing ground; has contested very competitive handicaps this term, notably good thirds in both Thyestes at Gowran and 3m3f National Trial at Punchestown last month; welcome drop in class here, though ground quicker than ideal.

🔦 Spotlight: All three chase wins on soft/heavy but none since early 2023; creditable comeback run over 3m at Ayr in January, out of depth back hurdling since; cheekpieces now added to usual tongue-tie; ground not ideal but has his chance in a poor turnout.

🔦 Spotlight: Career highlight when winning 3m5f Ulster National at Downpatrick last season on good ground; good bit below that level this term however, most recently when cheekpieces tried in Troytown at Navan in November; back from a break with ground to suit and definite chance of troubling stablemate Favori De Champdou at the weights if near her best.
