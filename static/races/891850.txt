🔦 Spotlight: Has a better strike-rate on turf than on AW but ran respectably at big odds in the Vase Marathon at Lingfield most recently; drops back in grade off last winning mark; possibilities.
Horse quote: 2023-09-30 at Chester (14.5f): "Dreams Adozen handled the ground. It's absolutely bottomless but she ploughed through it, maybe the others didn't go in the ground - Joe Fanning, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two good performances (won/second) at Nottingham since wearing visor; enters calculations
🔦 Spotlight: Good performances at Nottingham since wearing visor, opening his Flat account in 1m6f contest then a good second over 2m, both last autumn; likely player if picking up where left off.
Horse quote: 2024-10-24 at Nottingham (14f): "It's very testing out there. The plan wasn't to be that far back but Hardy Bloke half missed it. But they eased up down the back and it was very straightforward from there. With every run he's got quicker, it was two miles and two furlongs last time. He's very versatile - Ben Robinson, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2021-09-04 at Haydock (14f): "It's pretty fast out there. The first two winners made all, it's suiting the front runners and Joe Fanning is the master of it - though, to be fair to Golden Flame, he looked as though he was the last off the bridle there - Jock Bennett, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not particularly solid on AW results and it's three years since last start in this sphere
🔦 Spotlight: Form dipped markedly in last appearance, when bidding for a turf hat-trick; not particularly solid on AW results and it's three years since his last attempt in this sphere.
Horse quote: 2024-04-02 at Pontefract (18f): "Staying won the day and this ground is the key to him. Justus did well over hurdles and he stayed on well after getting outpaced here -  Micky Hammond, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Hard to recommend on his hurdles form for current yard; however, two attempts on AW (both in 2022) include a 2m Kempton win off 9lb higher; interesting on belated return to this sphere.
