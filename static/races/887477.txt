💬 Comment: Game win in a 6f handicap at Southwell eight days ago; 🔥 big player despite a 2lb rise
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the 14th attempt when narrowly landing a 6f handicap at Southwell eight days ago; 2lb rise to deal with but fully effective at 5f and he's well drawn; more appealing than many.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Better than the bare result on h'cap debut latest and that race was red hot for the grade
🔦 Spotlight: No immediate improvement for the switch to handicaps at Newcastle in January but there was quite a bit of promise in the run, held up and travelling strongly but unable to claw back the principals; that was a red-hot race, however, with the first two both thriving and the third winning next time too; still has time to do better and she's of some interest dropped 3lb.

🔦 Spotlight: First signs of promise when a close fourth on her handicap debut here five weeks ago, racing freely and messed about a bit early in the race; unconsidered 80-1 shot in the betting that day and she could have more to come; drop to 5f presents a different test; betting instructive in relation to her two stablemates.
