🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point winner in 2023 and a clear second on recent hurdling debut; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Won a soft-ground Irish point in November 2023 and, following a long absence, made pretty good start to rules career when clear second of six at Hereford (2m, soft) last month; that form already makes her a leading contender here, and she has obvious scope for improvement.
