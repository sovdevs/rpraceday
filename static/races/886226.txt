🔦 Spotlight: Below par in Sedgefield novice three weeks ago but the soft ground may not have been ideal; won maiden hurdle there (2m4f, good) in November before fair third under penalty at Catterick (1m7f, good), and she could be involved on her handicap debut if today's surface is suitable.

🔦 Spotlight: 11yo who won at Market Rasen (2m, good to soft) a fortnight ago and a 3lb rise may not stop her if she can repeat that form; however, Market Rasen brings out the best in her and she failed to shine on her sole run here.

🔦 Spotlight: Creditable third for Ian Donoghue at Navan (2m, yielding) in November and a case can be made on that form; however, she was well beaten the next twice and changed hands for £4,000 last month; a return to form is needed on today's stable debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tailed off on recent comeback at Sedgefield when 50-1 and it's hard to be confident
🔦 Spotlight: 2-37 over hurdles when trained in Ireland; some fair efforts for Shark Hanlon in the first half of last year and she may have needed her recent stable debut when tailed off at Sedgefield at 50-1, but it's hard to be confident on the back of that latest performance.
