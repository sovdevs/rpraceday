🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over 2m3f on handicap debut and able to run off 2lb lower today; goes up in trip again
🔦 Spotlight: 5yo who showed improved form and won when upped to 2m3f for last Wednesday's handicap debut at Wetherby; that was a conditionals'/amateurs' race so he escapes a penalty and is actually 2lb lower today; there's stamina in his pedigree and he should be tough to beat if seeing out this longer trip.

💬 Comment: Lightly raced 3m point runner-up who could be suited by step up in trip now back hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: 6yo who kept on well for close fourth on his handicap and chase debut at Taunton (2m2f, good to soft) in November; failed to back that up at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) but this 3m point runner-up could be suited by the step up in trip now back hurdling; intriguing contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Won in first-time cheekpieces (retained since) at Ffos Las (2m4f, good to soft) in November and back to form with fair third of ten at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) recently; shaped last time as though this step back up in trip would be a plus and she went close over 3m1f last August; chance.

💬 Comment: Tailed off on handicap debut after a break but in top hands and showed promise previously
🔦 Spotlight: Tailed off on handicap debut at Exeter (2m5f, good to soft) in December, following a break; however, this very lightly raced 6yo is in top hands and showed signs of promise in a maiden hurdle at Kempton (2m5f, good) last May; no surprise if he's a different proposition to last time.

🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up over fences the last twice and 0-11 under rules; however, he had a positive reaction to cheekpieces when placed twice in a row over hurdles last spring, and it's possible the first-time blinkers and return to this sphere will give him a boost; down the weights; not a forlorn hope.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up over fences last week but in fair form over hurdles previously; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Made it 0-20 under rules when pulled up over fences at Ayr last week; however, before that he posted two fair runs over hurdles (2m5f/2m) and shaped as though he would benefit from this longer trip; well treated on last spring's chase form; could appreciate the return to hurdling; interesting.
