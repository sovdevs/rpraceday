🔦 Spotlight: Sole win was over fences at Hereford (2m, good) in November 2023 but that was off 9lb higher and he was beaten less than 4l when third at Southwell (2m, good to soft) last month; could be dangerous if he can back that up but he still has stamina to prove over this far.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On long losing run but he's dropped a long way in weights and ran respectably last time
🔦 Spotlight: Six-time chase winner who has not scored since March 2022 but he's dropped a long way in the weights and ran respectably when fourth at Chepstow (2m3f, good) last month; has each-way claims if he can build on that.
Horse quote: 2021-02-19 at Fakenham (16.5f): "When Kap Auteuil is in behind he travels and jumps really nicely but he's idle and inexperienced in front still. So I was always going to make sure that once we were in the lead that his concentration was on the task. Toby [Lawes, trainer] is doing a good job and I think this horse can build on this win - Tom Cannon, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On long losing run but he's dropped a long way in weights and ran respectably last time
🔦 Spotlight: Six-time chase winner who has not scored since March 2022 but he's dropped a long way in the weights and ran respectably when fourth at Chepstow (2m3f, good) last month; has each-way claims if he can build on that.

💬 Comment: Generally very disappointing in recent years and is best watched after a year off
🔦 Spotlight: Useful when trained by Willie Mullins in Ireland as a younger horse but lightly raced and generally very disappointing in recent years; won a point on his penultimate run but he returns after a year off and is probably best watched on stable debut.
Horse quote: 2018-09-13 at Listowel (22f): "Paul found himself in a pocket the whole race as he thought they were going to go much faster but they didn't go a good gallop. When he switched out the horse seemed to find another gear. He's improved and hopefully can go on from here and win a few more chases. He's got a lovely pedigree - Willie Mullins, trainer"
