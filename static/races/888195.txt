🔦 Spotlight: Has found his level for this, his third, yard albeit he's been turned over as favourite the past twice and hasn't always found a lot; one of the likelier winners if first-time cheekpieces (often hooded) prove the answer.

🔦 Spotlight: Strong traveller who's up to winning off this mark on the evidence of three handicap starts (last two in a hood); today's course should suit but, like stablemate Baseline, he'll need to be more amenable in a small field back from a break.
