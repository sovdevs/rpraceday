🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Southwell 2nd (3m); looked to be showing much better form when falling at Doncaster (2m5f)
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden point and Musselburgh bumper winner; turned over at 4-5 in a small field for hurdling debut at Southwell (3m, good) but he appeared to be showing much better form with first-time cheekpieces in a maiden hurdle at Doncaster (2m5f, good to soft) in November before falling two out; 🔥 big player if avoiding mishaps this time.

🔦 Spotlight: Won British maiden point by 7l on debut in April 2023; absent until second this season in maiden hurdles at Fontwell (soft) in October and Ascot (extended 2m5f, good to soft) in December, making most in the latter and he has a big shout on that form; likely to stay too.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Southwell 2nd (3m); looked to be showing much better form when falling at Doncaster (2m5f)
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden point and Musselburgh bumper winner; turned over at 4-5 in a small field for hurdling debut at Southwell (3m, good) but he appeared to be showing much better form with first-time cheekpieces in a maiden hurdle at Doncaster (2m5f, good to soft) in November before falling two out; 🔥 big player if avoiding mishaps this time.

💬 Comment: Southwell 2nd (3m); looked to be showing much better form when falling at Doncaster (2m5f)
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden point and Musselburgh bumper winner; turned over at 4-5 in a small field for hurdling debut at Southwell (3m, good) but he appeared to be showing much better form with first-time cheekpieces in a maiden hurdle at Doncaster (2m5f, good to soft) in November before falling two out; 🔥 big player if avoiding mishaps this time.
