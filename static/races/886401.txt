🔦 Spotlight: 2-4 here, his latest win coming by a head over this trip in the middle of last month; probably put up an even better performance when beaten a neck at Kempton (7f, Polytrack) 11 days later and a major player back under these conditions despite 1lb rise.

💬 Comment: Only does the minimum and just 2lb higher in his bid for the four-timer; much respected
🔦 Spotlight: Completing a hat-trick recently with one win here (7f) and two at Southwell (7f/1m); those successes have only come narrowly so he may not be the easiest for the handicapper to keep tabs on; much respected off just 2lb higher in his bid for the four-timer.

🔦 Spotlight: Underwent wind surgery prior to making a successful stable debut over C&D in September, but his form has regressed since and he was beaten a long way at Southwell (1m, Tapeta) in December; however, he has had a second wind op since then so interesting to see how he fares.
