🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Most recent AW efforts give him a shout if he's as effective on this turf debut
🔦 Spotlight: 1m AW win as 2yo; missed most of 2024 but not far away in four of his five handicaps since; favourite when upped 1m6f and 2m for last two outings but appeared not to see it out; the latter was still a respectable effort, which gives him a shout if he's as effective on this turf debut.

💬 Comment: New trip may now be worth a go, despite pedigree, and he's relatively lightly raced
🔦 Spotlight: A dual 1m2f scorer on turf last summer and good second over 1m4f at Kempton (AW) 17 days ago; new trip may now be worth a go, despite pedigree, and he's relatively lightly raced.
Horse quote: 2024-08-17 at Newmarket (July) (10f): "I feel One Cool Dreamer will get a mile and a half. He enjoyed the good even pace and I thought he pulled out a bit more when the second, ridden by my father, came to me - David Egan, jockey."

💬 Comment: Went badly off boil on turf last year at about 1m; did well at 1m6f/2m this winter on AW
🔦 Spotlight: Stepped up in distance this winter and it's borne fruit, getting off the mark in a 1m6f handicap at Southwell in December and winning a 2m handicap at Chelmsford in February; he went badly off the boil on turf last year (about 1m) but should be more interesting over this trip.
Horse quote: 2024-12-19 at Southwell (AW) (14f): "I watched back Currumbin's last few races and it just looks like he stays. Today he relaxed beautifully, he took me there very comfortably and he won well - Kieren Shoemark, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Wolverhampton win (1m6f, AW) in March latest; last year he did much better on AW than turf
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wolverhampton (1m6f, AW) in March latest; won on good to firm in 2023 but it's a concern that last year he did much better on AW than turf.
Horse quote: 2024-07-07 at Chelmsford (AW) (13.5f): "If you looked at Cardano today he was looking a million dollars and Ben's horses have been running well all year. I remember working this horse when he was at Ian Williams's and he would be working with the likes of Enemy. He's an older horse now, but he still has massive enthusiasm for the game. The tricky thing today was the draw as Ben said he likes it when horses are coming at him. Once I managed to get to the lead he kept galloping and I simply had a massively willing partner - Ali Rawlinson, jockey."

💬 Comment: Last of 14 at Chelmsford (1m6f; 8-1) two weeks ago on AW/stable debut; headgear returns
🔦 Spotlight: Won 1m4f/1m6f handicaps in Ireland last summer and consistent form afterwards; left Johnny Murtagh for 52,000gns and has joined another good yard but he was last of 14 at Chelmsford (1m6f; 8-1) two weeks ago on AW debut; headgear (he ran creditably in some on three occasions in Ireland) returns.
Horse quote: 2024-05-20 at Roscommon (12f): "I thought the step up in trip would be a big help to Sixpack. It was a bit of a messy race here last time, they didn't go quick and didn't the gaps when he needed. Everything went to plan today, we went a nice even gallop and I was able to get the gap turning in. I thought he stayed on well to the line and the more racing the better he'll get - Ben Coen, jockey, speaking to Racing TV"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five wins last year; more to prove at 1m6f than 1m4f but has a good first-time-out record
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins last May-August, all over about 1m4f on turf; out of form on last two outings and more to prove at 1m6f (notwithstanding her second at Nottingham last July) but has a good first-time-out record.
Horse quote: 2024-07-18 at Leicester (12f): "We knew Lincoln Rockstar was really well but we weren't expecting that. She usually just does enough but she's put six behind them! She hit a flat spot during the race but we didn't expect she'd pick up in the way she did. She's entered at Musselburgh on Tuesday but we'll see how she comes out of this. We had a few races planned but the handicapper might take her off that. We'll have some fun with her - Ivan Furtado, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: This should be a competitive mark; ran only twice on turf, without a serious impact
🔦 Spotlight: Three AW wins (1m2f-2m) in 2023; missed nearly all of last year, with two creditable efforts on return but not quite so good in his two starts since; this should be a competitive mark but he's run only twice on turf and did not make a serious impact.
