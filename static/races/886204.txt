🔦 Spotlight: Had wind surgery before showing improved form to win at Newbury (2m4f, good to soft) in December; very strong at the finish that day and he was delivered late again when creditable third at Windsor (soft) three weeks later on step up to 3m; up another 2lb but in the mix.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Goes well for James Turner, last time holding off Kilbarry Hill in a game display over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Started this season over fences but better form since returned to hurdling; the last three wins of his wins (all on soft) came under James Turner, last time holding off Kilbarry Hill in a game performance over C&D; 4lb higher today but never better and needs respect.

💬 Comment: Fought back when short-headed here (near 2m6f, soft) latest, as first two drew 8l clear
🔦 Spotlight: Won last February in his first two runs; fell on chase debut in October but placed in all three of his handicap hurdles, on last two starts taking second at Kelso (extended 2m6f, good to soft) and Haydock (near 2m6f, soft); fought back to go down by a short head last time, as the first two drew 8l clear, and this lightly raced 7yo remains of major interest despite 5lb rise.

🔦 Spotlight: Won last spring on first two starts for this yard (C&D on first occasion) and ran well in defeat this season until first-time headgear seemingly had a negative effect on latest outing; those cheekpieces are now set aside again; has good record for claiming riders; career best is needed, though.

🔦 Spotlight: 3-5 over hurdles and he's won both his handicaps, getting up in the final strides at Wetherby (2m4f, good to soft) and Ayr (extended 3m, soft); up another 4lb in a better race but this is his first season under rules and this well-related 6yo should have more to give.

🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive last season and took another step forward when winning by 6l over C&D eight weeks ago; top performances have all been on heavy ground; that asks a question and he's also up another 10lb, but he dominated all the way up the straight last time and could have more to give.
