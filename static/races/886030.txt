🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2023 Kim Muir winner who hasn't been overly pressed to win her points this term
🔦 Spotlight: Past handicappers have a good record and this mare fits the bill, having won the Kim Muir here two years ago; she was challenging the thrown-in Inothewayurthinkin when falling two out in last season's edition of that same race; has gone 2-2 in points this term and had far too much for the respected Ryehill last time; worthy of her prominence in the betting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed at Thurles; a rising force and has now been snapped up to join Gordon Elliott
🔦 Spotlight: Initial point form in Ireland was nothing to crow about but his career has taken off since October, winning three points and impressive in a Thurles hunter chase last time (3m1f, good) where his jumping took the eye; the bare form of that race isn't overly strong but he won easily and the RPR was smart; looks a rising force and has since been snapped up by one of Gordon Elliott's powerful owners; now makes debut for that yard; has won on soft but drier ground could be the key to him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up the last two years; below par in last two races but too talented to be ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: His only defeat under rules during last season's highly productive campaign came when collared late on in this race, having also finished runner-up in it the year before as a 6yo; went on to win the big hunter chases at Aintree (2m5f, heavy; very easily) and Punchestown (3m, yielding) last spring; needs to right the wrongs of two disappointing runs in Irish hunter chases this winter (odds-on for both) - latterly behind Ryehill and Ontheropes - but he's way too talented to be left out of the reckoning; probably effective on any ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Remote fourth to Its On The Line at Punchestown last May but he's a scopey, lightly raced 8yo who has raised his game this winter, finishing 6l off Angels Dawn in a point before beating Ontheropes and Its On The Line with a degree of comfort at Naas (3m1f, soft); it could be that he ideally needs plenty of ease underfoot but interesting otherwise with his profile firmly on the up.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unbeaten over regulation fences; 2-2 in handicaps and likewise in hunter chases
🔦 Spotlight: Unbeaten over regulation fences, having won two handicaps at about 3m in 2023 and come back from a long absence to win hunter chases at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy) and Taunton (2m7f, good to soft); Haven't Time gave him something to think about last time and this demands more of him, probably a lot more; the cheekpieces he wore for those handicap wins are back on; Paul Nicholls has won this four times.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 here and this lightly raced 8yo has looked in good order in his latest points
🔦 Spotlight: Unbeaten in his two visits here (on good and soft), latterly when emerging from off the pace over C&D last May to beat the 2023 winner of this (Premier Magic); has a fair shout on that form and this track probably suits him better than Stratford where later that month he was ridden more prominently and finished just under 5l behind What A Glance; arrives here with confidence buoyed after no-nonsense wins between the flags; merits attention.

🔦 Spotlight: Eighth in the 2022 Champion Bumper for Gordon Elliott and was twice placed here over hurdles; this is a very belated return to rules action and he lacks any experience of regulation fences, but he's been impressive enough in his recent points to be quite a market mover for this; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner last May and followed up at Stratford; stays further so should be running on
🔦 Spotlight: Won at the hunter chase meeting here last May (3m1f, soft) and followed up in Stratford's Horse And Hound Cup (3m3f, good), latter at the expense of Lift Me Up and a below-par Fairly Famous; won't fail through a lack of stamina and recent point defeats weren't shoddy efforts by any means.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off since early November but has a positive jockey booking and brings each-way hopes
🔦 Spotlight: Only three runs over regulation fences but he was third in a Grade 2 in 2022 and fourth in a good novice handicap here in late 2023; signed off for the Bowen yard last summer with respectable runs over hurdles and hasn't been overly pressed to win two small-field points in Ireland for this stable; positive jockey booking and brings each-way hopes provided a 131-day break doesn't come back to bite him.

💬 Comment: Last season's Scottish National fifth and assured stamina ticks a big box in this race
🔦 Spotlight: Won the 2021 Munster National for Willie Mullins and contested plenty of other strong handicaps for that yard, not beaten far in last season's Scottish National; best days are surely behind him now at 11, but he won a point in January and ran well when dividing Ryehill and Its On The Line at Naas (3m1f, soft); assured stamina ticks a big box and he could have some say.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Warwick winner but on the balance of form a minor role looks on the cards
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 9yo; beat a talented hunter chaser when wearing the new cheekpieces at Warwick (3m, good to soft) last time; has appreciably more on his plate now and was a long way behind Fairly Famous here last May; the latter was not at his best when those placings were reversed at Stratford later in the month (both behind What A Glance); a minor role looks on the cards.

🔦 Spotlight: Had flashes of good form when with Gavin Cromwell but was inconsistent; won a point and a hunter chase (cheekpieces returned) within the space of 12 days last month but it's very questionable  whether he can mix it with the best of today's opposition.

💬 Comment: Excuses at Fakenham last time but his overall form credentials are not persuasive
🔦 Spotlight: Eight wins over rules fences include two hunter chases last year; joined this yard for £30,000 in October; suited by good ground but he was too free for his own good after a break when tailed off behind Bardenstown Lad at Fakenham; even should he give himself a greater chance here, his form credentials aren't that persuasive; cheekpieces return.
