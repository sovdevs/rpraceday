üí¨ Comment: 2023 Kim Muir winner who hasn't been overly pressed to win her points this term
üî¶ Spotlight: Past handicappers have a good record and this mare fits the bill, having won the Kim Muir here two years ago; she was challenging the thrown-in Inothewayurthinkin when falling two out in last season's edition of that same race; has gone 2-2 in points this term and had far too much for the respected Ryehill last time; worthy of her prominence in the betting.

üí¨ Comment: Impressed at Thurles; a rising force and has now been snapped up to join Gordon Elliott
üî¶ Spotlight: Initial point form in Ireland was nothing to crow about but his career has taken off since October, winning three points and impressive in a Thurles hunter chase last time (3m1f, good) where his jumping took the eye; the bare form of that race isn't overly strong but he won easily and the RPR was smart; looks a rising force and has since been snapped up by one of Gordon Elliott's powerful owners; now makes debut for that yard; has won on soft but drier ground could be the key to him.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Runner-up the last two years; below par in last two races but too talented to be ruled out
üî¶ Spotlight: His only defeat under rules during last season's highly productive campaign came when collared late on in this race, having also finished runner-up in it the year before as a 6yo; went on to win the big hunter chases at Aintree (2m5f, heavy; very easily) and Punchestown (3m, yielding) last spring; needs to right the wrongs of two disappointing runs in Irish hunter chases this winter (odds-on for both) - latterly behind Ryehill and Ontheropes - but he's way too talented to be left out of the reckoning; probably effective on any ground.

üí¨ Comment: A scopey, lightly raced 8yo who impressed last time at Naas and he's on the up
üî¶ Spotlight: Remote fourth to Its On The Line at Punchestown last May but he's a scopey, lightly raced 8yo who has raised his game this winter, finishing 6l off Angels Dawn in a point before beating Ontheropes and Its On The Line with a degree of comfort at Naas (3m1f, soft); it could be that he ideally needs plenty of ease underfoot but interesting otherwise with his profile firmly on the up.

üí¨ Comment: Fourth in this two years ago when at the top of his game; that might not be the case now
üî¶ Spotlight: Had won five points on the bounce before finishing a 4l fourth in this two years ago and he won another three not long after, including a 4l defeat of Its On The Line; it's questionable whether he's quite in the same form now, despite getting his head back in front last time.

üí¨ Comment: Has the form to run a good race but he's an 11yo now and doesn't rate a likely winner
üî¶ Spotlight: Dual point winner who was a near 12l third to What A Glance at the hunter chase meeting here last May (3m1f, soft) and returned from a break to keep Shearer honest at Taunton (2m7f, good to soft) despite a bad mid-race mistake; could run well but is unlikely to be good enough at the age of 11.

üí¨ Comment: Behind Willitgoahead last time and has little hope of reversing those placings
üî¶ Spotlight: Won a hunter chase at Fairyhouse in November (3m, good) but he was only fifth behind the improving Willitgoahead at Thurles the last time; there's no obvious reason why he should reverse those placings.

üî¶ Spotlight: Eight wins over rules fences include two hunter chases last year; joined this yard for ¬£30,000 in October; suited by good ground but he was too free for his own good after a break when tailed off behind Bardenstown Lad at Fakenham; even should he give himself a greater chance here, his form credentials aren't that persuasive; cheekpieces return.
