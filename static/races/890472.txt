💬 Comment: Ran well under Elizabeth Gale two starts back; recent form a big plus in this race
🔦 Spotlight: One of few who can boast some solid recent form, with last month's second under Elizabeth Gale at Taunton (2m3f, good) a good effort; below that next time over 3m but was too free and didn't give herself a chance to stay; has a query at this trip too but she ran respectably on her only start in this headgear combination (2022) and has to enter calculations.

🔦 Spotlight: Scored at Tramore (2m, soft) in August 2023 but winless since and he's yet to get going in two runs for this yard, latterly beaten 25l at Stratford (about 2m6f, good) 12 days ago; cheekpieces (which he wore for his stable debut when beaten 22l) are tried again.

📝L2 Comment: always behind (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said he had no specific instructions from trainer other than to ride gelding as he found him and that he had jumped off in behind the leaders as gelding had shown a tendency to have a look at an obstacle in the past when in front and he therefore preferred to be in behind going into first hurdle; jockey further reported that he raced behind the bridle for most of race and that he had tried to hold gelding together as much as he could while consistently nudging him along throughout race, feeling that gelding was unsuited by the going as it was riding very dead and that having asked for an effort turning out of back straight on final circuit, he then held him together when turning into home straight down the hill in order to get him safely over the final obstacles and to get gelding to finish as best he could when he had no further to give on tiring ground, which was noted; vet had nothing to report)
