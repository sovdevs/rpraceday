🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1lb above his last winning mark and was successful the last time he raced at Class 3 level
🔦 Spotlight: All four wins over 1m2f on the AW including two here; may have needed the run after 84 days off at Lingfield (1m2f, Polytrack) 13 days ago, but still ran well to finish fourth of 12; just 1lb above his last winning mark and was successful the last time he raced at Class 3 level; big chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running well lately; lightly raced for a 4yo and may have an even bigger effort in him
🔦 Spotlight: Rnning well in defeat since needing his return from 15 months off in November, chasing home a nice sort at Newcastle (1m2f, Tapeta) in January and looking unlucky not to go closer when third of ten at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) last month (three of these behind); still lightly raced for a 4yo and may have an even bigger performance in him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner last autumn; market should be informative on reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark when winning an uncompetitive five-runner novice over C&D in October; sent off joint-favourite (alongside Penzance) for his handicap debut here the following month and was still in front when the race was voided; not seen since then but is proven fresh and the market should be informative.

🔦 Spotlight: Promising in first two starts on Polytrack last winter, including when chasing home Notable Speech at Kempton (1m) in January, but has only made the track twice since and not matched that form (✂️ gelded before latest start); longer trip should be within range on handicap debut, but he needs a resurgence.

🔦 Spotlight: All 12 runs for Doug Watson at Meydan, split equally between grass and dirt, winning twice on grass (1m/9.5f); makes his stable debut (same owner) after 13 months off and the market should guide.
