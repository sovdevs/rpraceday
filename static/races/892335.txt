🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Should go well provided he stays, being unraced beyond 2m5f
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win in 16 hurdle starts was in October 2023 but he arrives here in better form than most and has shown some consistency this season; should go well provided he stays, being unraced beyond 2m5f.
Horse quote: 2023-10-30 at Huntingdon (16f): "I love this horse, but he has had such bad luck. He ran his race before it started at Worcester as he bucked the jockey off twice then he was due to go to Fakenham, but that was abandoned then at Hereford he was withdrawn after he kicked Alex Edwards (jockey). Although he is called Jack The Savage he is anything but that as he is my hack at home every day and he is such a legend."

Horse quote: 2021-07-05 at Worcester (16f): "That was good. It didn't go to plan last time. We bought Kazontherazz as she's a half-sister to Back On The Lash. She's not the biggest but she'll stay further, she was going away to the line. She looked super today and she jumped great - Martin Keighley, trainer."
