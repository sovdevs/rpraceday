💬 Comment: Record of 4-5 (Flat/hurdles) for current yard and remains well treated on peak form
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 4-5 (Flat/hurdles) since joining current yard, most recently winning at Southwell (2m, AW) returned to this code; remains favourably treated on historical data and commands respect.
Horse quote: 2024-09-19 at Yarmouth (14f): "I bought Charging Thunder on spec and sold him about an hour before the race, so it's all gone well. He was a good horse back in his day and has slipped into the lowest grade he's run in for a while. We've schooled him and he's taken to that quite well. He was going to go hurdling next, but after today we might change our mind, although he'll see a hurdle at some point - trainer James Owen speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame in two novice hurdles this winter for 🆕 new yard; not seen on Flat since 2023 but is on last winning mark and has possibilities provided she turns up in top form; suited by 2m+.
Horse quote: 2023-07-28 at Ascot (16f): "Blazeon Five had a little bronc. I thought she was quite tired pulling up, but perhaps she could have gone around again. She had a little buck and dropped the shoulder on me, it's something you expect on a Monday morning but not here. It was a weird race pace-wise, essentially we had a target to run at entering the straight and he dropped away. Temporize took me to a point where I felt like I was going okay, but when he dropped away I was left in front with a bit to run and I had to commit. I think she was just waiting for him - Jack Mitchell, jockey."
