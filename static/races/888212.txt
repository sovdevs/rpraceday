🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner; unlucky not to finish closer than fourth over C&D last month; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Won good-ground Market Rasen bumper last spring and has made the frame on both hurdling starts; put in good front-running shift and ran better than finishing position suggests when fourth over C&D (good to soft) last month; tongue-tie added today; major player.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in Irish points last year and made the frame on both hurdle starts last month; ran to fair level when keeping-on fourth of 12 at Southwell (2m, good to soft) on latter occasion and has a big role to play here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not beaten far when fourth on debut but in a race that developed into a sprint
🔦 Spotlight: From family with which Pam Sly has done well; only beaten about 6l when 50-1 fourth on debut at Doncaster in January (2m, good to soft; winner ran well in valuable handicap on Saturday) but that race developed into a sprint and the form is treated with a degree of caution.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointed on hurdling debut but may yet deliver on point/bumper promise
🔦 Spotlight: Went close on Irish point debut in 2023 and was placed in soft-ground Carlisle bumper on rules debut in December; last month's hurdling debut at Taunton (2m, good to soft) was disappointing but it would be foolish to write him off after that.
