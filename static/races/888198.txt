🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: With a top stable but was unable to land a significant blow on debut
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to low-grade chase winner Smurfette; with a top stable but was unable to land any sort of blow when fifth at Warwick (2m, soft) last month and needs to have taken significant benefit from that outing.
