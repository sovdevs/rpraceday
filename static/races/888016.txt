🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inching up, first past the post on last 3 starts at 7f and 1m; latest 3lb rise is fair
🔦 Spotlight: Has been racing on left-handed tracks, first past the post on last three starts at 7f and about 1m, but he acted perfectly well here when a strong-finishing runner-up over 6f in October; up 3lb for beating a next-time winner at Wolverhampton last week; can progress further.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved handicap form when tight with Manton Road (1m; demoted) at Lingfield; competitive
🔦 Spotlight: Little of note in early handicaps but she did well at Lingfield (1m; first-time blinkers) last month, considering she made ground wide on the home bend, to make a fight of it with the demoted Manton Road (now 2lb worse off); should be very competitive.

🔦 Spotlight: Limited impact in AW events at 7f and 6f this winter; has been ✂️ gelded; goes handicapping off rock-bottom mark but pedigree leans towards sprint trips and first-time cheekpieces are another unknown.
