🔦 Spotlight: Best effort in four starts last year when a close third behind useful rivals in a Leopardstown maiden over 6.5f; that was on good ground but seemed to cope with soft on debut; one of the main players coming from this renowned yard.

💬 Comment: Best run when second at Navan; if ready on seasonal debut then should be a 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Solid debut over C&D behind a well-regarded filly and improved on that when runner-up at Navan, also over 6f; if ready enough on seasonal debut then should be a 🔥 big player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Consistent sort; if he handles the ground his racefitness will be an advantage
🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for in-form yard; consistent in defeat in five starts, four on AW; probably didn't stay 1m last time but not sure dropping to 6f on soft are his optimum conditions; still, if he handles the ground his racefitness will be an advantage.
