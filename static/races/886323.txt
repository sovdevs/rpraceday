🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close at Plumpton in December and has also been in good form on AW for new stable
🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced all six hurdling starts for Henrietta Knight but went very close at Plumpton (2m4f, good to soft) for Jim and Suzi Best in December and has also been in good form on the AW for his new stable in recent months; still on a lowly mark in this sphere and commands respect.

🔦 Spotlight: Largely disappointing over fences since last spring but was keeping on steadily and still had a chance before falling in home straight at Wincanton (3m1f, good to soft) in December; reverts to hurdling on a tempting mark and is worth a second look; cheekpieces (tried once in November) given another whirl.

🔦 Spotlight: Displayed promise in two 2m novice races here last spring and remains very 🔍 unexposed over hurdles but returned from break with poor Flat run in October and has been off for another 116 days since; tries a new trip on this handicap hurdle debut; others have more pressing claims.
