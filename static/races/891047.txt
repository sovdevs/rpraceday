💬 Comment: C&D winner; banging at the door this year and should run his race once again
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins in 2024, including C&D, and he comes here on the back of five good runs in defeat; no obvious reason why he wouldn't be in the thick of it once again.

🔦 Spotlight: Gained his seventh course win when scrambling home in an amateurs' event over C&D ten days ago; made a big move from 3f out to 1f out there though and he was entitled to get a bit tired close home; respected under a 4lb penalty.

💬 Comment: On a losing run but he was a promising 3rd tried in a visor last month; chance with repeat
🔦 Spotlight: Not easy to catch right but he's on a dangerous mark and ran a sound race when third over C&D six weeks ago despite running into traffic difficulties; it remains to be seen if the visor will work so well a second time but the ability is there if it does.
