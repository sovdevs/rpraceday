🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner bidding for a hat-trick; drawn wide but still respected in his current mood
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner just under a year ago and comes into this on a hat-trick after two wins at Southwell (1m, Tapeta), the latest a narrow success under Andrea Pinna 11 days ago; up another 2lb and although his wide draw isn't ideal, he has to be respected in his current mood.

🔦 Spotlight: Course winner (6f) who is usually seen at Newcastle these days; still 1lb lower than when winning there (1m, Tapeta) in November, but his form has been patchy in the meantime so not quite sure what to expect; cheekpieces return.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 9lb below last winning mark but will need to improve on recent efforts; blinkers on
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time winner over C&D including twice in the autumn; 9lb lower than for the most recent, but he will need to improve on recent efforts if he is to take advantage; first-time blinkers replace the usual visor.
Horse quote: 2021-05-10 at Lingfield (AW) (8f): "There was plenty of pace in the race so I bided my time out of the wind down the back straight and Mykonos St John came through at the end. Gelding has been the making of him - Saffie Osborne, jockey."
