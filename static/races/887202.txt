🔦 Spotlight: Promising effort in the second of two Irish points; dropped out into a very remote fourth of five finishers on hurdle debut here (2m6f, heavy) this month but it wouldn't surprise to see a better show here.

🔦 Spotlight: Close second in Irish point in March 2022; not seen again for two years but he put up a good show when runner-up on hurdle debut at Perth (2m4f, soft) last April; very disappointing when pulled up in May but his Perth form is strong in this context and coming here fresh is probably a good thing.
