🔦 Spotlight: Unable to justify strong market support when only fifth at Exeter (2m2f, good) this month and now 0-8 over hurdles; moves back up in trip and swaps cheekpieces for blinkers today; interesting to see whether her supporters wade in again.

🔦 Spotlight: Close third off mark 6lb higher than today's on seasonal debut at Sedgefield (2m4f, soft) in October but her subsequent three-race spell over fences was very disappointing and she was well beaten when back over hurdles last month; swaps cheekpieces for first-time blinkers and tries new trip here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well to a point in her latest qualifying race and has a lowly opening handicap mark
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten at huge odds in her three qualifying races towards the end of last year but, with a tongue-tie fitted, ran well to a point at Wincanton (2m4f, good to soft) on the most recent occasion; has a lowly mark for this handicap debut and is worth a second look; 1lb out of the weights.

💬 Comment: Pulled up in first three handicaps and very difficult to enthuse over
🔦 Spotlight: Showed nothing more than minor promise in her three qualifying races and was pulled up in her first three handicaps (2m4f-2m7f); very difficult to enthuse over; 1lb out of the weights.
