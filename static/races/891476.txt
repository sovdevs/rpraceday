🔦 Spotlight: Won Chelmsford novice (7f, AW) last September on third start and followed up in Newmarket nursery (7f, soft); reappeared with fair fifth at Newbury (7f, good) a fortnight ago and could show the benefit of that outing today; Newmarket trainer has a 26% strike-rate here; one to be interested in.

💬 Comment: Today's step back up in trip could suit and we may not have seen the best of her
🔦 Spotlight: Ran well on fast ground on first two 2yo outings (C&D on debut) and, after a slow start, was a 2l fifth of seven on nursery debut at Kempton (7f, AW) last November; today's extra yardage could well suit and we may not have seen the best of her (cost 150,000gns at the breeze-ups last April).

🔦 Spotlight: Won in fine style when making virtually all in Catterick maiden (7f, good to firm) last August on his third start; down the field in York nursery (7f, good to firm) later that month but he's not ruled out in a first-time hood in view of the promise he showed at Catterick.
