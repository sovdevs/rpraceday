💬 Comment: Dual French bumper winner and comfortably defied market weakness at Kempton
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a half-sister to the yard's top-class hurdler Epatante; won two bumpers in France (AW/very soft) and defied market weakness to make a successful British debut at Kempton (good; 2-1) where she was extending her lead at the finish; promising; entered in the Grade 2 Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham.

💬 Comment: Dual French bumper winner and comfortably defied market weakness at Kempton
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a half-sister to the yard's top-class hurdler Epatante; won two bumpers in France (AW/very soft) and defied market weakness to make a successful British debut at Kempton (good; 2-1) where she was extending her lead at the finish; promising; entered in the Grade 2 Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham.
