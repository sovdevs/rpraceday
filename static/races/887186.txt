🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts were early last year on her first two starts over hurdles, albeit falling at the last in the latter (on soft); what she's shown in three races since (2m4f handicaps on both this season) does not look good enough but this step back down in trip may well help.

🔦 Spotlight: 80-1, tongue tied first time and kept hanging right, sometimes badly, when tongue tied for handicap at Bangor (extended 2m3f, soft) on latest start and faded to be beaten about 14l in fifth of ten, but she does have some ability; goes right-handed this time and may be worth a second look.
