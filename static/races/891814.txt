🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Landed a Southwell nursery in November; may be more to come from him upped in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Hinted at ability in three AW novices over 7f last October and improved when just getting up to make a successful nursery debut at Southwell (1m, Tapeta) in November; off since and now 4lb higher, but he is stoutly bred on the dam's side so there may be more to come from him upped again in trip.

💬 Comment: Has regressed since her promising debut at Kempton in December; visor on
🔦 Spotlight: Bred to be useful but has regressed since her promising debut when third of eight at Kempton (1m, Polytrack) in December; finished last of seven (behind Crackalackin) on handicap debut at Southwell (1m4f, Tapeta) this month; needs the switch to a visor to bring about a resurgence.
