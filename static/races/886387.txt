💬 Comment: Ex-Irish; very little of note so far but well connected and represents up-and-coming yard
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish; tiny glimmer of ability on AW but nothing of note on turf, over hurdles or on a point start; has modest claims off his opening mark on those efforts but his dam bred some useful types and he goes handicapping for a yard that's a rising force; watch the market like a hawk.

💬 Comment: Two bumper wins; close 4th over 1m4f here in second handicap; non-stayer at 1m6f latest
🔦 Spotlight: Won two bumpers in 2023; has had few suitable chances on the Flat, seemingly finding his level when not beaten far in his second handicap, over 1m4f on this track, before failing to see out 1m6f at Wolverhampton since; should still have potential under Rossa Ryan.
