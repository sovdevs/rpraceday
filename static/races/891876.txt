🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-14 but in fair form in chases despite jumping lacking fluency; could be firmly involved
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who is 0-14 under rules; however, he's been a fair third over fences at Newcastle (2m4f/2m7f, good/good to soft) the last twice despite his jumping not being great, and he could be firmly involved if finding greater fluency now back over hurdles.

🔦 Spotlight: Stayed on well to win in a first-time tongue-tie (retained since) at Ayr (2m4f, soft) last month; only sixth at Catterick (2m3f, good to soft) a fortnight later but this lightly raced 6yo retains potential, especially now up in trip (half-brother to useful stayer Duke Of Deception).

💬 Comment: Fair fifth at Newcastle this month and open to improvement now up in trip; possible player
🔦 Spotlight: Returned from a break with a fair fifth at Newcastle (2m4f, good) this month on his second handicap start; this lightly raced half-brother to Scottish National winner Macdermott is open to improvement now up in trip and he's a possible player in first-time cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy win at Ffos Las last week; tackles new trip today but escapes a penalty for last time
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark in first-time cheekpieces (retained) at Ffos Las (2m4f, good) last Friday on her second stable start; she's unraced beyond that trip but drew clear to do it very easily last week and escapes a penalty, so will be very tough to beat if seeing out the distance.
