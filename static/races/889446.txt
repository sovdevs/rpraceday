🔦 Spotlight: A well-beaten outsider in three novice/maiden hurdles at around 2m this winter (good to soft-heavy) but came second in a good-ground Irish point last spring and is open to significant improvement under rules now she's hiked up in trip and back on a sound surface for her handicap debut.
