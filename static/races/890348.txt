🔦 Spotlight: Three wins last year and last two were on good to firm over C&D; didn't shine in final three runs last season but she's edged back down the weights and needs watching in market on her return; regular hood is removed.
Horse quote: 2024-06-03 at Brighton (8f): "Cieren [Fallon, jockey] gave Blenheim Star a sensible ride and she won with a fair bit in hand again. It's nice when they handle a track like Brighton as you're always happy to go back. Hopefully there's more improvement in her, I think she'd benefit for a step up to a mile and a quarter - William Knight, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Three 1m wins (good/good to firm) last summer but the handicapper looked in control in his final two runs last season; returns after 212 days off and has some work to do on his first run at this track.
Horse quote: 2024-05-15 at Bath (8f): "Sunny Corner went really wide on the bend but showed a bit of ability at Windsor. He just needs to settle down and learn to chill out a bit and I think he'd be quite a nice horse. He wouldn't want it too firm, though - Stuart Kittow, trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Triple winner, with first two on turf and latest on Polytrack at Lingfield last August; only 2lb higher than for that last success but he's lacked spark on AW this year and needs to raise his game back on turf.
Horse quote: 2024-08-14 at Salisbury (7f): "Kracking jumped well and travelled along really well. He was always doing enough and I never really felt any pressure from another horse. Mr [Stuart] Williams was confident so I just let him bowl along. I'm happy to be back with Mr Hannon doing what I love. I could do with an agent to keep the ball rolling into the winter and get a few more rides - Tyrese Cameron, jockey."
