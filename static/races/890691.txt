🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-2 over C&D and did well to dominate from stall 12 last time; 3lb rise manageable
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Irish 4yo who is 2-2 since dropped back to 6f by his 🆕 new yard, both victories achieved over C&D; he had been off for 170 days prior to his recent win and he did well to dominate from his wide stall on that occasion; might face competition for the lead this time and no banker to confirm the placings with Radiant Angel.

💬 Comment: One course run that offers hope of better; makes handicap debut at a low level
🔦 Spotlight: Left the impression he was capable of better when a never-dangerous fourth over 7f here on his third start; tailed off at Leicester since but he makes his handicap debut at a low level and the betting should guide.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D win in February but beaten into seventh back here last time; usually worth opposing
🔦 Spotlight: He had dropped a long way in the weights prior to leading late on in a C&D handicap in February; only seventh here last month and others are more persuasive for win purposes.
Horse quote: 2023-09-14 at Ffos Las (6f): "Heartrate drifted from 5-4 to 13-2 and we couldn't get our head around it as we thought he'd go well. I liked the look of him at the sales, he's a big, strong horse and has plenty of form, including on the all-weather. He was bought as a fun horse and we'll keep him going through the year. He looked good in what probably wasn't the strongest race for the grade - Mark Loughnane, trainer."
