🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off since December but was looking 📈 progressive back then; handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner who is 2-3 over hurdles and was nicely on top late on to defy a penalty at Hereford in December (2m3f, good to soft); that form has been franked and, while a three-month break is offputting, he's a 5yo who should have more to offer.
