🔦 Spotlight: Promising third at Ayr (6f, good) last October on second start and won at Redcar (6f, soft) later that month; in good hands and his useful pedigree suggests he has potential off his handicap debut mark; on the shortlist.

🔦 Spotlight: Promising third at Ayr (6f, good) last October on second start and won at Redcar (6f, soft) later that month; in good hands and his useful pedigree suggests he has potential off his handicap debut mark; on the shortlist.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't really threaten in nurseries but won over C&D previously and is not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't really threaten in her three nurseries last August-November but she made it 2-2 when winning by 4l over C&D (good) last July and perhaps a break and the return to this course will be the catalyst for a good run.
