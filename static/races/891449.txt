🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ballydoyle colt who made all at Naas on seasonal debut; leading chance on the figures
🔦 Spotlight: Seems versatile as regards ground; useful colt who made all for 2l success at Naas (1m) on seasonal debut, taking record to 2-6; likely to stay this new trip; seems well down the pecking order at Ballydoyle, and his trainer's underwhelming record in this contest features just one win (in 2019); however, holds a leading chance on form.
Horse quote: 2024-09-10 at Galway (8.5f): "Trinity College is very genuine but we thought the blinkers would make him travel better. He will stay very well and is a middle-distance horse for next year. We will see after the weekend where he fits in - Chris Armstrong, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Seemed to run very well in the Ballysax on second start; major player on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Twice-raced Irish colt who justified favouritism in Dundalk maiden (1m, AW) then appeared to run very well in the Ballysax at Leopardstown (1m2f, good to yielding); latter effort gives him major claims.
Horse quote: 2025-02-14 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Tiberius Thunder was greener than I thought he would be but he hit the line nice. He will improve plenty and he will stay further - Wayne Lordan, rider."

💬 Comment: 📈 progressive but chance depends on what the weather does; seems suited by soft/heavy
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive but his chance may depend on what the weather does, having gained his two wins on soft going then performed well in a heavy-ground Horris Hill; dam's side suggests he'll stay the new trip.
Horse quote: 2024-10-11 at York (7f): "That was a good performance and we've always liked Mirabeau. We thought he'd win first time at Newbury and he was the last off the bridle. He scoped badly afterwards and took a long time to come 100 per cent. He came on for his win at Brighton, he likes to get his toe in and he stays well. We'll probably put him away now and we hope he can make his mark in black type company next year - Dominic Ffench Davis, trainer."
