💬 Comment: Clearcut win at Wincanton and he still looks feasibly treated off revised mark; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Has a patchy record but he got back on the scoresheet when justifying favouritism at Wincanton (2m4f, good) last month; up 9lb but he ran right up to his best with that eased-down success and this return to forecast slower ground is no problem; key player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On dangerous mark on this step back up in trip but he needs to rediscover his spark
🔦 Spotlight: Usually comes from off the pace; won twice over fences (2m4f/2m3f) on good ground last spring but he's not made an impact since October, including after wind surgery in last two runs; now goes back up in trip but he needs to rediscover his spark.
Horse quote: 2024-05-23 at Market Rasen (19f): "God's Own Country has taken time to mature but he's really stepped forward since going chasing, 2-3 now and a little unlucky at Warwick last time. He's on an upward curve and hopefully he'll continue that way being well-suited by the better ground at this time of year. Tom Messenger, assistant trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in four of his last five starts including at Stratford latest; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Act on good and soft ground and seems versatile trip-wise; hurdle winner who is 0-6 over fences but he's finished runner-up in four of his last five runs including at Stratford (2m3f, good) last month; nudged up 2lb but he was clear of the third last time and he's respected.

💬 Comment: Didn't progress over hurdles and was a remote fifth on chase debut (3m, good) last month
🔦 Spotlight: Added to his point win when landing a maiden hurdle (2m4f, good to soft) last April but he didn't progress in that sphere and was a remote fifth on chase debut at Uttoxeter (3m, good) last month; mark continues to fall and this drop back in trip could suit but others are more persuasive.

🔦 Spotlight: Two hurdle wins (2m-2m1f) on slow ground for Olly Murphy in 2023, but she's not seen much action since and was pulled up in two runs (point/handicap chase) during the winter; still 🔍 unexposed in this sphere but she needs a major revival with cheekpieces added.
Horse quote: 2023-03-23 at Chepstow (16f): "Oakley Dancer is a nice, big mare who has taken time to come to herself. She's got a pedigree and is going to want two and a half miles next season. She's come forward with each run - Olly Murphy, trainer."
