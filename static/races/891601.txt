🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive at Catterick on return (well backed; had wind op over the winter); 2lb well in
🔦 Spotlight: He had undergone wind surgery prior to making a winning reappearance at Catterick nine days ago (well backed), always near the pace before running on strongly to win by daylight; 2lb well in under a penalty and conditions won't be a bother having won his maiden over C&D; obvious chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unpenalised for Monday's Ayr win (6f); ⬆️ up in class but comes here in top form
🔦 Spotlight: In good form on AW in March and he has carried the good work back on to turf, third over C&D last month before winning a 6f handicap at Ayr on Monday; unpenalised for that success but he is back ⬆️ up in class today.
Horse quote: 2021-05-02 at Sligo (6f): "Ramon Di Loria ran well at Dundalk. He is a good ground horse, Ronan gave him a lovely ride and I think he'll go forward from here - Tracey Collins, trainer."

💬 Comment: He's been saving his best for this track of late and ran well over 1m last month; solid
🔦 Spotlight: Last season's two wins both came at this track and he was back in top form when second over 1m here 19 days ago; used up some fuel getting to the front from a wide stall on that occasion and the effort can be marked up; one to consider from a better draw back down in trip.

💬 Comment: Improved on the Flat last year; hurdle career quickly shelved; contender for in-form yard
🔦 Spotlight: 6f win at Newmarket last summer and also ran well over 7f at Wolverhampton in November (off 2lb lower); sent to David Pipe for a hurdling career but that was quickly aborted after he pulled far too hard at Taunton in December; still has potential back on the Flat for a yard in good form.

Horse quote: 2021-05-17 at Carlisle (7f): "It was a taking performance by Pallas Lord as he's been on a massive learning curve from his first two runs. The stiff track and the soft ground have suited him - Harry Russell, jockey."
