💬 Comment: Every chance off this mark if returning in good order; conditions ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Admirably consistent in 1m2f-1m6f handicaps last year and heavy ground was no good to him on his final two appearances; handicapped to be very competitive if returning in good order.

💬 Comment: 0-8 but her run three starts back heightens interest and she's in a good yard
🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 and pretty much tailed off in her last two races at about 1m6f on the AW; however, she was second of ten in 1m5f good-ground handicap at Lingfield before those disappointments and cheekpieces (fitted for all those runs) are now off; one of the more interesting contenders given the yard she's from.

🔦 Spotlight: Very up and down under both codes but won a selling hurdle in April and gained a second AW success at Wolverhampton on Boxing Day (2m); would certainly have a squeak if running one of her better races.
