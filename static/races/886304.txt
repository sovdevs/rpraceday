💬 Comment: Hat-trick includes a 3m4f win; up another 6lb but he's going from strength to strength
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Carlisle (3m, soft) and Market Rasen (3m4f Lincolnshire National, good to soft) in December and a storming finish secured him the hat-trick when dropped back to 3m at Sandown (heavy) three weeks ago; up another 6lb and in race distance but he's going from strength to strength.

🔦 Spotlight: Won from the front in the Somerset National at Wincanton (3m3f, good to soft) latest outing and the way in which he emerged in second on the run-in for London National at Sandown (3m5f, soft) the time before suggests strongly that this test will suit; major player despite top weight.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this last year; major player if cutting out last time was because he needed the race
🔦 Spotlight: Final leg of a four-timer last season was this race, beating Prince Des Fichaux by a neck on heavy going after a bad blunder two out (4lb higher today); below form this term but there seemed to be encouragement on last two starts, looking a threat turning for home in the Edinburgh National three weeks ago; ended up beaten 23l that day but he's a major player this time if it can be relied upon that he needed that run and will now be cherry ripe.

🔦 Spotlight: The clear best from him last season was his second over the extended 3m5f at Fairyhouse (soft) in December and he found a bit extra to emerge the strongest in the same race (on yielding) this term, completing a double; sixth in top handicap at Christmas was a good effort considering the drop back to 3m at 33-1; ridden last three starts by claimer Harry Sexton; made fruitless visits to Britain for the 2022 Eider (unseated early) and Scottish National (pulled up) but his good days demand respect.

💬 Comment: Neck second in this race last year off 4lb higher but he's been below form this season
🔦 Spotlight: 2lb out of the handicap today but he was second in this race last year off 4lb higher, so nearly capitalising on Anglers Crag's bad mistake two out; below form this season and made mistakes himself when pulled up here behind some of today's rivals on latest outing.
