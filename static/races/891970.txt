🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has taken well to chasing after a long absence, easy task last time, Paul Townend rides
🔦 Spotlight: Smart novice hurdler two seasons ago; off for 21 months before jumping well to win a beginners' event from the front here on New Year's Day; led to two out when outsider of stable's three in Grade 1 at Leopardstown; not seriously challenged in landing the odds in a 2m Grade 3 event at Navan; Paul Townend's choice over Ile Atlantique.
Horse quote: 2025-03-01 at Navan (16f): "I was always going to keep it as simple as I could. Champ Kiely loves jumping fences. To be honest, I thought we built up nicely from leaving the back straight and every time he heard the other horse coming he pulled out loads. I was always in control - Paul Townend, jockey, speaking to Racing TV"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had race conditions in her favour when winning here in February, open to further progress
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; won a maiden hurdle at this venue last year before fine second to stablemate Jade De Grugy in a Grade 1 novice here; reappeared in December to make winning chasing debut in 2m5f Cork mares' beginners'; confirmed a high standard of form when taking advantage of a significant weight allowance in a 2m2f mares' Listed event here in February.
Horse quote: 2025-02-22 at Fairyhouse (22f): "For a mare with only one run over fences I thought it was a hell of a run in a Listed chase. We'll look at the WillowWarm Gold Cup, the Grade 1 for novices, here at Easter. Spindleberry seems to like this track. She's entered at Cheltenham but that might just come a bit soon after today - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat Firefox readily at Naas, flopped in the Arkle at Leopardstown, questions to answer
🔦 Spotlight: Limitations exposed at Grade 1 level during last season's novice hurdling campaign; much more like it on his first two starts over fences; backed up Navan beginners' win when readily accounting for Firefox in a 2m Grade 2 at Naas in January; very disappointing in Arkle at Leopardstown, labouring by halfway; questions to answer.
Horse quote: 2025-01-05 at Naas (16f): "Ile Atlantique is a lot stronger horse since last season, which is a big help. We can go 2m or 2m4f with him now, so we will look at the Dublin Racing Festival and decide which way we will go - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Creditable third in the Drinmore over C&D, soundly beaten by Ile Atlantique at Naas
🔦 Spotlight: Course maiden hurdle winner last season defeating Ballyburn; ran well in defeat in Grade 1 novice hurdles at all three major festivals; chase record features creditable third Drinmore over C&D, same placing in Leopardstown Arkle (2m1f); in between, no match for Ile Atlantique in 2m Naas Grade 2; needs to raise his game following sixth in the Jack Richards at Cheltenham.
Horse quote: 2024-11-01 at Down Royal (20f): "Firefox probably learned more today than in any novice chase with Henry's horse taking him on an jumping as well as him. Sam said he just gave him a squeeze coming down the hill and he picked up. I wouldn't be afraid of coming back in trip - Gordon Elliott, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No match for the subsequent Brown Advisory winner Lecky Watson at Punchestown in January
🔦 Spotlight: Made a good start over fences when landing a beginners' event at Navan in November; jumping let him down somewhat in a Grade 1 at Sandown in December; made a bad mistake at the last when no match for the subsequent Brown Advisory winner Lecky Watson at Punchestown in January.
Horse quote: 2024-11-16 at Navan (17f): "Down Memory Lane is a good horse and had a few small little problems last year. I thought it was a very good performance there today, he jumped great and galloped the whole way to the line - Gordon Elliot, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful mare, yet to win a chase and not in the same league as several of these rivals
🔦 Spotlight: Best of five attempts chasing when a clear second behind a hot favourite in 2m2f Exeter mares' Listed novices' in February; well held in fourth in Naas contest in which Ile Atlantique beat Firefox; fourth of five behind Spindleberry over 2m6f here 13 days after her Exeter run.
