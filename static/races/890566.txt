🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Her fifth at the Festival entitles her to every chance and this longer trip will suit
🔦 Spotlight: Only fifth behind Jubilee Alpha at Taunton in December but had that rival behind (and others in here) when fifth of 23 in the Grade 2 for mares here at the Festival; that form entitles her to every chance and this longer trip looks favourable.
Horse quote: 2024-12-09 at Lingfield (16f): "We've got a date in March in the back of our minds and when you have a really nice one like Metkayina you've got to dream big. She's definitely a Pattern horse. We've always held her in high regard. I've not had stacks of good horses, but I've had some nice mares and she's well above average. We'll look for some black type or even look at the Winter Million. I thought it looked like a hot race and it might have been easier to dodge it, but we wanted to take Diva Luna on. I don't think it'll be the last time they clash either - Noel Williams, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran below expectations here in March but now back at Listed level (penalised)
🔦 Spotlight: Eyecatching effort in a Listed race on hurdling debut and went on to win her next two, with Bluey and Metkayina among her victims; carried plenty of stable confidence in the Grade 2 for mares here in March but after momentarily threatening she faded away disappointingly; has a penalty back at Listed level and now has to prove that she doesn't need flat tracks; still much respected over a new trip she's bred to stay.
Horse quote: 2025-01-19 at Windsor (16f): "Jubilee Alpha will go straight to Cheltenham. She had a big weight and that ground doesn't really suit her, but it was an obvious race and I'm thrilled. She went to Newbury and then Taunton, so it was in the back of my mind that this came soon enough, but we've got a nice gap now to get her right. She had some good bumper form, and we found out how good she is at Newbury. I know I can get her better than she showed there. We've got a few nice chances at Cheltenham and she's definitely one of them - Paul Nicholls, trainer."

💬 Comment: Has form claims but faded rather tamely last time at Limerick, albeit in a Grade 3
🔦 Spotlight: Won a point on good ground but heavy has been in the description for both her hurdle wins (2m5f/2m3f); couldn't live with Supreme runner-up William Munny two runs back but a greater concern would be her rather tame finish at Limerick, albeit in a Grade 3; rain would be welcomed.
Horse quote: 2025-01-27 at Punchestown (19.5f): "The Great Nudie didn't like being covered up here the last day. Ground conditions really suited her today. She jumped and travelled well. She's not very big but she's hardy - Sean Flanagan, rider."

💬 Comment: She'll stay the trip okay but balance of form suggests she'll come up short
🔦 Spotlight: A front-runner who has won two minor races but was perhaps flattered to finish within 2l of Jubilee Alpha at Windsor in January and she was pulled up in a Grade 2 here at the Festival; she'll stay okay but may come up short.
Horse quote: 2025-02-18 at Market Rasen (16.5f): "Bluey is in at Cheltenham and after today I'm not going to rule that out at all. One of the reasons for coming here was to get her qualified for the Mares' EBF Final at Newbury; that's on the same day as the Herring Queen Series Final up at Kelso which she's also qualified for so we've got three nice options on the table. In fairness, the Herring Queen is 100,000GBP and that's a mares' novice handicap, the Cheltenham race is 105,000GBP and that's going to be more competitive and then you've got 55,000GBP at Newbury - Emma Lavelle, trainer."
