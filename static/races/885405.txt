🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second in Kim Muir at Cheltenham and third in Scottish National; 5lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Looks best on softer than good; second in the Kim Muir at Cheltenham last March and third in the 4m Scottish National next time; last of 12 in a hurdle race on reappearance four weeks ago, which he's likely to leave way behind him today but he needs overall improvement from 5lb out of the handicap.

💬 Comment: Others were stronger over 3m2f on return; usually shaped at about 3m as if she's a stayer
🔦 Spotlight: Her only attempt at a marathon distance saw her crack from two out in last year's NH Chase at Cheltenham (3m6f, heavy) and others also proved stronger late on over 3m2f at Kelso on reappearance; however, she's usually shaped at about 3m, including latest start, as if stamina is a strong suit; well worth another chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 12lb higher than Welsh National win, including 6lb out of handicap; notable 🚀 improver
🔦 Spotlight: Won three in a row last winter and successful this season when stepping up in trip at both Carlisle (3m2f, good to soft) and Chepstow (near 3m7f, soft); latter was the Welsh National in which he was always prominent and had enough in hand to beat the strong-finishing Jubilee Express; the big problem today is his 12lb higher mark, including 6lb out of the handicap, but there's lots to like about his stamina, attitude and improvement.

💬 Comment: Strong-finishing 2nd in Welsh National; 12lb higher, including 8lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Snatched a win over C&D on final start last term; co-favourite, close up entering the straight under Dylan Johnston for Welsh National at Chepstow (near 3m7f, again on soft) on reappearance but made serious inroads on Val Dancer only on run-in and had to settle for second; 12lb higher today, including 8lb out of the handicap, but that latest run was his fourth improved effort in a row and it looks as if none will see out the trip better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tremendous overall record at Haydock but he ran as if something amiss here on latest start
🔦 Spotlight: Tremendous 5-7 record at Haydock includes his wins in last two runnings of Grade 1 Betfair Chase; it was a shock therefore when he ran so poorly here four weeks ago, something surely amiss; needs to rebound from that and also needs to prove his stamina, having fallen in the 2023 Irish National on sole attempt at this sort of trip; best results on soft or heavy ground.

💬 Comment: Usually runs well here; will probably stay; first headgear might spark something extra
🔦 Spotlight: 2-4 at Haydock and firmly in contention when he unseated six out in this race last year, on his only attempt at this sort of trip; 2lb out of the handicap today but he stuck to his task when placed over about 3m2f on first two starts this season, so he'll probably stay, and the first-time headgear might spark something extra.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2lb lower than last season's peak show (3m5f, soft); 17l fifth of 17 in the Welsh National
🔦 Spotlight: Not at all discredited in the 3m2f Coral Gold Cup at Newbury in November and she managed fifth of 17 in the Welsh National, albeit 17l behind Val Dancer; neither of those matched her best show from last season when close second in the Classic at Warwick (3m5f, soft) but she is now 2lb lower than in that race, so is well treated on that evidence.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big challenge in Welsh National until he sprawled four out; might prefer soft or heavy
🔦 Spotlight: Much the strongest up the straight to win 3m3f Grand National Trial at Punchestown (heavy) by 16l one year ago; no comparable form since and sticky jumping has been a clear problem, but he was nevertheless launching a strong challenge (coming from a detached last) when sprawling badly four out in the Welsh National on penultimate start, pulled up soon after; 4lb out of the handicap and might prefer soft or heavy ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Mightily impressive with a wide-margin win at Wetherby (3m, soft) last winter and same again at Haydock (extended 3m1f, soft) in November this term; however, tailed-off favourite in this race in 2023 and in the Classic Chase at Warwick last term, with another major failure at this sort of trip in the Welsh National on latest outing, so there are very mixed messages.

💬 Comment: Won this race last year off 11lb lower; another big run on penultimate outing
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped well before winning this race last year in first-time cheekpieces (kept since) on heavy ground, but he does not need the mud; third of 18 in the Troytown at Navan (3m, yielding) in November was another big run, followed by a lesser show in the Thyestes at Gowran Park last month (24l fourth of 18); the chief worry is that he's 11lb higher than in this race last year.
