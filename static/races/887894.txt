🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third on both AW attempts, 76-rated filly makes plenty of appeal on stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in six of her ten races, including both at this venue; third over this this trip for this rider before another good effort when apprentice-ridden over the extended 1m2f last time; 76-rated colt makes plenty of appeal on first start for this stable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good run in third over 7f in November, appeared not to stay 1m4f two weeks later
🔦 Spotlight: 485,000gns yearling; probably unsuited by soft ground when unplaced odds-on favourite in a 7f maiden at Down Royal last September; adapted to this surface when third behind the odds-on Declaree over 7f in November; appeared not to stay 1m4f two weeks later; jockey has an excellent recent strike rate here, trainer going well also.

🔦 Spotlight: Showed little in three starts over 1m2f-1m4f for Jessica Harrington; half-brother to several AW winners at around this distance; duly improved when dropped to 7f for his recent Dundalk/stable debut, finishing third behind the two market principals; ran on well from the rear for an apprentice; Colin Keane takes over.

🔦 Spotlight: Twice placed last spring, including over this trip at Leopardstown on good ground; two subsequent turf handicap runs were disappointing; has left Natalia Lupini since finishing at the back on her first run at this venue ten weeks ago.

🔦 Spotlight: 485,000gns yearling; probably unsuited by soft ground when unplaced odds-on favourite in a 7f maiden at Down Royal last September; adapted to this surface when third behind the odds-on Declaree over 7f in November; appeared not to stay 1m4f two weeks later; jockey has an excellent recent strike rate here, trainer going well also.

🔦 Spotlight: Showed little in three starts over 1m2f-1m4f for Jessica Harrington; half-brother to several AW winners at around this distance; duly improved when dropped to 7f for his recent Dundalk/stable debut, finishing third behind the two market principals; ran on well from the rear for an apprentice; Colin Keane takes over.

🔦 Spotlight: 485,000gns yearling; probably unsuited by soft ground when unplaced odds-on favourite in a 7f maiden at Down Royal last September; adapted to this surface when third behind the odds-on Declaree over 7f in November; appeared not to stay 1m4f two weeks later; jockey has an excellent recent strike rate here, trainer going well also.
