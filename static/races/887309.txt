💬 Comment: Runner-up in Newcastle handicap on second start back from a long absence; one to consider
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in novice hurdles and he returned to form when runner-up in a Newcastle handicap (2m6f, soft) in January on his second start back from a long absence; could build on that last run and he's one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame last spring in first two handicaps (2m4f, good to soft/soft) and returned to form when third in first-time cheekpieces (retained) here (2m4f, soft) last month; there's stamina in his pedigree and today's step up in trip could eke out some improvement.

🔦 Spotlight: Tailed off at 40-1 on handicap debut here (2m4f, soft) last month but that was his first outing since last May; showed staying potential in 2m-2m4f novice hurdles last spring and this 3m point runner-up could be a big 🚀 improver on this second start back from a break.
