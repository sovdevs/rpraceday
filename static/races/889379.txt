💬 Comment: Bumper and novice hurdle winner who is in excellent hands to continue her progress
🔦 Spotlight: Good-ground bumper winner who has been favourite for all three hurdle starts, finishing second twice in a row (2m/2m4f, soft/good to soft) before winning in a big field at Warwick (2m5f, soft); in excellent hands to continue her progress and she's very much respected on handicap debut.

💬 Comment: 2m novice hurdle winner who is open to improvement now up in trip on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Exeter (2m, soft) in December on second hurdle start and has run creditably in third on both outings since (2m, soft); begins handicap life on a fair mark and this 3m point runner-up (good to yielding) is 🚀 open to further improvement now up in trip; firmly in calculations.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins in the summer of 2023, two of them on the Flat and one on hurdle debut; following a long absence he's run pretty well in defeat this winter in his first two handicap hurdles (2m/1m7f, good to soft) and having won over 1m6f on the Flat he could be suited by today's step up in trip.

💬 Comment: Fair sixth of 17 here last time and today's forecast better ground may well be a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced 9yo who returned to some form with sixth of 17 here (2m3f, soft) last month; needs another step back in the right direction today but the forecast better ground may well be a plus (his bumper and maiden hurdle wins came on good to soft going).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10yo who has very healthy strike-rate but returns from a break and may prefer further
🔦 Spotlight: Enhanced his very healthy strike-rate with win at Bangor in October; however, pulled up at Warwick in November and off since; this 10yo's last seven wins have all come over 2m7f+; others make greater appeal.
