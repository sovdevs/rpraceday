🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had some very useful form on the Flat; 2nd in both hurdle runs; contender on h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-Sir Mark Prescott; only Flat win was a 1m3f maiden but she showed some very useful form, notably when third in a Sandown Listed event over 2m (good); bought for 100,000gns in October; has finished second in both starts over hurdles, latest a 2m3f Warwick mares' novice (good to soft; cheekpieces tried and retained); obvious contender on handicap debut.
