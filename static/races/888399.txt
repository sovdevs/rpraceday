💬 Comment: Made all over C&D last month; 3lb higher and drawn wider, but still respected
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who made all when winning over C&D last month; 3lb rise fair enough and although he has a bit more to do if he is to repeat the same tactics from his high draw, his presence still gives Robert Cowell a strong hand in this race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner, but has finished fifth in her last four starts on the AW; needs a bit more
🔦 Spotlight: Handy sort who won over C&D as a 2yo; last five wins have come on turf, the latest from 4lb higher at Yarmouth (5f, good) in September, but she has finished fifth in all four AW starts since then so needs a bit more to get back on the scoresheet.
