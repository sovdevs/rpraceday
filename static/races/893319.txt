💬 Comment: Grade 3-placed over fences but not at his best last three starts; experienced type though
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 3-placed over fences but a record of only 1-15; not at his best last three starts; an experienced type though and would have a chance if back to form.
Horse quote: 2022-05-02 at Down Royal (16.5f): "Gaelic Arc is a funny horse, difficult to train, and a horse you wouldn't have a punt on. He's going to be a lovely horse over a fence. The ground today probably suited him and was the key today. Niall Prendergast gave him a cracking ride and he'll go over fences now - John Ryan, trainer."
