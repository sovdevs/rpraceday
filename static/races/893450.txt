🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point' second joined top team for 62,000GBP; obvious appeal
🔦 Spotlight: Sister to bumper/hurdle/chase winner Itchy Feet, half-sister to two French chase winners; second in a point at Loughanmore for Ger Quinn last October before fetching 62,000GBP at Cheltenham; missed engagement in Fairyhouse Listed bumper early this month due to quicker ground so has to be respected here in a likely weaker race on softer ground.
