🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won three of his last four starts; major chance despite 8lb rise and wide draw
🔦 Spotlight: Comes into this in red-hot form winning three of his last four starts, the latest of which was at Lingfield (7f, Polytrack) on Wednesday; up another 8lb including his penalty and stall 11 not ideal, but he won that last race with a good deal in hand and the return to this trip is no problem.
