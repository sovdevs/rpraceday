💬 Comment: Solid debut for his 🆕 new yard a fortnight ago (AW); holds leading claims upped 2lb
🔦 Spotlight: Solid debut for his 🆕 new yard, having been picked up for 48,000gns last backend and ✂️ gelded, a fortnight ago (AW); won over a straight 1m last summer on his second start back from a break and,  upped 2lb, there's a good chance that history repeats itself.

🔦 Spotlight: String of solid efforts in Tapeta handicaps this year and he doesn't appear to do anything wrong; has been nudged up another 2lb, though, and will need to find a bit more for the switch from cheekpieces to blinkers, and from the AW to turf.

💬 Comment: Won first time out this time last year and went on to win both starts over C&D; considered
🔦 Spotlight: Won first time out this time last year, which is a bonus back from seven months off, and went on to win both starts over C&D; higher in the weights now but her yard has been in decent nick and she's considered.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Yarmouth (8f): "Royal Velvet has won really well there today. I did think the flat track and the easy mile really suits her and she likes that ground. She was quite backward last year and she's just really coming to herself. I think she could be quite useful - William Knight, trainer, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won four handicaps last year, including today's race off 5lb lower; better can be expected
🔦 Spotlight: Won four handicaps last season, including today's race off a 5lb lower mark; will need to improve somewhat on his Redcar comeback, but returns to the usual blinkers from cheekpieces today and better can be expected.
Horse quote: 2024-06-13 at Nottingham (8.5f): "We'll check Great Blasket over tomorrow but as long as he comes out of the race okay I can't think why he wouldn't take his chance. He's a very hardy horse. He won first time for us and we probably didn't know how to ride him the next few times on the all-weather. Kieran Shoemark won on him at Southwell, where we said we'd drop him out and try to get there as late as possible, and since then he's won four from five. The change of tactics has definitely worked in his favour. I think stepping up to higher grade races suits him down to the ground, a harder pace and better quality of horses gives him a better target to aim at - Jamie Insole, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: This race is a bit stronger, upped 4lb after four months off, but he may be up to the job
🔦 Spotlight: Useful 3yo who found his level again late last year when winning a couple of Wolverhampton handicaps; this race is a bit stronger, and he's upped 4lb back from four months off, but he may be up to the job.
Horse quote: 2024-11-04 at Wolverhampton (AW) (8.5f): "Bass Player retains plenty of ability but has his quirks. We had sweetened him up a little and my daughter Lauren rode him in some amateur races. I'm hopeful there could be a bit more to come - he has the ability to travel well through a race which does help on the all-weather - Kevin Frost, trainer."
