🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close at Wetherby on Boxing Day and had excuses when disappointing favourite since
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner who bettered her low-key hurdling debut when keeping on well to go close at Wetherby (2m3f, good to soft) on Boxing Day and had a valid excuse when a disappointing favourite on her next outing (bled from the nose); needs to prove herself on good ground but can play a leading role if back on song.

🔦 Spotlight: Absent since below-par 2m4f run at Perth in September, but was placed in four consecutive maiden/novice hurdles over that C&D (good-soft) last spring/summer and will be in the thick of things if somewhere her best.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed over 2m at Doncaster this month and ought to be suited by this return to 2m4f
🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise in Irish points in the autumn and has made the frame on both hurdling starts this year, most recently when third at Doncaster (2m, good) 17 days ago; has a bit to find on the figures but the move back up in trip ought to suit and she probably still has potential.
