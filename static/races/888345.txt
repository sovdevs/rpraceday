🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stable has a good record in this and he was close up on his recent hunter chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent in recent years but has always been talented and the horse who beat him on his hunter chase debut at Ludlow (3m, good to soft) has run well since in defeat (behind Bardenstown Lad who was well held last week at Cheltenham); Paul Nicholls has won three of the last six runnings of this race.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Heavy ground an excuse on comeback; big shout on last year's spring form
🔦 Spotlight: Won two hunter chases (one at Cheltenham) last spring and heavy ground wouldn't have suited when pulled up on his return from 270 days off at Leicester last month; he was only 14-1 for the hunter chase at Aintree last April when again unsuited by a testing surface; if back to his peak form from last spring he would hold every chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hunter chase winner; has done well in points and beat a respected rival in the latest
🔦 Spotlight: Modest handicapper for Oliver Sherwood but he romped home in a three-runner Fakenham maiden hunter chase last May and has done well in points either side of that; beat a respected rival in the latest 12 days ago and should run well.
