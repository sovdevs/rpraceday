🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner and form working out; half-brother to The Kalooki Kid; big run likely
🔦 Spotlight: Involved in a point when coming down late and gained compensation with Dromahane point win in November; second and third have both won points since; half-brother to useful 2m1f-2m4f hurdle/chase winner The Kalooki Kid so no surprise if he ran a big race on debut for these connections.
