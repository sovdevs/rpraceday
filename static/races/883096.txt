🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten just once; odd mistake when winning Irish Arkle; that's the strongest piece of form
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 5yo, beaten just once; won Triumph Hurdle (2m1f, heavy) at last year's Festival; 2-2 over fences, making the odd novicey jump but convincingly on top from before last fence when beating Touch Me Not by 9l in Grade 1 Irish Arkle at Leopardstown (2m1f, yielding) last month; races prominently; has the strongest piece of form and is 🚀 open to further improvement.

💬 Comment: 4-4 over fences; reliable and tactically versatile; may not have reached his ceiling yet
🔦 Spotlight: Useful hurdler (runner-up in County 12 months ago); has made into a significantly better chaser this season, jumping notably fluently when scoring over C&D (good ground) in the autumn; followed up in Grade 1 Henry VIII at Sandown (from Touch Me Not) and maintained 100% record over fences in Grade 2 Kingmaker at Warwick (2m, soft) 31 days ago; reliable and tactically versatile; a high-class novice who may not have reached his ceiling just yet.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won here in December and edged out at Sandown; interesting dropping from 2m4f to 2m
🔦 Spotlight: Upwardly mobile type, first or second in all eight races; ended last season's hurdle campaign with eyecatching second in hot handicap at Aintree and has taken very well to fences this term, jumping soundly when winning here (good to soft) in December and when edged out in Grade 1 Scilly Isles at Sandown (heavy); those runs were over 2m4f but he's a strikingly strong traveller who should prove at least as effective back at 2m; major player for yard that has won this race with the likes of Sprinter Sacre and Altior.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up to L'Eau du Sud and Majborough this winter; others more likely for win purposes
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner; didn't set the world alight over hurdles but he's already a much better chaser; won Grade 2 novice at Punchestown (2m, soft) in November and has finished second in Grade 1s at Sandown (soft; beaten under 4l by L'Eau du Sud) and Leopardstown (yielding; beaten 9l by Majborough) since; in the mix but others are more likely for win purposes.
