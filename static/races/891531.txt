🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten under a length at Yarmouth on Tuesday; should take all the beating from same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Little in three starts over 6f/7f on the AW last month, but took a big step forward when beaten less than a length into second of 12 on handicap/turf debut at Yarmouth (1m, good; first-time cheekpieces) on Tuesday; should take all the beating from the same mark.

💬 Comment: Beaten a head on return/handicap debut at Southwell last time; one of the likelier winners
🔦 Spotlight: Showed nothing in three starts on turf last year, but beaten only a head (clear of the third) on her reappearance/handicap debut at Southwell (1m, AW; 66-1) 19 days ago; form nothing special and up 4lb, but still one of the likelier winners if as effective back on grass.

💬 Comment: Off the mark over 1m2f at Redcar last time; should be fine over 1m on this stiffer track
🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in his first eight starts, albeit not without showing some ability, before narrowly making it ninth-time lucky at Redcar (1m2f, good) this month; should be fine back over 1m on this stiffer track and is only 2lb higher, so has to be high on the list.

🔦 Spotlight: Second of 11 on nursery debut at Beverley (7f, good to firm; 50-1) for the Fell/Murray stable last August and she could be given a chance on that, but her efforts either side were modest; makes her stable debut (same owner) after seven months off.
