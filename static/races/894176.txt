💬 Comment: Triple C&D winner who had a near-miss at Lingfield last time and is only 1lb higher here
🔦 Spotlight: All three wins have been over C&D and last two were in January; has been a bit up and down since his last win but he hit a personal best with his near-miss at Lingfield last time and is only 1lb higher back at this track; interesting contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recorded his ninth win when scoring over C&D last month; 🔥 big player again up 3lb
🔦 Spotlight: Nine wins and 21 placed efforts from his 65 starts and latest success was over C&D last month; up 3lb but he remains feasibly treated and should be in the thick of things again.

Horse quote: 2024-11-21 at Wolverhampton (AW) (7f): "Harbour Vision knows his way round here better than all of us! He jumped well enough but there was plenty of pace and he really settled for me.
