💬 Comment: 📈 progressive form sent handicapping over 2m5f, 3m then 2m4f this season
🔦 Spotlight: Won handicap debut at Warwick (2m5f) in October; progressed again when second since at Aintree (3m) and Newbury (2m4f) and while all those improved efforts were on good or good to soft, he won bumpers in the mud and was placed in it over hurdles; considered.

🔦 Spotlight: One of the top staying novices of the 2022-23 season, getting the better of Stay Away Fay on last two starts and that rival took the Grade 1 Cheltenham novice in between; however, missed last season ("with a knock") and has been off for 680 days, so there might be a question over his readiness despite the Cheltenham Grade 1 Stayers' entry; market should give clues.

🔦 Spotlight: Usually claimer ridden; the last of her ten wins was in August 2022; still shows plenty on occasions, including when seventh in the Pertemps Final last March and a close second back at Cheltenham (2m4f) on penultimate outing; she performed far worse in the Musselburgh qualifier three weeks ago than she did last year, however, which sees cheekpieces enlisted.

🔦 Spotlight: Irish maiden point winner (3m, soft) who took a maiden at Southwell (2m4f, soft) last March on first attempt over hurdles; however, heavy defeat when 4-7 in novice at Ludlow (2m5f, good) in October was a lacklustre start to this campaign and his handicap debut over C&D (18-1, only time in a hood) at Christmas was a good deal worse; early days admittedly.
