🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won quite cosily over C&D in December and is now 3-4 in cross-country chases; good chance
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful handicapper over regulation fences and 3-4 since switched to cross-country chasing, winning twice over about 3m on the banks course at Punchestown before keeping on strongly to beat Mister Coffey and others in this field quite cosily over C&D (soft; also suited by good) in December; 8lb higher now but the cheekpieces are an interesting addition today and he commands respect.

💬 Comment: Second in this race in 2023 and now 1lb lower than when placed in 2024 Grand National
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 1 chase winner in his prime; not getting any younger and absent since close second in US Grade 1 hurdle in October but came second in non-handicap version of this race in 2023 (soft) and is now 1lb lower than when placed in last season's Grand National; drying ground will probably aid his cause; claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On the downgrade now and never really looked dangerous here on cross-country debut
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful handicap chaser in his prime (placed in Ultima here two years ago) but on the downgrade now; never really looked dangerous when seventh behind Stumptown over C&D on cross-country debut in December and was remote when fifth to Vanillier at Punchestown last month; 1lb wrong; needs to turn a corner.

🔦 Spotlight: Returned to form with third in Munster National at Limerick (3m, good) in October but quickly back in the doldrums since, the last twice in cross-country chases won by Stumptown (C&D) and Vanillier (Punchestown); might be boosted by refitted cheekpieces but others look much safer.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced since Welsh Grand National success in 2021 but a commendable third in this season's edition of that race (3m6f, soft) in December and again ran very well at Haydock (3m1f, soft) in January; drying ground will reduce his appeal but he has possibilities if he enjoys this new test.

💬 Comment: Belied 80-1 odds when fourth over C&D in December but is no longer the force of old
🔦 Spotlight: Bounced back from poor seasonal debut and belied 80-1 odds when fourth in C&D contest (soft; good to soft also suits) won by Stumptown in December, having raced prominently throughout; also ran well in a conventional chase last month but competes from 4lb out of the weights today and is not the force of old; refitted cheekpieces replace blinkers.

💬 Comment: Form nosedived after 2023 Munster National success; revival needed
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in the Plate here (2m4f, soft) two years ago and in Irish Grand National (3m5f, soft) a few weeks later but his form nosedived after Munster National success at Limerick (3m, soft) later in 2023; well beaten on last month's cross-country debut at Punchestown (race won by Vanillier) and arrives here with a lot to prove.
