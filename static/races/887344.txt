üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Won quite cosily over C&D in December and is now 3-4 in cross-country chases; good chance
üî¶ Spotlight: Very useful handicapper over regulation fences and 3-4 since switched to cross-country chasing, winning twice over about 3m on the banks course at Punchestown before keeping on strongly to beat Mister Coffey and others in this field quite cosily over C&D (soft; also suited by good) in December; 8lb higher now but the cheekpieces are an interesting addition today and he commands respect.

üî¶ Spotlight: Former pointer/hunter chaser who scored over C&D (soft) last season and was placed over C&D on both his other cross-country starts; led briefly on run-in when third behind Stumptown and Mister Coffey here (soft) in December and will be fine on today's forecast faster ground; big role to play.

üí¨ Comment: Won Punchestown festival handicap last spring but out of form since returning from a break
üî¶ Spotlight: Career highlight when narrow winner of Listed handicap chase at Punchestown festival (3m, soft) last May but out of form since returning in October from a break; big leap of faith required to support him on this cross-country chase debut; tried blinkers last time; usual cheekpieces back on today.

üî¶ Spotlight: Won 2022 Kim Muir here (3m2f, soft) and produced career-best performance when scoring by 13l over the big Aintree fences last season (3m2f, heavy); badly out of form this term, though, and this new discipline needs to rekindle his enthusiasm; 6lb out of the handicap.
