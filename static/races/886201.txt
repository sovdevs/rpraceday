🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point win reads well and they went no pace when she scored narrowly at Ludlow
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £130,000 after beating a subsequent Listed hurdle winner in her Irish point; didn't blow them away when justifying favouritism at Ludlow (beat a stablemate of Belle Le Grand) but they went no pace and she's probably better than the bare form.

💬 Comment: 8l off the winner of a bumper confined to newcomers at Wincanton; showed promise
🔦 Spotlight: Kept on quite promisingly to be 8l off the winner of a bumper confined to newcomers at Wincanton (good); tongue-tie also applied then and was ridden by Megan Bevan; a formline through the runner-up gives her something to find with Jackie Hobbs, though not a lot.
