🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won fillies' Listed race in January and could still have more to offer over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Won Flat maiden in Ireland in September and has taken very well to hurdling for new stable, despite a tendency to race too freely; justified favouritism in fillies' Listed race at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) in January and could have more to offer if subsequent wind op has made a difference.

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful Flat racer who beat Maple to open his hurdling account here (1m7f, soft) in January and has since been placed in a Listed race over that trip here (good to soft); likely to make his presence felt.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved form when second at Kelso this month; may progress again in handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: Placed on the Flat in France last summer; safely held over 1m7f here on first two hurdling starts but his recent Kelso second (2m, good to soft) was more encouraging and further progress is possible in handicaps.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up on three of his six hurdling starts, perhaps most notably when beaten by a nose at Catterick (1m7f, soft) two runs ago; not at best when last in action, though, and others in this line-up may have more potential.
