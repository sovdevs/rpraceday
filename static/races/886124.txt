🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won his maiden without much fuss and brings plenty of potential into handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: The form of his near-miss in a soft-ground 2m4f novice at Leicester in December 2022 is strong and he returned from an absence to win a 2m4f maiden at Hexham (soft) two months ago with the minimum of fuss; brings plenty of potential into handicaps.

🏇 Jockey: Sean Quinlan (Rank: 3.0)
🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed as he won well after a wind operation and he's bred for this step up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: He was struggling to replicate his bumper form over hurdles but that changed after a wind operation when coming clear from off the pace in a 1m7f soft-ground handicap here ten days ago; 6lb rise is fair and he might well improve again for this longer trip as there's stamina in his pedigree.

💬 Comment: Lightly raced in-form contender but career best is needed to defy his current mark
🔦 Spotlight: Has had only 12 races and won well enough at Sedgefield (2m1f, soft) to earn a 7lb rise; went close off his new mark there over 2m4f (good to soft) but has gone up another 4lb and they claimed 5lb last time as well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Responded well for early pressure to go close over C&D 19 days ago; up 2lb
🔦 Spotlight: Finished strongly to go close over C&D 19 days ago (after two chase runs) but he made hard work of throwing down a challenge, needing plenty of encouragement to get going; clearly capable of another big run (off 2lb higher) should he be able to hold his position mid-race.

🔦 Spotlight: He was struggling to replicate his bumper form over hurdles but that changed after a wind operation when coming clear from off the pace in a 1m7f soft-ground handicap here ten days ago; 6lb rise is fair and he might well improve again for this longer trip as there's stamina in his pedigree.

💬 Comment: Responded well for early pressure to go close over C&D 19 days ago; up 2lb
🔦 Spotlight: Finished strongly to go close over C&D 19 days ago (after two chase runs) but he made hard work of throwing down a challenge, needing plenty of encouragement to get going; clearly capable of another big run (off 2lb higher) should he be able to hold his position mid-race.

🔦 Spotlight: He was struggling to replicate his bumper form over hurdles but that changed after a wind operation when coming clear from off the pace in a 1m7f soft-ground handicap here ten days ago; 6lb rise is fair and he might well improve again for this longer trip as there's stamina in his pedigree.

🔦 Spotlight: Has had only 12 races and won well enough at Sedgefield (2m1f, soft) to earn a 7lb rise; went close off his new mark there over 2m4f (good to soft) but has gone up another 4lb and they claimed 5lb last time as well.

🔦 Spotlight: He was struggling to replicate his bumper form over hurdles but that changed after a wind operation when coming clear from off the pace in a 1m7f soft-ground handicap here ten days ago; 6lb rise is fair and he might well improve again for this longer trip as there's stamina in his pedigree.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced in-form contender but career best is needed to defy his current mark
🔦 Spotlight: Has had only 12 races and won well enough at Sedgefield (2m1f, soft) to earn a 7lb rise; went close off his new mark there over 2m4f (good to soft) but has gone up another 4lb and they claimed 5lb last time as well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won his maiden without much fuss and brings plenty of potential into handicaps
🔦 Spotlight: The form of his near-miss in a soft-ground 2m4f novice at Leicester in December 2022 is strong and he returned from an absence to win a 2m4f maiden at Hexham (soft) two months ago with the minimum of fuss; brings plenty of potential into handicaps.
