💬 Comment: Very good second at Newcastle latest; merits serious consideration off the same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Galvanised by blinkers, getting off the mark at Sedgefield (2m4f) in February and following it up with a very good second in 2m4f handicap at Newcastle the following month; winner has gone in since and merits serious consideration off an unchanged mark.
Horse quote: 2025-02-05 at Sedgefield (20f): "The first-time blinkers certainly sharpened up Rioja Alta, who ran a good, honest race - Micky Hammond, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Without a victory since early 2023 but he comes here in good order, ridden too aggressively when a fading sixth in 2m4f Hexham handicap 25 days ago; considered with cheekpieces refitted.
Horse quote: 2019-04-26 at Kilbeggan (16f): "Coral Blue worked well during the week so we were quietly confident. He was getting all the concessions. We'll see what the handicapper does and there's no reason why he can't go back on the Flat - Seamus Fahey, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-08-24 at Cartmel (25.5f): "The wind op has been a big factor. The ground being a little bit softer and no weight on City Derby's back has helped. Lizzie's done a fantastic job.
