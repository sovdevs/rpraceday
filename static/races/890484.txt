💬 Comment: Close second on hurdling debut over C&D last month and this looks a golden opportunity
🔦 Spotlight: 70,000euros 2yo and half-brother to a useful winning jumper in France; down the field in two bumpers during the winter but he started his hurdling career with a close second over C&D (good) last month; that was a promising effort and this looks a golden opportunity in this weak race.

🔦 Spotlight: Fair form with his two Flat wins (1m2f) in Ireland last year but he was tailed off in both hurdle runs for 🆕 new yard in December; has plenty to prove after a break and his stablemate Twist Of Fatecatch is the standout contender in this line-up.
Horse quote: 2024-05-07 at Navan (10f): "Master Dunraven was good today. We rode him quiet and it paid off as he came through them well. I needed a gap when I got it but to be fair, he did hit the line well - Ben Coen, rider."
