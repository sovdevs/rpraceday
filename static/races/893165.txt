🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came good with an emphatic staying display in the Albert Bartlett, sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Won last year's Champion Bumper at Cheltenham; unplaced favourite for Grade 1 at this fixture; suffered reverses in 2m4f/2m6f Grade 1s after 2m maiden hurdle win at Navan; went to Cheltenham with a question mark over the quality of his jumping; came good with an emphatic staying display in the Albert Bartlett; jumped well apart from untidy three out; sets the standard.
Horse quote: 2025-03-14 at Cheltenham (24f): "We have done a lot of schooling with Jasmin De Vaux as he is just so unnatural jumping. We know he has an engine, it is just about getting him from A to B. Going that bit slower over a trip has made a difference. He might even jump fences better than hurdles and he will probably go novice chasing next season. Most of those Champion Bumper winners turn out to be stayers. He had the pedigree and class so we felt it was worth going for this longer trip. Once he got over the second-last I said it was his to lose now, but then again, with one hurdle left, and with one of the worst jumpers in racing, I said he would probably do that (meet it untidily).I thought for a second once he landed over the last that he had thrown it away, but he did enough - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has come a long way in a short time, excellent 2m4f Aintree display, should stay this far
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a point last November and on hurdles debut at Naas in January; has made sustained progress since, winning over 2m at Navan and Leopardstown before taking the rise in class in his stride when winning a 2m4f event at Aintree; that was not the strongest of races for a Grade 1, but he overtook three horses from the last and may improve again over this trip.
Horse quote: 2025-04-05 at Aintree (20f): "Honesty Policy is very well named - he's as honest as the day is long. It's only his fourth run over hurdles and he's still inexperienced, and, in fairness to him, when he got going after the third-last he never raised his head off the ground and galloped all the way to the line. I was hopeful going to the last - he jumped and picked up well, but he wasn't going as quickly after the last as I'd have liked, but I knew he had enough left in the tank. He'll have no problem going over fences last year - Mark Walsh, rider."

💬 Comment: Front-running win over an extended 2m6f at Navan revealed him as a promising staying type
🔦 Spotlight: Second in sole point-to-point for Pat Doyle last autumn; fell early on his rules' debut in a Naas maiden hurdle; made amends by winning in fine style over 2m3f at Punchestown at this venue in February; backed that up with a front-running win over an extended 2m6f at Navan; promising staying type; Honesty Policy looks like the stable's main hope.
Horse quote: 2025-02-20 at Punchestown (19f): "Cardcounter is a nice horse. He was unlucky to fall early the last day. He's loved that ground and trip. He got a little bit outpaced turning in and we didn't go that quick, but he did it nicely in the end. He's a fine, big horse and I'd say he'll have no problem jumping a fence - Sam Ewing, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Takes a big rise in class, not guaranteed to stay as well as several of these rivals
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner last season; odds-on for all three hurdle wins, readily made all over 2m in November; did not have much to beat in races at Catterick and Haydock; takes a big rise in class and not guaranteed to stay as effectively as several of these rivals.
Horse quote: 2025-01-22 at Catterick (19.5f): "Jarrive De Mee was jumping right from the first hurdle, and then he missed the last five, but he's usually quite a slick jumper and maybe he'll just be better going the other way round ? it was a good performance considering what he gave away - Patrick Mullins, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tailed off in Albert Bartlett, no threat from three out at Aintree, up against it
🔦 Spotlight: 1-5 over hurdles; twice a beaten favourite before a wide-margin C&D maiden win on heavy ground; tailed off in Albert Bartlett at Cheltenham and no threat from three out in the Sefton at Aintree; ran to a useful level when clear second to subsequent Albert Bartlett runner-up The Big Westerner here last November; first-time cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2025-02-03 at Punchestown (23.5f): "Argento Boy felt much better today through the race. The further they went the better he felt. Ideally, he is a 3m chaser - David Casey, assistant trainer"
