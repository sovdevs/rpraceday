💬 Comment: 600,000euros buy; 4-9 favourite, quickened to win C&D maiden by 8.5l on debut last month
🔦 Spotlight: 600,000euros yearling; 4-9 favourite, quickened to win C&D maiden by 8.5l on debut last month; same connections' Notable Speech made a successful debut in that maiden before winning this, and later the 2,000 Guineas, last year (their Highland Avenue won the same maiden and this race in 2021; they also won the maiden with subsequent top-level winner Measured Time); this is a deeper race, but he has obvious potential.
