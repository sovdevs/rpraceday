🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't build on promising 2yo debut; potential remains but Moore prefers Butterfly Wings
🔦 Spotlight: Half-sister to five winners including the outstanding City Of Troy; dam won the Fillies' Mile and is a sister to Oaks winner Forever Together; promising Leopardstown debut in October over 7f but didn't step forward as anticipated at Dundalk 11 days later, fading quite tamely after a positive ride; potential remains but not sure if this trip is what she wants at this relatively early stage and Moore prefers Butterfly Wings.

💬 Comment: Outsider of the Ballydoyle trio and probably best watched with the future in mind
🔦 Spotlight: Wootton Bassett filly is first foal of a 9.5f winner (including Listed; RPR 111), herself a sister to Irish 2,000 Guineas winner Roderic O'Connor; debutante appears the outsider of the Ballydoyle trio and probably best watched with the future in mind.
