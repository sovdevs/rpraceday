🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Will again need the breaks from an outside stall but is surely up to winning off this mark
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't had much luck since dropped to this trip in 0-50 classified events lately, again finding traffic last time; is usually dropped in (can pull hard) and will again need the breaks from an outside stall, but is surely up to winning off this mark.
