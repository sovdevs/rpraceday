üî¶ Spotlight: Placed in a soft-ground Irish point in March 2023 but showed only a glimmer of promise on hurdle debut the following June and, following a long absence, was pulled up twice here in the autumn; makes chase/handicap debut after another break and from 4lb out of the weights; had wind op in January; considered only if lively in the betting.
