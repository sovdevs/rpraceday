💬 Comment: Became very disappointing over hurdles for Paul Nicholls; now chasing for new stable
🔦 Spotlight: Went close in Newton Abbot novice hurdle (2m5f, good) for Paul Nicholls last summer but quickly became very disappointing for him; drying ground might aid his cause on today's stable/chase debut but he has a lot more to prove than some of these.
