🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Clearcut win at Brighton ten days ago; should take well to Epsom; highly respected
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on ground softer than good; registered a clearcut win under Warren Fentiman at Brighton (1m) returned to turf ten days ago, taking record in this sphere to 3-12; should take well to Epsom; highly respected.
Horse quote: 2024-08-14 at Salisbury (7f): "Kracking jumped well and travelled along really well. He was always doing enough and I never really felt any pressure from another horse. Mr [Stuart] Williams was confident so I just let him bowl along. I'm happy to be back with Mr Hannon doing what I love. I could do with an agent to keep the ball rolling into the winter and get a few more rides - Tyrese Cameron, jockey."

💬 Comment: The only C&D winner in the field; interesting, assuming he retains ability aged nine
🔦 Spotlight: The only C&D winner in this field and gained that success on penultimate appearance (last September); fairly interesting back at Epsom, assuming he retains the same level of ability aged nine.
Horse quote: 2023-06-28 at Carlisle (8f): "Mostawaa has turned a corner in his old age. He won at Brighton two starts ago and then he went to York and toughed it out. I got a very easy lead that day and things fell right whereas today there was plenty of pace on paper, so you just never know. He stuck to it well on soft ground and I think we can investigate going up to ten furlongs now. Between the three and the two I didn't get much of a breather into him and we were going a good gallop. Myself and Pierre were kind of taking each other on but to be fair they both fought on well - Hollie Doyle, jockey."

Horse quote: 2023-09-23 at Ayr (8f): "I didn't really plan to be that far back, but I couldn't have gone much quicker. Revich clearly thrives on this track and this is his type of ground. He's a little terrier when he's under pressure and I got a really nice lead into it from Jason (Hart, jockey Titan Rock) and he took me to the winning line. I suppose they raced up the inside yesterday and it might be a bit chopped up on that rail. It's drying ground, it's fine - Hollie Doyle, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Should in theory be well suited by Epsom but two attempts have resulted in defeats; may be of greater interest when back at Brighton, having gained all seven turf wins there.
Horse quote: 2024-08-07 at Brighton (8f): "Uncle Dick is an absolute legend. He's won for all my apprentices either this year or last and just loves it at Brighton, he's just a different horse there. He'll have to go again on Thursday. If I don't run him in that there's not another race he can run in at Brighton this year so we might as well give it a go. He's such a good horse to have and the Brighton Mile is an amazing race to win. He's usually winning 2,500GBP races so it's nice to win one worth four times more - Eve Johnson Houghton, trainer."
