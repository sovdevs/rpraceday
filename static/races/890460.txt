🔦 Spotlight: Not far behind the top two here last month and probably ran to a similar level when a front-running third at the track two weeks ago (good); now 0-9 over hurdles (four Flat wins) but can't be discounted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest front-running third here seems a fair reflection of where he is right now
🔦 Spotlight: Not far behind the top two here last month and probably ran to a similar level when a front-running third at the track two weeks ago (good); now 0-9 over hurdles (four Flat wins) but can't be discounted.
