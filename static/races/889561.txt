🔦 Spotlight: Had an excellent 2024, winning Sandringham Handicap at Royal Ascot and Group 3 event at Deauville, both over 1m; down the field at the Breeders' Cup when last seen in November; probably needed the run on her only previous AW start; she's the pick on ratings and the one to beat.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Group 2 winner as 2yo; down in grade but stamina a doubt on first outing beyond 5f
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo, US-trained when winning Group 2 Queen Mary as a 2yo and stakes event at Gulfstream Park last May; came up well short in Group 1 contest at last year's Royal Ascot; drops in class here but has stamina to prove after an absence on first outing beyond 5f.

🔦 Spotlight: Improved markedly in three outings last season, making all in 1m Cork maiden on third of them by a wide margin (runner-up went one better next time); bred to be smart (out of a half-sister to Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck) and looks a very interesting contender in this higher grade.
