🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won for a ninth time here courtesy of a late rally (having led) on Monday
🔦 Spotlight: Won for a ninth time here courtesy of a late rally (having led) on Monday, for which he is penalised; that was over 1m5f but he's fine at this trip and some of his rivals have a lot to prove.
Horse quote: 2020-06-22 at Ayr (8f): "I've won on Glasses Up a few times. We thought the mile might be short for him but he's proved us wrong. They went a good gallop and he picked up well - Paddy Mathers, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Should be very well handicapped but recent efforts have been none too encouraging
🔦 Spotlight: Dangerously handicapped as he won off 12lb higher at York only last September; however, recent efforts have been none too encouraging (cheekpieces back on last time).
Horse quote: 2024-07-19 at Haydock (8f): "Young Fire a nice old horse and he seems to like the track. To get a winner for David (O'Meara) is quite good - Jack Doughty, jockey."
