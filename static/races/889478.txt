🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First two stable runs were promising; didn't fire last time but still looks worth chancing
🔦 Spotlight: Irish bumper winner (good to yielding) who subsequently collected three hurdle wins in France (all on heavy); started off for Harry Derham with two promising runs this year, the latter a third of 14 at Taunton (2m, soft); needs to rebound from a lesser effort at Newbury (2m4f) last month but might still be worth chancing.
