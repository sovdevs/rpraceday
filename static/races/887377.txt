🔦 Spotlight: Having his first run in a 7f handicap when finishing fourth here in December; better form at 1m subsequently, picking up nicely to win at Wolverhampton and doing well to get as close as he did there since when drawn highest and hampered; strong traveller who can have a good cut back at 7f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good record for H Turner but below best on last 2 starts and 7f is on the sharp side
🔦 Spotlight: Normally reliable and he's won and gone close in two attempts under Hayley Turner; however he wasn't at his best either side of a short break and his best form is at 1m so the rare 7f run raises questions.
