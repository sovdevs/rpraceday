🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: It looked a stronger race in which he was third on handicap debut at Ayr; player
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 5yo who won his maiden at Hexham (2m4f, good to soft) and ran well to be third having been well backed for a Class 3 3m novices' handicap at Ayr's recent National meeting; seemed to see out the trip fine but won't mind returning to 2m4f.

🔦 Spotlight: Form figures of 3111 in handicaps since joining Olly Murphy on ground ranging from good to soft to heavy; defied a nine-month absence at Leicester in December and that form has worked out well; up another 7lb and drying ground is an unknown, but dangerous to dismiss.

🔦 Spotlight: Won a maiden hurdle here on good ground and again appreciated that surface when making all in a Newcastle novice last time (2m4f); splitting those performances was a run at Cheltenham (highly tried) and a second behind the smart Wendigo; doesn't look overburdened for this handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No closer than about 11l in his three handicaps and conditions are a grey area
🔦 Spotlight: All eight career runs have been on soft or heavy ground, the win coming in a 2m1f novice at Carlisle; no closer than about 11l in his three handicaps and conditions are a grey area.
Horse quote: 2024-10-17 at Carlisle (17f): "I Wish You was beaten by three of our horses. I never felt he was ungenuine or anything, he just wants further and to mature a bit. He was recommended and wasn't expensive, and the owners have been very good to us. We bought him as a two-year-old and it's very rewarding when you've kept them that long and they come through. I feel like there's a lot of progress in him and I think he's a chaser - Peter Scudamore, trainer's assistant."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won races in Ireland but not overly competitive in four chases for current yard
🔦 Spotlight: Won two hurdles and a novice chase in Ireland but hasn't been overly competitive in four chases for current yard; looks best watched for now.
Horse quote: 2021-11-28 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Gua Du Large was really disappointing at Down Royal. It was really heavy and I think he struggled on the ground, I think. We didn't really know what happened to be honest and he couldn't even finish. We put a tongue-tie on him today and that might have made a huge difference but I'd say ground and it being his first run, caught him out the last day. We said we'd have another go here and he got all the breaks and everything went right for him - Henry de Bromhead, trainer"
