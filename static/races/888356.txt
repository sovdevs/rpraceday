🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improving chaser, convincing 3m2f winner latest (heavy); different ground here
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced but going the right way over fences and was a convincing winner at Fontwell (3m2f, heavy) last month; has different going to deal with here, and he missed two good-ground hurdles last April, but of interest off 4lb higher than last time if the surface is thought suitable.

💬 Comment: Down weights; slow to find form since absence but better latest and now down in grade
🔦 Spotlight: Well treated these days and although he's run only four times since back from an absence, and his latest win, he ran better when runner-up at Wincanton (3m1f, soft; first-time visor, retained) last month; likely to fare better now back on good ground in this lower grade.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive winner of 2 of 4 chases; could be dangerous if getting an easy lead
🔦 Spotlight: Made all to win two of four chases (3m; good to soft and heavy) but he couldn't get an easy lead at Hereford in February where a bad mistake five out sealed his fate; left on the same mark, 8lb above his latest win, but he could prove up to the task if the race falls favourably.

💬 Comment: Won chase debut at 2m4f; wouldn't want rain and still to prove as good at 3m as shorter
🔦 Spotlight: Successful chase debut at Ludlow (2m4f, good) in October; handles slower surfaces but they aren't a help and 3m1f on soft was definitely pushing it at Hereford latest; needs to prove as good at 3m as over shorter.
