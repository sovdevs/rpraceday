💬 Comment: Improved in handicaps and when 7l sixth of seven at 40-1 in the St Leger at Doncaster
🔦 Spotlight: Hooded on last five starts; fourth of 16 in the Melrose Handicap at York (1m6f, good to firm) on penultimate start, meeting interference but staying on well from off the pace, and he improved on that form when 7l sixth of seven at 40-1 in the St Leger at Doncaster on final outing; ✂️ gelded since; up another 5lb but seriously 📈 progressive.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handicap hat-trick included Glorious Goodwood; bold show is on its way after Listed return
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a handicap hat-trick last summer, the final leg coming from the front over 1m6f at Glorious Goodwood (good to firm); ✂️ gelded in December and returned better than ever when close third of four in Listed race at Nottingham (1m6f, good) ten days ago; a bold show looks on its way.
Horse quote: 2024-08-03 at Goodwood (14f): "Jason Hart galloped Align The Stars in July last year before he'd ever run and said he'll win the Ascot Gold Cup, and we're still bang on track.   He still hasn't really raced over a relentless mile and six furlongs and I think an emphasis on stamina in the St Leger is really going to take him to the next level. It will take another step up for him to be competitive, but I have enough faith in him that it's a realistic aim.  I think back to Subjectivist at the same part of his career and he went to the Leger and it was too sharp a test for him, but then he won a Group 1 in the Prix Royal Oak as a three-year-old - Charlie Johnston, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won handicap first time out in 2023 and 2024; solid record last year but stamina to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Won a handicap first time out in 2023 and 2024; mostly solid efforts in defeat in Listed and Group 3 races later last year over about 1m4f; probably needs a career best and the latest of his three attempts (well beaten in them all) over this far was in July 2023.
Horse quote: 2024-05-11 at Lingfield (11.5f): "Aimeric is a fun handicapper. He's going up in the ratings, so they could have a crack at something else, but he is what he is. The quicker the better for him. I had to ride him slightly differently, he prefers to not get there too early but they can get away from you down the hill here. He's always had ability, he just needs proper summer ground - James Doyle, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Latest Flat win was this race in 2023 off 5lb lower; a very mixed Flat campaign last year
🔦 Spotlight: Peak Flat efforts on good to soft and his latest win in this sphere was this race in 2023 off 5lb lower; off 318 days before a very mixed Flat campaign last year but he had two wins and two seconds from his four runs over hurdles this winter; off two months but needs a second look.
Horse quote: 2021-04-21 at Catterick (12f): "Wise Eagle broke on terms but they went so quick that I just left him to it. He easily got into it in the back straight and won with plenty in hand. He has plenty of ability but they went so quick they set it up for him - Billy Garritty, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Better than ever Flat/hurdles last year; off 133 days before a hurdle race last Saturday
🔦 Spotlight: 8yo who was better than ever on Flat and over hurdles last year, including when second in the Ebor at York and winning at Ayr next time (4lb higher today); off 133 days before a hot race over hurdles (16-1) last Saturday, sprawling badly at the fourth flight; probably needs to resume improvement.
Horse quote: 2024-08-24 at York (14f): "Kihavah is a great horse and does brilliant things for our yard. Hopefully he's around for a long time. He ran a blinder but if you could predict the future and were a few pounds lower and were able to get in, that'd been an ideal scenario. The winner won well though, and we ran a brilliant race and are delighted. The mile and six stretches his stamina and that's as far as he wants to be going - Adrian Keatley, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: A mostly reliable sort at 1m4f-1m6f, ideally suited by softer than good; competitive mark
🔦 Spotlight: Can race freely and has been hooded except on last three outings last term, running well in those only on penultimate start (wore today's cheekpieces on last four); reliable sort otherwise over 1m4f-1m6f, ideally suited by softer than good, and he has a competitive mark; tongue-tie (worn twice in 2023) returns; stable is among the winners.
Horse quote: 2022-07-05 at Pontefract (10f): "Chillingham made a pleasing start and I knew he'd improve with racing. It was a case of whether the favourite was going to be very tough to beat. I hope the handicapper won't take it too literally. There was a shortage of mile-and-a-quarter maidens for this type of horse in the north of England. Our hand was kind of forced to come here, otherwise we were waiting until Leicester on the 16th, which wouldn't have suited us - Ed Bethell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Last season was disappointing on the whole and his last win was in May 2023; that suggests he's not the percentage call, but he's too well handicapped to be totally dismissed.

🔦 Spotlight: Best form came over about 1m4f on turf last summer, with two wins (York and Chepstow) and three close seconds, the latest at York Ebor meeting (2lb higher today) when he once again finished with gusto; 1m5f in the mud did not work out on final start and he was never dangerous in a warm AW race three weeks ago, but this trip is interesting.

💬 Comment: Fifth in this race in 2023 and his first-time-out record leaves something to be desired
🔦 Spotlight: Usually front-runner but some slow starts have been interfering with that; fifth in this race in 2023 and his first-time-out record leaves something to be desired; second in last year's Chester Cup in May (2lb lower today) and best known for his exploits at that track, where July 2023 saw his last win; perhaps best watched this time.
Horse quote: 2024-05-10 at Chester (18.5f): "Emiyn ran a cracking race. Turning in he was travelling well and he was probably looking for a gap. He likes it round here and we'll see what there is for him back here - Declan Carroll, trainer."

💬 Comment: Absent 1373 days when well beaten for 🆕 new yard three weeks ago; now tries cheekpieces.
🔦 Spotlight: Thrown in judged on his best form for Sir Michael Stoute but that was over 1m4f in 2020 when usually visored; absent for 1373 days (joined current yard for 27,000gns one year ago) and no headgear when fading right out of it at 40-1 in 1m2f handicap at Doncaster three weeks ago; now tries cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2020-09-04 at Ascot (12f): "I wasn't tied down on Laafy and thought they went plenty quick enough; I thought they'd come back to us. He loves soft ground and has won over a mile-six, but he's effective over over a mile and a half. He's a smashing horse, a big horse and that was a lot of weight in that ground - Jim Crowley, rider"
