🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shade disappointing over 7f last time but has twice made the frame over C&D this year
🔦 Spotlight: Ought to have been suited by the drop back to 7f when only sixth here four weeks ago but has twice made the frame over C&D in this grade this year and has pretty good each-way claims.
