🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3m entry at Cheltenham; impressed in winning a Wexford bumper and Carlisle maiden
🔦 Spotlight: A winning pointer and holds the 3m novice entry at Cheltenham; however, he's not looked short of speed in winning a Wexford bumper (soft) and following up in a 2m4f maiden at Carlisle (good to soft), by 6l and 12l respectively; looking useful.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All was going well until failing to fire in a Grade 2 latest; seems held in high regard
🔦 Spotlight: Has won a point and two novice hurdles on either side of chasing home the smart Celtic Dino at Ascot; highly tried in a Grade 2 at Cheltenham in January and couldn't have given his true running in finishing tailed off; highly regarded and much respected.
