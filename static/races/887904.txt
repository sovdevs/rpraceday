💬 Comment: Scored on belated return/yard bow; 6lb higher; 🔥 big player in hat-trick bid; cheekpieces on
🔦 Spotlight: Won his final start in Britain in 2023 and followed up on his belated return to action at Limerick on yard debut; 6lb higher but looks like a 🔥 big player in his hat-trick bid with that form working out nicely; first-time cheekpieces on.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fell 4 out when fav latest after chasing home Apologise on penultimate start; respected
🔦 Spotlight: It was too early to know what would have happened when falling four out at Limerick last month (sent off favourite); big effort when beaten half a length by Apologise on his penultimate outing and that form is working out nicely; should go well with a clear round.

🔦 Spotlight: Narrowly denied twice when switched to handicap hurdles last season and back on track in recent starts, finishing third of 13 at Limerick in first-time cheekpieces (retained) in December; might have finished closer without a late mistake and one to consider from the same mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Minor promise last season and came on from his seasonal reappearance at Limerick when third (beaten 8l) at Fairyhouse last month; not sure to appreciate the drop in trip on handicap debut though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Narrowly denied twice last season and back to form with Limerick 3rd latest; same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Narrowly denied twice when switched to handicap hurdles last season and back on track in recent starts, finishing third of 13 at Limerick in first-time cheekpieces (retained) in December; might have finished closer without a late mistake and one to consider from the same mark.
