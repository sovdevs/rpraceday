🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced; came from rear to win at Wolverhampton on stable debut; 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Thrice-raced 3yo; half-sister to several winners for Ralph Beckett and she made an immediate impact for the same yard (previously trained by Tom Ward) when coming from the rear to win maiden at Wolverhampton (5f) three weeks ago; should be at least as effective at 6f, so as long as she handles the new surface on turf debut she'll be a danger to all.

💬 Comment: Fourth in 2yo Listed event; improvement required now handicapping but that's possible
🔦 Spotlight: Had four runs as a 2yo, all over 6f, winning Goodwood novice (good to soft) and running well when fourth in Newmarket Listed event (good); hardly looks thrown in for her handicap debut but she's low-mileage and probably capable of better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready win at Ayr last autumn; still has untapped potential and might be the answer
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped well several times before putting everything together to score at Ayr (7f, good; first-time tongue-strap) last autumn and she's probably best forgiven a below-par run on soft ground at the Arc meeting just two weeks later; still has untapped potential back in a handicap; might be the answer.
Horse quote: 2024-09-20 at Ayr (7f): "Beronia definitely got stronger as she's gone on, her form is quite good from her earlier starts and I really liked her when I rode her in her first couple of races. She's benefited from 7f and being ridden slightly differently and she got the job done well. The tongue tie helped. She's definitely got a lot of ability - Billy Loughnane, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in maiden/novice company (6f) in second half of 2024 before coming up short in York Listed event last October; still looked 🔍 unexposed but she pulled hard and faded in another Listed race at Lingfield (7f) on return; requires a personal best but returning to sprinting may help.

💬 Comment: Won at Carlisle last June and placed off higher marks afterwards; now returns for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Kept busy last year when trained by Iain Jardine, winning at Carlisle (7f, soft) in June and placed off higher marks three times afterwards (all at 6f); still looks handily treated on her return from nearly seven months off, so it all depends on how she reacts to a change of stable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won 2yo maiden for George Boughey; bit disappointing next time and needs to hit a new high
🔦 Spotlight: Best effort for George Boughey as a 2yo when winning maiden at Pontefract (6f, good to soft) in the autumn; didn't repeat the form in nursery over the same C&D and she was subsequently sold for 40,000gns; needs to hit a new high on her first outing for Mark Rimell.

🔦 Spotlight: Only 2lb higher than when scoring at Pontefract (6f, good to firm) last summer but three subsequent runs were well below par; has no great record after a break so probably best watched on reappearance.

🔦 Spotlight: Had a productive 2yo campaign, winning three times including at Kempton (7f nursery) in November; might have been over the top when last of nine there the following month but she'll need another chunk of improvement if she's to make a successful return.
