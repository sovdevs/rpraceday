🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Expensive to follow over hurdles/fences but still a strong contender tried in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: 0-13 and he has been beaten at 5-2 or shorter in seven of his last eight starts; placed in all three chase runs this winter and he's high on the list in an uncompetitive event with cheekpieces now added.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up in four chase runs since October; latest conqueror was well treated; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice in points and he got off the mark under rules when making a winning chase debut at Exeter 11 months ago; runner-up in four chase runs since October and he was unfortunate to bump into one well ahead of his mark at Lingfield 26 days ago (travelled strongly); questions can be asked of his attitude given his dose of seconditis but he's still an obvious contender in this field.
