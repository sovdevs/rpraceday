🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Capitalised on odds-on favourite's fall to win at Newcastle; further improvement is needed
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark over hurdles at the fourth attempt at Newcastle (2m1f, good to soft) last month, capitalising on the odds-on favourite's fall three out; his pedigree provides hope he'll stay this far and his yard continues in excellent form, but further improvement is needed to defy a 7lb penalty.
