🔦 Spotlight: Second to a bang-in-form rival (went in again at Plumpton the other day) on his handicap debut and then responded well for pressure to win a maiden (2m3f, soft); 12lb higher than for the handicap defeat but probably progressing.

💬 Comment: 4lb higher than for his Newcastle defeat but remains in form and not dismissed
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m4f/2m handicaps on his return to hurdling and ran another sound race in a Class 3 at Newcastle, for all that he went there having escaped a penalty; now 4lb higher but still not dismissed.
Horse quote: 2023-11-09 at Sedgefield (17f): "Thank You Blue jumped really well. He'll probably be better over a little bit further, I was just forcing him for the last half a mile. He was good over the last two and galloped to the line - Sean Quinlan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Ayr maiden winner (2m4f, good to soft) and even better form when second there in a handicap over 3m; presumably something amiss next time with him now returning from a long absence; market could be informative.

Horse quote: 2023-10-24 at Exeter (18.5f): "We knew Woldspear was fit and well but he'd had so long [493 days] off the track and some of these horses take time to get going again. He ran well and was full of running at the end. I was pleased so hopefully he can come on for it and win more races - Oliver Boyden, rider."

💬 Comment: Has won over fences/hurdles but hasn't been running well over the larger obstacles of late
🔦 Spotlight: Has won over fences and hurdles but hasn't been running well over the larger obstacles of late; plenty to prove now.
Horse quote: 2023-11-18 at Wetherby (15f): "Findthetime didn't behave himself at all at Sedgefield, he made a right fool of himself, so we thought we'd go again fairly quickly. He's got a special sort of earplugs in and they've done something to him, they've put him to sleep a little bit. He's always shown ability, he's won three hurdles. I think Nells Son needs a good break between races, to get him fresh. A lot of two-mile horses need to have a bit of bounce in them. I wouldn't give up on him, I still think there's a good handicap in him. He'll have a proper break and we'll get him back - Nicky Richards, trainer."
