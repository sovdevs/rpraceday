💬 Comment: Bumper/dual hurdle winner but below par latest and may be one for handicaps later
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper (Tapeta)/dual hurdle winner who's been turned over at short prices a few times and was below par when last of three back from a break at Ludlow a month ago; may be one for handicaps down the line.
Horse quote: 2024-06-08 at Bangor-on-Dee (16.5f): "Not Now Nathaniel is not a bad mare. I couldn't get her settled in the mares' bumper at Aintree and I genuinely believe she would've been in the first four if she had. She's overeager and raw and just needs racing. She has a good engine - Brian Hughes, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
