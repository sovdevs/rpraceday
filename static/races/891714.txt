💬 Comment: Interesting off a workable mark returned to Class 3, being 3-3 in this grade over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Had wind surgery prior to latest run; has inconsistent form this term but looks interesting off a workable mark dropped back to Class 3, being 3-3 in this grade over fences.
Horse quote: 2024-02-15 at Sandown (15.5f): "Etalon pulled a muscle right at the start of the season, so we just gave him a bit of time and he's come good. He was always going to improve for a fence and you can ride him any way and on most ground. Now we've given him that time he's very straightforward. We ran him in the EBF Final last season and while he did stay two and a half miles he's more of a two miler and will stay at that for now. I should think we'll go to Aintree for the Grade 1 race [Maghull Novices' Chase] -"

💬 Comment: Made a successful return to fences when last seen; 4-7 for current yard
🔦 Spotlight: Record of 4-7 for current yard includes three wins over hurdles; made a successful return to fences in Plumpton event when last seen five months ago and may improve further.
Horse quote: 2024-10-07 at Stratford (16.5f): "Vocito has been a durable little horse and his owners have been with me a long time, so it's great. I thought there were horses in there with potential and he was having to give them so much weight, but he had a softish lead up front and that bit of experience counted for a lot - Olly Murphy, trainer."

Horse quote: 2022-10-28 at Wetherby (16f): "Parisencore was consistent last season and deserved to win his two races. He relaxes well in front and pops away well. I don't think he can go up too much for that so hopefully there's a bit more to come - Nicky Richards, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Has lost his consistency this season but ran well (finished just under 2l second) at Kelso most recently and is difficult to dismiss on the back of that effort.
Horse quote: 2024-02-24 at Newcastle (16.5f): "Netywell is amazing. Heavy ground has made the difference to him. It doesn't matter if it's a good race or a bad race, he just copes with the ground really well. He seems to be improving as well and that was a quick turnaround. He'll keep going while the ground stays right - Lucinda Russell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Veteran who is a long way out of the weights; opposed
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who has lost his form since Class 5 win last July and is a long way out of the weights in this grade; readily opposed.
Horse quote: 2018-07-06 at Newton Abbot (21f): "Sword Of Fate had to come here after his Stratford win the other night as it was the last time he would have been off his old mark as he is due to go up 6lb. He has now had two runs in four days so he will have a little break and be back in three weeks or so - Tom Lacey, trainer."
