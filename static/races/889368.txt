🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up over C&D in December and probably similar form when running well on two visits to Fakenham; pulled up at Sandown but that was in the competitive EBF Final and perhaps found the ground too soft.

🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to the stable's Cheltenham hero The New Lion; pulled up in his only point and modest form when a 13l third on hurdling debut at Hereford (2m3f, good); has to improve, though that's perfectly feasible.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won only one of his 20 Flat starts, a 1m4f classified race on the AW 13 months ago
🔦 Spotlight: Won only one of his 20 Flat starts, a 1m4f classified race on the AW 13 months ago; ran moderately at that same level when last seen; had wind surgery ahead of this hurdling debut but makes very limited appeal.
