💬 Comment: Won on h'cap debut when last seen in 2023, just 1lb higher now, ✂️ gelded, watch the market
🔦 Spotlight: Is 1-4 on turf; off the mark on handicap debut in a nursery at Galway (7f, heavy) in October 2023; just 1lb higher now, has been ✂️ gelded and rain a plus but entitled to need this after a mammoth layoff; watch unless strong in the market.
Horse quote: 2023-10-30 at Galway (7f): "I've Been Dreaming did it well. He's a big raw horse and he surprised me how well he handled the track. He could be one to look forward to next year - Mark Fahey, trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Won seven for Ger Lyons (four on turf) and was rated in the 90s in his pomp; has yet to get his head in front since joining this yard but he ran a decent race on latest when not beaten far at Leopardstown (7f, good); rain is a big concern, however.

💬 Comment: C&D winner off 10lb higher last May; out of form on AW, can't be discounted; blinkered
🔦 Spotlight: Seven time AW winner is 1-12 on turf, his win coming over C&D off 69 last May; raced exclusively at Dundalk for current yard and has yet to hit top form but mark has tumbled and is now 10lb lower than last turf success; can't discount in first-time blinkers.

🔦 Spotlight: One of two for yard; UK recruit picked up for 4,000gns in October; 1-10 on turf for Michael Dods, the win coming over 1m1f on good to firm off 53; this trip might just be on the sharp side, he lacks a run and he is probably best watched.

🔦 Spotlight: Has won four on the AW and is 1-12 on turf; posted a good effort behind Higher Kingdom at Dundalk in this headgear combination in November but has gone off the boil since; no signs of a revival on return to turf at Leopardstown latest; others look more likely.
Horse quote: 2023-11-03 at Dundalk (AW) (8f): "Feature This likes it up here. I was trying to get her to stay further but that's probably her trip. There was not much pace which probably suited her. She battled well and will probably keep going up here for the winter - Paul Flynn, trainer"

💬 Comment: 0-16 on turf, good run on latest at Gowran, very soft ground would be a worry; reserve
🔦 Spotlight: Third reserve; 0-16 on turf but has shown ability; best effort for current yard on latest at Gowran (1m, yielding); pick of his form is on good ground; well-beaten on only previous visit to this venue; others appeal more.
