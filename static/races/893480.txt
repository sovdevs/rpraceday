💬 Comment: Good fourths at Leopardstown of late; drop in trip is fine and should be involved again
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win came in sprint maiden at Sligo (soft) in 2023; major step back in right direction recently with pair of fourths at Leopardstown over 1m-1m1f; drop in trip is fine and should be involved again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Never-nearer 3rd at Navan; step up in trip will suit; has the rail draw; leading contender
🔦 Spotlight: 3-39 on turf, last successful at Navan (6f, soft) in October 2023; 2lb lower here and caught the eye when a never-nearer third at Navan (6f) 15 days ago; step up in trip will suit and has the rail draw; leading contender.
Horse quote: 2021-06-09 at Cork (7f): "Navorrosse had a good run last time and they filled me with confidence beforehand. She's been unlucky on a couple of occasions and has been threatening to do something like that at home. She rode like a filly that could possibly be well handicapped. She handled the ground well but has form on quicker ground. I think she'd also get further so hopefully they'll have fun with her - Colin Keane, rider."

💬 Comment: Sixth of 10 at Leopardstown two weeks ago; might want a sounder surface than this
🔦 Spotlight: Only beaten half a length in Dundalk claimer in January; looked in need of the run on first start for this yard when sixth of 10 at Leopardstown two weeks ago; might want a sounder surface than this; will appreciate a strong pace to aim at.
Horse quote: 2022-09-24 at Curragh (7f): "Half Nutz is very straightforward but it just didn't fall right for him a few times. I was very happy with the way he ran in Listowel, he didn't get much of a run there. He's a horse that has to be ridden for luck, it didn't happen in Listowel but it happened today - Johnny Murtagh, trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-08-16 at Gowran Park (7f): "The Fog Horn likes it here and likes a bit of better ground. It was a little bit too soft for her the last day and James gave her a great ride out in front today from a good draw. We'll see what the handicapper does, he gave her 12lb the last time she won which was plenty so we claimed off her today which made a difference - Seamus O'Donnell, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Third reserve; three-time winner on turf but has been off the boil for some time; soft ground fine and well handicapped if he can recapture some form.
Horse quote: 2021-07-14 at Killarney (8f): "Swiss Army Officer was running in big fields at Leopardstown all season and was never beaten far. He needs his own way and he got it. Emmet kidded him along and he won well in the end. These races are probably ideal for him - Kevin Coleman, trainer."
