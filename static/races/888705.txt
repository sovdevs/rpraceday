💬 Comment: 📈 progressive last season, not a bad run in the Thyestes on seasonal debut, can do better
🔦 Spotlight: Won three of his last four starts last season, culminating in a valuable novice handicap win at Navan, just getting the better of Ask Anything; raised 12lb for that, ran respectably without the benefit of a run when fifth in the Thyestes, weakening after a bad mistake two out; open to improvement from that.

🔦 Spotlight: Won this race by 16l last season off an 8lb lower mark; no comparable form since with jumping issues now a serious concern; was attempting to challenge form well off the pace when sprawling badly four out in the Welsh National on penultimate start, pulled up soon after; jumped badly when last of 15 finishers in the Thyestes.
