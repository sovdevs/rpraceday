🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pays for his consistency but will be happier back up from 1m and should go well again
🔦 Spotlight: Run well in three starts back from an absence this winter but has been beaten at short prices each time and pays for his consistency (2lb higher than when last winning 18 months ago); will be happier back up from 1m and should go well again.
