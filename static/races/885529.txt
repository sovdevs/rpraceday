🔦 Spotlight: Second past the post at Kempton (1m3f) on Wednesday under Warren Fentiman but awarded the race after being carried left in the closing stages; first-time visor worn on that occasion is retained; 5lb penalty now and Fentiman is on connections' Khangai this time.

💬 Comment: Three wins since joining James Owen including over C&D; fair fourth here latest; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Has done well on AW for current yard, winning three times, including over C&D; offered enough when fourth over C&D last time to think he's still in form; 7lb claimer Warren Fentiman partnered Kinetic to victory for the same connections at Kempton on Wednesday, but switches to this one now; respected.
