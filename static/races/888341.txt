🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not as good as he was but that's reflected in his mark and he ran well last time
🔦 Spotlight: Like Aucunrisque, he's a former winner of the big handicap hurdle here in February (2022); missed all of last season but might be coming to the boil again after a closing third under Cameron Iles at Kempton over Christmas (2m, good to soft); he's not the force of old but that's reflected in his mark; respected.

💬 Comment: Up in grade from Exeter but performed well in defeat and should give his running
🔦 Spotlight: Back-to-back wins in these colours last spring (on good) when trained by David Pipe; 9lb higher than for the last of those and 3lb higher than for his recent second at Exeter when plenty looked in his favour; that was at least a positive performance and not all in here ran that well last time.

🔦 Spotlight: Beat subsequent Grade 2 winner Sixmilebridge at Stratford in October and nearly beat another smart novice (third in the recent EBF Final) at Doncaster two runs ago (again on good to soft); made a mid-race mistake and didn't look that at ease on heavy ground when coming up short at Exeter; has to be of interest in his first handicap.

💬 Comment: Four-time winner in France and he's an interesting one on his handicap debut in Britain
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French and won twice on the Flat and over hurdles (effective in a hood) in these same colours; finished a remote fourth to the smart Kalif Du Berlais in a juvenile hurdle at Kempton 13 months ago on only previous British start; may prefer softer ground but he's an interesting one on his handicap debut in Britain.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has the form to play a part but wellbeing is an issue after so long on the sidelines
🔦 Spotlight: Flat background; could be interesting if returning to the form he showed when second at Lingfield 13 months ago (2m3f, soft; fine on good) but that's a big if after so long on the sidelines.
