🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Capable of much better than we saw on return
🔦 Spotlight: Won three of his nine starts last year; sent off favourite when back from 168 days off at Wolverhampton last month but things didn't go his way (left poorly placed and hung off the home turn); better expected here; yard won this in 2024.
