🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden has run well in defeat several times including on recent return; player up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden ran well in defeat several times as a 2yo but was below form both 3yo starts; however, came back to form on recent return at Gowran over just short of 1m2f; looks a 🔥 big player up in trip if she stays with Keane staying aboard.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual-purpose winner hasn't been seen since running over hurdles over three years ago
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose winner hasn't been seen since running over hurdles (fourth in a Grade 3) over three years ago; 11yo can only be watched.
Horse quote: 2020-10-25 at Wexford (20f): "The ground was just a bit too good for her the last day and the way the race was run didn't suit her. The softer ground today was a big help; she is small but very tough - rider Ambrose McCurtin."
