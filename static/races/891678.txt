🔦 Spotlight: 3m point winner and won a good-ground bumper in October; made a positive start over hurdles when third of four at Ludlow (2m5f, good) against two talented principals; absent since early November but should improve and that would put him firmly in the picture.

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in both his Irish points; sold for 80,000euros last May and had wind surgery in September; tongue tied when the clear outsider in C&D maiden (good) five weeks ago and he showed significant ability and promise despite tiring into last of three; should be a leading contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Won an Irish point last February before his £175,000 sale; second at Leicester (good to soft) in November and fourth of nine at Ffos Las (heavy) in December, both over about 2m4f, and he'll probably stay 3m; a tongue-tie is added and he can still improve, which is needed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Upped in trip and back on better ground but no appeal just yet
🔦 Spotlight: Second and first in two point bumpers last May, but he's met with heavy defeats this year in a bumper and two heavy-ground races over hurdles; upped in trip and back on better ground but no appeal just yet.
