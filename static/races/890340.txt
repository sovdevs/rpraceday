🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the Coventry prior to running well in French Group 1 races; sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Developed well as a 2yo, good second in Group 1 races at Deauville (6f) and Longchamp (7f) the last twice, showing that his 80-1 success in the Coventry was no fluke; sets a smart standard on those French efforts and accordingly warrants respect, assuming he can transfer the form back to home soil.
Horse quote: 2024-08-18 at Deauville (6f): "No disrespect to the winner, you can never say anything like that, but if we'd had the rail I think Rashabar would have won. It was a really good, solid run and the horse is progressing, as it's one of the toughest Prix Mornys I've seen in a number of years. I've won the race twice and this horse is better [than Bad As I Wanna Be and Arcano]. What I really want to do is take him to the Breeders' Cup. I think he'll travel well and we'll work from that - Brian Meehan, trainer."

💬 Comment: Two emphatic wins at Doncaster suggest he's a Group colt in the making; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Son of Kingman, who won this race in 2014; shouldn't be judged harshly on Ascot defeat where Al Qudra had his own way up front; that is flanked by emphatic wins (6f/7f) at Doncaster, looking a Group colt in the making; withdrawn (broke out of stalls) when favourite for the Champagne Stakes there in September; remains of strong interest.

💬 Comment: Raced twice for Sir Michael Stoute; looked a good prospect on debut; possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: Raced twice (7f) for Sir Michael Stoute, overcoming trouble to win at Sandown then disappointing at Doncaster (Listed) where the market signals proved weak; looked a good prospect on debut and has clear possibilities for 🆕 new yard provided that promise is confirmed.
Horse quote: 2024-08-30 at Sandown (7f): "Jonquil will have learned a lot from today. He's a nice two-year-old and he's got the pedigree and physique to back it up. They were always quite positive when they sent him from Juddmonte and he's shown a gritty attitude. It was nice to see him come back at the end. There's stamina in his pedigree but he's got that bit of speed from his dam too. Seven furlongs is okay for now, but I'm pretty sure he'd stay a mile this year if we wanted him to, and further next year. It's exciting. He's got a nice future - James Savage, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: 📈 progressive on British soil; globetrotter subsequently; 🔥 big player on the figures
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive form on British soil culminated in Listed win at Ascot; has been globetrotting since, best form when second in Canadian Grade 1; always in command in a Qatar race most recently, taking 7f record to 2-2; has raced nine times already and may not have much more improvement left in the locker; however, 🔥 big player on ratings.
Horse quote: 2025-02-16 at Al Uqda (7f): "It was a straightforward win. Al Qudra is a solid little horse and brought good form into the race. I rode him in Dubai when he was second last time, and he was entitled to improve for that and duly did. He's got a great attitude. He stays a mile but he's not short of boot, and fast ground suits him well - William Buick, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-10-22 at Curragh (6f): "Saracen was impressive. He had been showing up well at home and looks a smart horse for next season. He should come back for a Guineas trial of some sort in the spring - Joseph O'Brien, trainer."
