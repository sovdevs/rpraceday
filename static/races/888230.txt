🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dotted up on Monday's Plumpton chase debut (2m4f, good); penalty ought not contain her.
🔦 Spotlight: Emphatic winner on Monday's Plumpton chase debut (2m4f, good), and even penalised her mark pales next to the RPR run to there; didn't mind taking a lead that time, but no surprise to see a resumption of the front-running tactics already successfully deployed in a bumper and Irish point.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Belated first chase win last time (2m4f, soft), albeit the race fell apart; more needed.
🔦 Spotlight: Last-time win in a Leicester mares' handicap (2m4f, soft) was a first in 19 races over fences and can be crabbed, the rider of the only other finisher having lost their whip; 2lb higher mark still compares most favourably to her peak French 2021-22 form, but not sure a corner's been turned.
