🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Maiden hurdle winner on this card last term; good 4th to Dancing City but poor run since
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner on this card last year and ran a cracker behind stablemate Dancing City on his chase debut this season, despite making a host of errors; however, his jumping caught him out when a beaten favourite in a beginners' at Navan since; shorter trip may not help with his jumping but he's a 🔥 big player if he can put in a clear round.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big run on chase debut at 2023 Galway Festival and belated return wasn't devoid of promise
🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner a few seasons ago and there was a lot to like when runner-up to Mars Harper on his chase debut at the 2023 Galway Festival in beginners' company; shaped like he needed his only subsequent start in another Galway beginners' in October and could be a 🔥 big player if he comes on for that first start in 451 days.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 📈 progressive over timber last term; promise over fences so far but errors have cost him
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive over hurdles last season; errors have cost him over fences this term; was roughly 6l behind Majborough when coming down at the last on chase debut; respectable effort despite finishing fourth of four but was tailed off after making errors at Gowran since; will be involved if he can put a clear round together.
