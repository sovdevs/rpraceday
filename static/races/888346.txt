🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won her last two; tops the weights for this handicap debut but scored easily last time
🔦 Spotlight: Point and dual bumper winner and she's now starting to deliver on that promise, short-priced favourite when winning on good to soft in a maiden at Ludlow (2m5f) and novice at Southwell (extended 2m5f; made all from La Pinsonniere) on her last two starts; tops the weights for this handicap debut but scored easily last time.

💬 Comment: Finished well to win 16-runner race at Warwick (2m5f, soft; from Come On Nia) last time
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper win on good last April; favourite in all three hurdle races, runner-up twice but making no mistake in 16-runner race at Warwick (2m5f, soft; from Come On Nia) on New Year's Eve last time despite having to be switched markedly; can still do better but this slight drop back in trip is a little worrying given her strength at the finish last time; stable runs three.

🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French mare who's had one win (2m Huntingdon maiden) and two seconds from her three starts in Britain, all on good to soft; could not hold a candle to Jasmine Bliss in the closing stages at Southwell (2m4f) 19 days ago, which sees her 7lb better off today but she'll need much better than that performance; cheekpieces are given a go; stable runs three.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Soundly beaten sixth on handicap debut here but easily made all on starts either side
🔦 Spotlight: Made her mark in bumpers and easily made all over hurdles in a maiden at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) and four-runner novice at Ffos Las (2m, heavy); tongue tied first time in the latter, having been soundly beaten sixth on handicap debut here (2m) on penultimate start; could still be capable of better.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed over hurdles and fences in France before making all in three-runner 3yo hurdle on British debut at Huntingdon (2m, soft) in December, the two backward steps since are a worry but heavy ground was an excuse last time and she now goes beyond 2m1f for first time since her French days.

💬 Comment: 1-10 record over hurdles, best over Ludlow's 2m5f on last three starts; off three months
🔦 Spotlight: Not lacking in experience with her 1-10 record over hurdles, best efforts over Ludlow's 2m5f (good/good to soft) on last three outings; given wind surgery before latest; absent three months and needs to pull out extra against rivals who appear less exposed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd to Crazierthandaisy at Warwick (2m5f); heavy ground an excuse behind Sunset Marquesa
🔦 Spotlight: Always claimer ridden; won handicaps last May (good to soft) and June (good); two seconds late in the year, latterly behind Crazierthandaisy at Warwick (2m5f, soft) when hanging left on the run-in may have conceded the initiative; heavy ground was presumably the excuse behind Sunset Marquesa on latest start but overall improvement is needed.

🔦 Spotlight: Stayed on well to win on her hurdle debut at Uttoxeter (2m, good) in November; good third at Ludlow (2m5f, good to soft) next time but tailed off on handicap debut at Sandown (2m4f, soft) last month; maybe the return to better ground will help; one of three in this for her stable.
