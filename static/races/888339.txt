🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Now tackles his first handicap and doesn't look overburdened off this mark
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced; won two bumpers and an Ascot novice hurdle for Chris Gordon; some doubts over what he's actually achieved in finishing runner-up in two small-field chases for this yard (tongue tied), latterly when no match for Cheltenham runner-up The Changing Man in the Grade 2 Reynoldstown at Ascot (3m, good); however, now tackles his first handicap and doesn't look overburdened off this mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Goes on any ground; has won two of his last three chases, the latest in a first-time hood when much too good for his two rivals at Plumpton (3m1f, good); has more on his plate here now penalised (effectively 6lb higher) against classier opposition.

🔦 Spotlight: Only had two runs over fences, winning the latest over this sort of trip on good ground at Chepstow earlier this season; had continued the good work over hurdles until pulling up last time on heavy ground; has to prove himself worthy of this high a mark but could easily threaten.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't built on his Wetherby win but drying conditions would be very favourable
🔦 Spotlight: Won in a small field at Wetherby in November (extended 2m3f; good) on his second run for this yard but hasn't built on that in a big way and his jumping let him down last time (good to soft); however, if the ground dried out to bordering on good then that would help; stays this far.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: More exposed than some in here but he can be competitive off this mark
🔦 Spotlight: Has done well since switched to this discipline (winning twice) and his blowouts have come in strong races, latterly in the 2m4f Greatwood Gold Cup here three weeks ago; more exposed than some in here and he's unraced past 2m5f, but can be competitive off this mark.

💬 Comment: Consistent over fences (0-4) but will need to raise his game in the first-time cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Recruited out of a selling hurdle last spring; beaten four times over fences and, although he got closer last time at Wetherby when seemingly outstayed over 3m, this represents a rise in class and he'll need to lift his game in the first-time cheekpieces.
