🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point win; close fourth in novice at Warwick (2m3f, good to soft; 6-1) sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Won an Irish point in November 2023 and was sold for £75,000; not seen again until three weeks ago but stuck to her task very well to be a close fourth of ten from off the pace in mares' novice at Warwick (2m3f, good to soft; 6-1); sets the standard on that form and looks promising.

🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts to be placed on good ground at Warwick (2m5f) and Hereford (2m4f; 19l second) on last two starts; better is needed if she's to win this and she was soundly beaten in two soft-ground bumpers.

🔦 Spotlight: Won an Irish point in November 2023 and was sold for £75,000; not seen again until three weeks ago but stuck to her task very well to be a close fourth of ten from off the pace in mares' novice at Warwick (2m3f, good to soft; 6-1); sets the standard on that form and looks promising.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point and bumper winner; however, backward steps in her two hurdle races (2m, soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Won Irish maiden point at fourth attempt, followed by front-running win at Uttoxeter (soft) last April in her only bumper; backward steps in her two hurdle races (2m, soft) so others now have more pressing claims.
