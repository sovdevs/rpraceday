🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has made all for his recent wins and looks 📈 progressive; raised 8lb for last time
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced chaser who has improved to win his last two races at about 3m (from the front), on good to soft at Uttoxeter and heavy at Chepstow; raised 8lb for last time but won nicely and the runner-up has done well since; obvious claims.
