💬 Comment: Promising third in C&D event five months ago; respected with progress plausible
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a bumper/Flat winner; absent since her promising third in newcomers' event over C&D (good) five months ago; presumably saved for spring ground and warrants respect with progress plausible.
