🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Leading contender on his Newmarket win; ✂️ gelded since and back from 18-month absence
🔦 Spotlight: Absent since recording a useful RPR with emphatic success over 1m2f at Newmarket 18 months ago (second start); ✂️ gelded during his time off; leading contender provided he returns in the same form.
Horse quote: 2023-10-25 at Newmarket (10f): "Anzac Day had run an encouraging first race at Goodwood and Andrew Balding said he had moved forward from that. He was out on the wing and had no cover so did well in the circumstances - James Doyle, rider."
