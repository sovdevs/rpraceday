🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Built on his promising debut when making all at Southwell last month; the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: 135,000gns yearling; caught the eye when fourth of 12 on his debut here (7f) in December and built on that when making all in a Southwell maiden (1m, Tapeta) last month; opening mark looks fair and he may well show further improvement now handicapping; the one to beat.
