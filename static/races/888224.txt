📝 Comment: in rear, outpaced and no chance before 3 out, slow jump 2 out, went modest fourth last, stayed on (jockey said, regarding running and riding, that his instructions were to take his time on gelding, with an emphasis on getting gelding relaxed and jumping for this hurdling debut; he indicated early pace was strong, before steadying up through middle stages; however they got racing again from 4th last; he added he asked gelding to quicken down the side but response was limited and gelding was effectively staying on at one pace; gelding was novicey at 3rd last, which he ballooned losing him ground and momentum; he wanted to keep the bit up in gelding's mouth thereafter; however gelding produced a similarly inefficient jump at 2 out, again landing awkwardly; it was important for him to see a stride and ensure gelding produced a better jump at the last and from that point he rode gelding out firmly and, whilst staying on pleasingly, he did feel his finishing effort was flattered by 3rd placed horse weakening; his explanation was noted)
