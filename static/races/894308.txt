🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Strong traveller and a good jumper; hard to beat with a repeat of her Cheltenham second
🔦 Spotlight: Smart Flat stayer who finished third in last year's Irish Cesarewitch on good ground; her jumping was noticeably slick when switched to hurdles at Fairyhouse in January and again when narrowly failing to justify market confidence in the Grade 2 Dawn Run at Cheltenham (2m1f, good to soft); strong traveller who brings the best form into this and hard to beat.
Horse quote: 2025-03-13 at Cheltenham (17f): "Sixandahalf ran really well - jumped and travelled really well everywhere, and probably just could have done with something to lead her a bit further. I did think after jumping the last that she was going to go away and win. I suppose there was a target on my back then. She jumped brilliantly and didn't do anything wrong - she just got beat - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Something to find with Sixandahalf and will need to run better than at Fairyhouse latest
🔦 Spotlight: Smart bumper form in France; 4-9 when winning her maiden and then finished about 9l behind Sixandahalf at Cheltenham where she got outpaced on good to soft; may lack the gears for this under today's conditions and she needs to bounce back from a modest run at Fairyhouse (2m4f Grade 1); still has place claims.

🔦 Spotlight: Third in a 2m4f Grade 1 at Fairyhouse last time (soft/heavy), reversing Cheltenham form with stablemate Karoline Banbou when both finished some way behind Sixandahalf; relying on the latter being below-par if she's to win this, but considered each-way.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Would have each-way claims if responding positively to the new headgear
🔦 Spotlight: A new visor replaces the tongue-tie after finishing a well-held fourth when made favourite for a Grade 3 at Limerick last time; ran pretty well in her three previous races won by the likes of The Yellow Clay, The Big Westerner and Final Demand; softer ground might be preferred but would have each-way claims if responding positively to the new headgear.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-3 over hurdles against inferior opposition; ⬆️ up in class but Flat ability is respected
🔦 Spotlight: Useful Flat performer in France and has made light work of inferior opposition in three 2m hurdle starts for Nicky Henderson, last time going off at 1-25 at Chepstow; this represents a huge rise in class but she's likeable (seems uncomplicated) and her Flat ability has to be respected.
Horse quote: 2025-02-20 at Huntingdon (16f): "Timetoshine was a very green on her first go over hurdles and got into the bottom of a few, but finished well off a strong pace. The members were worried about the market drift, but I just told them they would get more if they backed her. I don't know about future plans, but she probably wants more experience - Anthony Bromley, owners' representative."
