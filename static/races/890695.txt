💬 Comment: Yet to fire for current stable but has lots of ability and return of headgear is a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Not short of ability but inconsistent for his former yard and he's yet to shine in two runs for new connections; dangerous mark and fully effective over C&D so can't be ruled out with cheekpieces now refitted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-4 on AW but a repeat of any of those Tapeta runs would give him leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Dropped away in the final furlong on reappearance at Doncaster (5f, good) recently; attracted support so the run might not have been needed but he's on a dangerous mark and AW record of 0-4 is slightly misleading as he's recorded RPRs of 89, 83, 72 and 74; fully effective at 6f and high on the list.
Horse quote: 2022-09-16 at Ayr (6f): "Mattice is only a three-year-old and there could be some good days for him in the future - Tim Easterby, trainer."
