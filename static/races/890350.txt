💬 Comment: Big improvement when going close at Leicester and sets fair standard on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't show a great deal at 50-1 in the Brocklesby (good to soft) but he left that form well behind when a close second at Leicester (good to firm) last Friday; sets fair standard on that front-running effort and he should continue to progress.
