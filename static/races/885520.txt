💬 Comment: In the frame in seven of his nine starts; has the best form of those with experience
🔦 Spotlight: In the frame in seven of his nine starts, the latest when third of ten finishers in a Wolverhampton maiden (1m4f, Tapeta) in December (has undergone wind surgery since); not sure dropping in trip will help, but he still has the best form of those with experience.
