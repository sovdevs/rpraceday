🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well when second at Catterick 11 days ago; 5lb below last winning mark; major player
🔦 Spotlight: Course winner (6f) whose three successes last year came over 5f; ran well when second of 13 at Catterick (5f, good to firm) 11 days ago and a 1lb rise for that still leaves her 5lb below her last winning mark; major player.
Horse quote: 2024-01-27 at Newcastle (AW) (5f): "She's a really game mare. I thought Hurt You Never might need the run but she showed she's in great form. Early on I thought I'd gone a bit quick but she just kept powering through - Mia Nicholls, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner last autumn; has a bit to find with Hurt You Never on recent Catterick running
🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner last September (good to soft) and made a successful reappearance at Musselburgh (5f, good) last month, but finished nearly 2l behind Hurt You Never at Catterick (5f, good to firm) 11 days ago and is just 1lb better off; cheekpieces return.
Horse quote: 2024-09-22 at Hamilton (5f): "We kept it simple and got the job done. Kyber Crystal has plenty of form on soft ground, so hopefully we should have some fun with her through the autumn - Rebecca Menzies, speaking to Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2020-11-04 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "Newyorkstateofmind picked up for me in the straight, he's very honest and genuine. The gap opened up for us. He's been in great form lately - Ray Dawson."

💬 Comment: Has failed to beat a rival in three starts since returning in March
🔦 Spotlight: 7lb lower than when winning at Wolverhampton (6f, AW) last summer but has shown nothing for this yard, failing to beat a rival in three starts since returning in March; cheekpieces return.
Horse quote: 2024-07-08 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "Six [furlongs] is definitely Carmarthen's trip. She leaves a lot for herself, I'm not saying she's ungenuine but she's still learning and it took a horse to come to her before she could put the race to bed. She idled pretty much the whole way and, if we direct her the right way, she should be winning again  - Edward Greatrex, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
