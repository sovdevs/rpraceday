🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in a Wetherby bumper (2m, good to soft) on debut in December and when switched to hurdling here (2m, heavy) last month; finished 5l ahead of Blue Bellamy in the latter and open to progress on this step up in trip; interesting contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sets the standard on his best form but was disappointing when odds-on at Plumpton latest
🔦 Spotlight: Won Irish point last May just before £85,000 sale; promising third on hurdling debut at Plumpton (2m4f, good to soft) in December but he had a bad experience at Ascot (brought down) next time and was disappointing when odds-on at Plumpton last month; has bit to prove all of a sudden and he needs to get back in the groove.

💬 Comment: Eyecatching third at Taunton last time and he looks interesting on this step up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Well-held fourth in sole Irish point last spring; same outcome on hurdling debut at Ludlow in December but he found improvement with his rallying third at Taunton (2m, soft) last month; that was an eyecatching effort and he could have a big role to play over this longer trip.

💰 Odds: 33.0 ❄️
📝 Comment: in rear, outpaced and no chance before 3 out, slow jump 2 out, went modest fourth last, stayed on (jockey said, regarding running and riding, that his instructions were to take his time on gelding, with an emphasis on getting gelding relaxed and jumping for this hurdling debut; he indicated early pace was strong, before steadying up through middle stages; however they got racing again from 4th last; he added he asked gelding to quicken down the side but response was limited and gelding was effectively staying on at one pace; gelding was novicey at 3rd last, which he ballooned losing him ground and momentum; he wanted to keep the bit up in gelding's mouth thereafter; however gelding produced a similarly inefficient jump at 2 out, again landing awkwardly; it was important for him to see a stride and ensure gelding produced a better jump at the last and from that point he rode gelding out firmly and, whilst staying on pleasingly, he did feel his finishing effort was flattered by 3rd placed horse weakening; his explanation was noted)

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful in bumpers, including an AW win here, but his last run was almost two years ago and he has bit to prove now switched to hurdling after a long absence; market should guide.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in the first of her two bumpers and was third on hurdling debut at Hereford (2m, soft) last month; 20l adrift in the latter but caught the eye with his late headway and that was behind a useful prospect; yard won this last year and he's not ruled upped in trip.
