🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Graded form; back from pacemaking duties with a big chance running on his own merits
🔦 Spotlight: Sole hurdles win came in Leopardstown maiden late 2023 but has run to a smart level of form in Graded company on several occasions; employed as a pacemaker in recent starts but running on his own merits here and 🔥 big player.
Horse quote: 2023-12-26 at Leopardstown (16f): "We were riding King Of Kingsfield all wrong and the last day we changed our minds. He's been disappointing up until now as I always thought he was a proper horse but he might just come good now. The ground is key to him - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Former Grade 3 winner; regressive but could still hold his own in this company
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who won two Grade 3s at Tipperary in 2023; returned from year's absence at Christmas and well below his best in five outings, some admittedly stiff tasks; bit more spark when beaten under 9l in County Hurdle last time; regressive but could still hold his own in this company and well treated by the race conditions.
Horse quote: 2023-07-06 at Tipperary (16f): "He just beat Cash Back at Ballinrobe so Fils D'oudairies has come forward from that, hopefully he'll keep going. I was waiting for Sharjah the whole way up the straight but to be fair he galloped all the way to the line. He jumps and travels so I'd say he would be entitled to take his chance at Galway - Jack Kennedy, jockey, talking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First hurdles run in over a year and hasn't run since last August; may need this
🔦 Spotlight: 5yo is 2-4 hurdling, last run in this code when fourth behind Sir Gino in Grade 1 juvenile hurdle at Aintree a year ago; kept busy on the Flat last summer, winning Sligo maiden and good fourth in Curragh handicap best efforts; absent since August and may just need this.
Horse quote: 2024-05-15 at Sligo (10.5f): "It was fairly plain sailing for Intellotto today. I just let him bowl away and he stayed at it good. He was only just doing what he needed to. He did roll around a little bit up the straight but, kept up to his work, he stuck his head out and got through the line well - Dylan Browne McMonagle, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lincoln third should have set him up nicely for this; bit to find but could go well
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful dual-purpose performer; won first two attempts hurdling in 2023, has come up short in Graded company; fine comeback third of 27 in Irish Lincoln last month, however, and that should have set hm up nicely for this; no surprise if he played a role.
Horse quote: 2024-10-22 at Curragh (12f): "Smooth Tom is a very versatile horse and I would say he'll stay further. I forgot to enter him in the Irish Cesarewitch and I think it would have suited him. We'll probably go for the Grade 3 hurdle at Down Royal a week on Friday. He likes small fields and he can pick up some more prize-money - Andy Slattery, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Poor strike rate but runs well in these types of events so don't rule out
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't added to Navan maiden win of 16 months ago but some fair efforts in small-runner conditions hurdles; tame handicap effort last time in January though; bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2023-12-09 at Navan (16f): "It was a good performance from Jigoro and we knew he had improved plenty from the first day. Obviously there was a lot of talk about Tom Cooper's horse and I thought it was a good performance. Jack was delighted with him and said he'll stay further. He said a faster gallop would have suited him but he was very happy with the run. He could go for the four-year-old hurdle at Limerick over Christmas - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Limerick maiden winner looks out of his depth here
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner off the mark hurdling in 2m3f Limerick maiden at Christmas but pulled up in Fairyhouse handicap when last seen in February; appears out of his depth here.
Horse quote: 2024-12-29 at Limerick (19f): "Way Down South can be quite hard on himself, so we said we'd jump him out in front and see how we get on. I'm delighted it worked out and he is a nice horse for the future - Gillian Scott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair Flat handicapper, handles all sorts of ground; very big ask on belated hurdles debut
🔦 Spotlight: Fair Flat handicapper, five turf wins on all sorts of ground; very big ask here on belated hurdles debut.
Horse quote: 2023-08-05 at Galway (7f): "Dragon Of Malta's form is very solid and there were a lot of ducks in a row today. It is hard to get him early in the year but he comes to form in the autumn and that's just him - Pat O'Donnell, trainer"
