🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has become a powerhouse in this division; better than ever judged on last two performances
🔦 Spotlight: Acts on any ground; withdrawn from this contest 12 months ago when his stable was under a big cloud; has become a powerhouse in this division and readily beat Energumene in the Clarence House at Ascot most recently, registering an eighth Grade 1 success over fences; has met his only defeats at Cheltenham, including twice at the Festival (admittedly a creditable second both times), and two Shloer wins over C&D do not feature among his best figures; furthermore, favourites have a notoriously bad record (only three wins and several dismal flops) in this race in the last decade; those doubts aside, he's better than ever judged on last two performances and the clear pick on current form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won the Supreme here in 2023; produced a career-best effort last time; commands respect
🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on heavy, acts on any other ground; unbeaten spell featured a ready success in the Supreme at this meeting two years ago when given a superb ride by the late and greatly missed Michael O'Sullivan; 0-4 since successful debut over fences but ran very well (produced a career-best RPR) in the Dublin Chase at Leopardstown most recently, emerging from the chasing pack to finish only 2l behind Solness and pull clear of the remainder; peaking at the right time and, with a fast pace likely, the cards could drop perfectly on this return to Cheltenham; respected, with further progress very plausible.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual winner of this contest; veteran now and he was beaten by Jonbon at Ascot last time
🔦 Spotlight: Major force in this division in his prime and recorded emphatic wins in this contest in 2022 (albeit with the race falling apart) and 2023, both on soft; successful in Cork Grade 2 and second to Jonbon in Ascot Grade 1 since returning from lengthy layoff, doing enough to put him in calculations in this third Champion Chase attempt; sets the standard on peak figures, but whether he's capable of reproducing them at the age of 11 is open to doubt.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has shown major improvement with front-running Grade 1 wins at Leopardstown the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Looked a notch or two below championship standard for most of his career; however, he's taken his form to a completely new level with front-running Grade 1 wins at Leopardstown (yielding/good to yielding) the last twice, both times establishing a clear lead at various points and not for catching; stuck on gamely to beat Marine Nationale by 2l latest, confirming his sudden emergence as a realistic Champion Chase contender; possibilities, provided he's able to dominate in the same manner.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Rare blip last time; solid record otherwise over fences; runner-up in last year's Arkle
🔦 Spotlight: Sometimes jumps right; probably best to forgive his rare blip last time, as he was found to have a slight bilateral nasal discharge after the race; chase record otherwise reads 12122111, beating Solness by a neck in Navan Grade 2 the final occasion; respectable second in the Arkle at this meeting last year and was a dual Grade 1 scorer during that novice campaign; likely to bounce back and perform well.

🔦 Spotlight: Has performed well in both Champion Chase attempts but proved no match for Energumene in 2023 and looked a fortuitous winner last year when the race fell apart (Jonbon was withdrawn and odds-on El Fabiolo failed to complete); his recent form adds doubt, having been well held in Leopardstown contests won by Solness the last twice.
