🔦 Spotlight: Failed to win last year but returned to winning ways on his seasonal debut at Pontefract (1m, good) last month; up 5lb and may struggle to follow up.
Horse quote: 2023-08-12 at Haydock (8f): "Leadenhall has always had a lot of talent. They've ironed out a few of his issues, the headgear was off today and it worked out nicely. Hopefully this will be a confidence booster - Hector Crouch, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Has improved this season in two runs on AW after missing last year; scored at Newcastle (1m) 17 days ago and should run well if able to translate current form to turf.
Horse quote: 2025-05-02 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "Savvy Kingdom is a very nice horse. Fair play to Mr Woods [trainer] and the team at home. He had a little setback but the owners have been very patient and it's paid off. We'll be going a mile and two [furlongs] I'd say with him next time on turf and that should suit him perfectly - Ben Sanderson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Raced too freely following a slow start back on turf at Ripon last month; best watched.
🔦 Spotlight: Won three in a row last summer but has lost his way a bit this year; raced too freely following slow start back on turf when last of eight at Ripon (1m, good) last month; still 12lb above last winning mark; best watched.
Horse quote: 2024-08-11 at Ripon (8f): "The race was run to suit. We thought they were going to go very quick and I said to Ellie 'whatever you do, don't panic.' She gave Bowood a perfect ride. The change of scenery has probably done the trick with him, he's a very happy horse at the moment. He's progressing and I hope he can still do a bit more. I think he'll stay a mile and a quarter in time - Ivan Furtado, trainer."
