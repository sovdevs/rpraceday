🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-3 in France last year but both British runs have been underwhelming; headgear applied
🔦 Spotlight: 2-3 over hurdles in France last year but made rather underwhelming British debut in Musselburgh Listed race last month and dropped out very tamely when eased in grade at Kelso a fortnight later; needs help from the first-time cheekpieces here.
