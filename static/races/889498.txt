💬 Comment: Three wins at 1m2f and 1m3f for previous yard last summer; hurdle debut; betting helpful
🔦 Spotlight: Had fine spell for the Kublers on the Flat last summer, winning three on the trot at 1m2f (turf; RPR 94) and 1m3f (AW); was below that level for this yard in late 2024, but dam's successful offspring include a winning hurdler so there are hopes he can take to this game; betting helpful.
