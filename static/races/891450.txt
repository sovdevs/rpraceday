🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Third of 16 in the Melrose at York (good to firm) and won at Haydock (good), both at 1m6f
🔦 Spotlight: Largely dodged fast ground last season but third of 16 in the Melrose at York (good to firm) and won at Haydock (good) next time; both of those (his best efforts) were at 1m6f with waiting tactics and there is a question over whether 1m4f is ideal, but he starts this campaign with potential.
Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Haydock (14f): "Master Builder did something really nice in the Melrose and we were quite confident that with a bit of cut in the ground, he would improve again. He switches off easily and quickly and they went very fast early on, so I wasn't too worried. You could see he was picking up the bridle and travelling better than anything else - David Menuisier, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back up another 3lb but return to turf should be fine; respected as an in-form contender
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten in 2022 on his only race at Epsom; move back to Flat this year has seen a resurgence in fortunes over 1m4f on Kempton AW last two starts, in which he was first beaten a nose and then made no mistake; back up another 3lb but return to turf should be fine and he's respected as an in-form contender.
Horse quote: 2023-11-12 at Sandown (16f): "I was a bit surprised Arqoob went off favourite. We thought he had an each-way shout, but it is tough out there as the ground is testing. He was probably not in love with it, but he does like that hill. Bryony just waited a bit longer than normal and I think that was pretty key. He winged the last and that really sealed it. He is so consistent that you could set your watch by him. We will go home and look what there is for him, but I suppose we might be thinking about the Imperial Cup later in the season if we get his rating high enough - Lucy Wadham, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tremendously 📈 progressive 2024 on the Flat included two wins over C&D in the mud
🔦 Spotlight: Had five wins in a tremendously 📈 progressive 2024 campaign on the Flat, with two of those wins over C&D in the mud; first and second in two hurdle races late in the year; needs to resume improvement and a move back from testing ground poses a big question; stable runs three.
Horse quote: 2024-09-29 at Epsom (12f): "The ground is key to Miller Spirit and he loves that bit of give in it. We knew after he went well there last time that we had to come back for this. He's a nice horse but is very big, so was always going to improve from what he did last year - Gary Moore, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Respectable fifth over C&D last June on his only visit here; that followed three wins (two on good ground) in the spring and he's now just 1lb above his last winning mark; still no joy over hurdles this winter and absent since December but a case can be made; stable runs three.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark in AW novice (8.6f) last July and got up close home in an Epsom handicap (1m2f, good; unraced on firmer) in August; creditable fourth at Wolverhampton (AW) in October probably showed that he stays 1m4f; ✂️ gelded since and he may well have more to offer at this trip; interesting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flourished in July-October with three wins (two C&D) and three 2nds in space of six races
🔦 Spotlight: Flourished last July-October with three wins and three seconds in the space of six races, with the second of those wins over C&D; two modest runs over hurdles late in the year; more to prove on good or good to firm but he's respected for last season's progress; with 7lb claimer recruited and the stable running three, he needs a 📊 market check.
Horse quote: 2024-07-24 at Lingfield (AW) (13f): "It was a slow pace and I was held hostage to that slow running of the race. At halfway I was locked away and I had a look up and Callum was getting a freebie. It's always worrying when you see that but luckily I was able to get myself out of that position. Small Fry seemed more comfortable today and the step up in trip seemed to help - Tom Queally, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Three starts last summer, the clear pick when third at Southwell (1m3f, AW); put in his place by the winner in another novice there (1m4f; beat the rest) after a six-month break and he weakened into ninth of ten to Arqoob on handicap debut at Kempton (1m4f, AW; 11-2) latest, so he has plenty to prove as well as being the most lightly raced.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last season went poorly; 13lb below peak mark but this short a trip asks a big question
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Group 3 winner (2m/1m7f) for other yards in 2023; he didn't beat many last February-October, including in four races for current yard, and although he's not been sent to the Middle East to start this campaign and is now 13lb below his peak mark, this short a trip asks a big question.
Horse quote: 2023-05-25 at Sandown (16f): "Roberto Escobarr was off for a lot of last year. We brought him back this year hoping he would qualify for All-Weather Finals Day but he was just a little bit rusty in that race and he finished third. We have just been waiting for this quicker ground. He wants good, good to firm ground and he is slightly unexposed over the two miles. It is lovely for him to win his Group race. His brother Pablo Escobarr won his Group race as well. We are delighted. He is as genuine as anything and Richard (Kingscote) said he was relaxed in front and was very comfortable travelling around there and he has stuck his head down and fought to the line which is fantastic. We hadn't really discussed any further than today. We are slightly ground dependent. We will get him out of this and I will have a chat with William (Haggas, trainer) and Mr Lootah and we will make a plan - Richard Knight, representing the winning owner Hussain Alabbas Lootah."
