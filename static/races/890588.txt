🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well on both outings since 3m1f Hereford win in November; the one with least to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Built upon promising chase debut when winning by 11l at Hereford (3m1f, good to soft) in December and both runs since the turn of the year were perfectly respectable; should be fine on today's faster ground and last month's wind op could plausibly enable improvement; ought to be a tough nut to crack.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Disappointed last month, after a break, but made excellent start to chase career in autumn
🔦 Spotlight: Made excellent start to chase/handicap career in the autumn, winning at Worcester (2m7f, soft) and Ascot (3m, good) before good third at Taunton (2m7f, good); disappointed when back in action last month but has good chance here if he rebounds.
Horse quote: 2024-10-16 at Worcester (23f): "I said Law Of Supply would never do anything until he goes over fences. And he's won really impressively today. He is a nice horse - Kim Bailey, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over hurdles in new headgear in January but in poor form since
🔦 Spotlight: Seemingly boosted by change of headgear when emphatic winner over hurdles at Fakenham (2m4f, good to soft; first-time visor) on New Year's Day, but subsequent hurdling form has been very disappointing; reverts to chasing on a workable mark but with quite a bit to prove, including stamina.
Horse quote: 2025-01-01 at Fakenham (20f): "After Pearly Island ran over fences at Doncaster last time I suggested a try back over hurdles. It's nice to get it right sometimes - Tom Cannon, jockey."
