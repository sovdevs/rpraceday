🔦 Spotlight: Course winner (5f); series of good handicap runs, including when second to a well-treated opponent at Southwell eight days ago (well backed); looked a bit rusty there after a layoff and connections now reach for headgear; 🔥 big player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled badly since handicapping; could yet fulfl early promise but there are risks
🔦 Spotlight: Won two AW novices in his first three starts; badly out of sorts since handicapping though, including back on the AW and dropped to 6f at Chelmsford in October (attracted support); the blinkers tried there are now absent; still early days but there are risks involved.
