🔦 Spotlight: Didn't go on from an eyecatching Flat debut here in December, but yet to race beyond 5f in this discipline and 1m looks far closer to optimum on pedigree; possible big 🚀 improver, especially if the tongue tie helps.

🔦 Spotlight: Classified successes over this C&D and (latest) Wolverhampton's 8.6f either side of a narrow defeat by Quick Away in the same grade; that most recent win constituted career-best form, offering hope a record of 4443 in handicaps could be at least improved upon.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Chance on form level of October's C&D fifth; often not lasting home over further since.
🔦 Spotlight: Enters calculations on such as last October's C&D fifth off 10lb higher, and hopes lie in part with the return to 1m after failing to last under forcing tactics on many starts since; headgear comes off.

💬 Comment: Likely to have needed recent return over 7f here; back below last winning mark again.
🔦 Spotlight: Couldn't get competitive here on this month's return from 400 days off, albeit over a 7f that may no longer be any use to him; 2lb drop takes him below the mark from which he completed his Tapeta hat-trick two years ago, and he's 1-1 over C&D; revival not impossible.

🔦 Spotlight: Fair start for this yard at Lingfield last month (7f), on which evidence a return to 1m makes sense; well below that effort since, however, and always the fear with him that the tendency to hang left will resurface.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner but best 2025 form so far has been elsewhere; last won a handicap in 2022.
🔦 Spotlight: Two wins (0-65 and classified) to show from eight C&D starts, but has offered too little back here either side of March's Newcastle classified success and it's three years now since her most recent handicap score.
Horse quote: 2022-04-24 at Wetherby (8f): "Joanna (Mason) said that Copper Mountain got stuck in the mud at Redcar. She also said that, like every horse, they've got to want to win and she does want to win. She might go for a mile-and-two race now, there's a race for her at Beverley in a couple of weeks - David Easterby, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Inconclusive first turf run latest; couple of below-par efforts over this C&D before that.
🔦 Spotlight: Inconclusive first turf run latest (stumbled early, then short of room); couple of below-par efforts over this C&D immediately before that, and others carry greater momentum into the race.
Horse quote: 2024-02-14 at Dundalk (AW) (7f): "Although Beautiful Dawn was coming back in trip, I thought we went a good and even pace and it was playing into my hands well. My horse stays very well and she's tough. She picked up nicely and I felt I put the race to bed but the boys were always breathing down my neck. We're sharing the spoils with Jamie but I'm delighted to get another win beside her name - Dylan Browne McMonagle, jockey."
