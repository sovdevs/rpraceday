🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up on return from wind surgery at Taunton (2m2f, soft) in February; unappealing.
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner (3m, soft to heavy) who has achieved little under rules; pulled up on return from wind surgery at Taunton (2m2f, soft; 22-1, second run over fences) in February; headgear tweaked once more as she seeks to rediscover a basic spark; unappealing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ready winner at Doncaster (3m2f, good) 18 days ago; 9lb higher but still the one to beat.
🔦 Spotlight: Always to the fore and readily off the mark at Doncaster (3m2f, good) 18 days ago; now 9lb higher, but is worthy of such a rise given the level of improvement that she's shown switched to fences; likely to take plenty of pegging back around here; rates as the one to beat.
