🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Competitive in handicaps last autumn; 5yo back from a break with potential for more
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper and maiden hurdle winner on good ground; has done well in handicaps, narrowly beaten at Navan (2m) and only faded late on when third over 2m4f at Fairyhouse in November when cheekpieces tried; 5yo back from a break with potential for more and slightly shorter trip to suit.
Horse quote: 2024-10-04 at Gowran Park (16f): "Tonaghneave Well had the experience. I dropped my stick going to the last and he was having a good look so thankfully I held on. He was being a little bit lairy but experience probably won it for him - Keith Donoghue, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Return to this trip to suit on handicap debut and potential remains
🔦 Spotlight: Point-to-point winner for Derek O'Connor last season; winning rules debut in 2m Navan maiden hurdle in December and chased home clear-cut winners both starts since when favourite in novice events, drop back to 2m at Naas on latest didn't really suit; back up in trip for handicap debut with potential for more.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent Navan comeback run very encouraging; likely major player off a nice mark
🔦 Spotlight: Three-time hurdles winner at around 2m; very encouraging comeback run at Navan last month when staying on third behind a revitalised rival (won again since) over 2m4f (heavy); better ground to suit and likely major player off a nice mark.
Horse quote: 2021-02-28 at Naas (15.5f): "Zoffanien has run into one or two but did it well today. He had to, if he's going to Cheltenham he would have to have done that well today. Hopefully he will get there in one piece - Denis Hogan, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sign of return to form at Limerick 10 days ago; drop in trip may not suit though
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m4f handicap here last season in testing conditions and took his form to new heights last summer on good ground, runner-up at Punchestown handicap before going one better at Roscommon (2m5f); encouraging run on second start back when getting similar ground at Limerick 10 days ago, staying on late into fourth; drop in trip may not be in his favour here.
Horse quote: 2024-06-10 at Roscommon (20.5f): "West Away got a very good ride from Dylan and it was good to reward him. He has developed into a good horse. He had been running in good quality races for the grade so it was great to win one. He could go to Cartmel for a big pot - John McConnell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 3 novice winner here in December; out of depth latest but respected back in handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Much improved this season, winning handicaps at Kilbeggan and Listowel before career-best in winning 3m Grade 3 novice here in December (soft); never landed a blow upped to Grade 1 company at DRF but respected back in handicap company here, although trip on the short side.
Horse quote: 2024-12-08 at Cork (24.5f): "Pray Tell is a good horse and he has such a heart. He has been plagued with injuries but the last two years have been good. We have in him now since January and he could do with a few weeks on grass - Des Kenneally, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-12-29 at Leopardstown (20f): "The Enabler was good there today and just got a bit close to the last. I'm not sure what his trip is as he wasn't getting home over three miles and two miles looked too short, but he got the job done and that's all that matters for now - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Promise in maiden hurdles last season and off the mark when bolting up in 2m Fairyhouse opportunity handicap in January on soft; disappointing favourite following month in similar Naas contest, reluctant to post and fading quite tamely; upped in trip here.
Horse quote: 2025-01-25 at Fairyhouse (16f): "Well Dressed faded at Navan the last day, she didn't get home. We dropped her back to 2m and it looked a winnable opportunity. Cian rides out for us and has a nice pair of hands. She's not in at Leopardstown next week - Eddie Harty, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well below best the last twice but on an okay mark on previous efforts
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner for Declan Queally at up to 2m6f; solid efforts in defeat twice over hurdles for her current trainer but disappointing the last twice, let down by jumping at Naas on latest; just 2lb above last winning mark so don't rule out.
Horse quote: 2023-07-14 at Cork (20f): "Natural Look was in season last time. She worked really well last week and we knew what scope for improvement there was with her. She was deadly to jump today - Declan Queally, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle win came here (2m1f) and most of racing since has been over fences, disappointing of late in handicaps; reverts to hurdles here with something to prove.
Horse quote: 2022-12-11 at Cork (17f): "I don't think we need to rush and there is the Grade 2 Moscow Flyer Hurdle at Punchestown in the middle of January and that might be the race for Arctic Bresil. He has a lot of pace so we will stick to two miles - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not an obvious one dropped in trip but don't rule out
🔦 Spotlight: Back to his best to land 23-runner 2m6f Navan handicap hurdle (yielding) in November; failed to back that up twice since however, latest in similar Thurles contest last month, following a short break; not an obvious one dropped in trip but don't rule out.
Horse quote: 2024-11-17 at Navan (22.5f): "Sequoiaspirit is a cracking little horse. I was a bit worried about the step up in trip with the ground going, but he saw it out well. We always thought there was a nice race in him over hurdles, but it takes time to get to know him. Liam knows him well now. He's only a small horse and you would think that it would be mad going down the inside with him but he thrives on that sort of thing - Ray Hackett, trainer."
