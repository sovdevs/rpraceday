💬 Comment: Appealing on pedigree and represents yard with a fine strike-rate in bumpers this term
🔦 Spotlight: 105,000euros 3yo; second foal; half-brother to French 2m1f hurdle winner Luciano Montorio; dam unplaced 2m1f-2m2f hurdles/chases, half-sister to two useful French winners; cost a six-figure sum, makes some appeal on pedigree and represents a yard with a 28% strike-rate in bumpers this term.
