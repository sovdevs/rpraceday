🔦 Spotlight: Came good when scoring here (2m, good to firm) and at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) in November; disappointing in hat-trick bid in December but he's had another wind op since and looks worth another try at this trip; needs watching in market on return.

🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French 4yo; record of 0-7 but he's been placed in the last three of his four runs for current yard including when runner-up at Stratford (2m2f, good to soft) last month; untried on quicker than good to soft but he still has potential and needs a close look on handicap debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Won four times in Jersey last year (twice over hurdles) and he landed a Bath handicap (1m6f, good to firm) on his return 19 days ago; that was his 17th career win and he's respected back over hurdles.
Horse quote: 2020-07-17 at Chepstow (7f): "Man Of The Sea won well. Mr Mulholland said before the race he was in great form. He was a bit outpaced the last day at Windsor but he stays all day. He pinged the gates, I kept hold of him and he ran all the way to the line - George Rooke, rider."

💬 Comment: Still lightly raced but needs to raise his game back up in trip; cheekpieces added
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice against own age-group last season but he's not made a serious impact in four handicaps and was beaten 22l at Exeter (2m, good) last month; still lightly raced but needs to raise his game back up in trip; cheekpieces added.
Horse quote: 2023-12-21 at Exeter (16.5f): "With three inexperienced horses it turned into a sprint up the straight but he showed a willing attitude in fighting off the second. Valadon is a tall, scopey individual who's more of a galloper and very much in the National Hunt mould - Harry Fry, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Runner-up at Plumpton (2m, good) and he could go well again back up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m maiden at Fakenham in May 2022; off for long time after but he's run some good races in the last 15 months including when runner-up at Plumpton (2m, good) 17 days ago; this step back up in trip is no problem and he could go well again.

🔦 Spotlight: Won novice hurdle at Hereford (extended 2m, good) in November but he's been generally disappointing in handicaps since and was always behind at Ffos Las (2m4f, good to soft) last time; overall record is now 1-17 and others are preferred.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole hurdle win was in 2019 and he has lots to prove after another break
🔦 Spotlight: Sole hurdle win was in 2019 and he's struggled over fences and hurdles in three runs after a long absence; mark is tumbling but he has plenty to prove after another break.
Horse quote: 2019-08-18 at Tramore (16f): "Blackhillsofdakota was having his third run in 18 days at Aintree last season so we learned a lesson there. We'll take our time with him and go the novice hurdle route. A more galloping track will suit - Josh Halley, assistant"
