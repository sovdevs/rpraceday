🔦 Spotlight: Wins last year came first time out in Ireland, and on AW debut (having been ✂️ gelded) for Rossa Ryan; the break looks in his favour in that case for a trainer who's 3-13 with 3yos here; interesting to see how he goes in the market.

💬 Comment: Best judged on her closing nursery third off 2lb higher; will need to improve on that
🔦 Spotlight: Last May's C&D maiden win didn't amount to much and she's better judged on her closing nursery third at Musselburgh (good to firm) off 2lb higher than today (pulled hard over 6f in between); she'll need to improve on that after nine months off.
