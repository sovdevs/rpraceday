🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well held on last month's Southwell return but he probably needed it; may fare better
🔦 Spotlight: Dual Tapeta winner over 1m4f including here; finished behind two of these on last month's Southwell return (16.5f, Tapeta), but his record after a break of four months or more suggests he would have needed it; may fare better.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten in three starts over shorter on turf in Ireland last summer; watch market
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten in three starts over 7f-9.5f on turf in Ireland last summer; makes his handicap/AW debut after seven months off and although nothing in his pedigree to suggest this big step up in trip will suit, is still well worth monitoring in the market.
