🔦 Spotlight: Dual 1m4f winner for Richard Hannon as a 3yo (good to firm and good) who was picked up for 40,000gns last summer; often made the running on the Flat and a return to more aggressive tactics could help back on a sounder surface now handicapping.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't offered a lot in three runs over hurdles; want to see some support now handicapping
🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame in three Irish points but hasn't offered a lot in three runs over hurdles, all on soft going; whether today's forecast faster ground will work in his favour remains to be seen and would want to see some support now handicapping.
