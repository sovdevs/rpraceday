🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Low-mileage 6yo, never out of first two; close second last time; high on the list
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 6yo, never out of the first two; already much better over fences than hurdles and followed wins at Chepstow and over C&D (good to soft; made most of running) with narrow defeat back at Chepstow last time; creeping up the weights but thriving and high on the list again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won last two races at Huntingdon and Kempton; commands respect in hat-trick bid
🔦 Spotlight: 2-19 over hurdles; has taken well to chasing, winning five-runner races at Huntingdon (2m, good to soft) and Kempton (2m2f, good); in front when left clear before last fence on latest start; will need another personal best to complete a hat-trick but he clearly commands respect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't progressed as expected but last run was more encouraging and his mark has tumbled
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced for his age; won on chase debut at Chepstow (2m, good) in October 2022; hasn't progressed as expected but his mark has tumbled and he shaped with a bit more encouragement when third of five to a stablemate over C&D three weeks ago; real possibilities if building on that.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In-and-out form in Britain; needs to put everything together but new headgear could help
🔦 Spotlight: In and out since coming to Britain from France, but he shaped quite well when fifth of nine over C&D in November (good to soft; Beau Balko second) and he's now 7lb lower; shaped better than the bare result (made a bad mistake) when fourth of seven at Stratford 12 days ago; needs to put everything together but first-time cheekpieces and a returning tongue-strap could help.
