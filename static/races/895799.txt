🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Misbehaved at the start on turf debut at Limerick, promising third in the circumstances
🔦 Spotlight: Got the hang of things late when fourth in a 7f Dundalk maiden on debut; unplaced behind the smart Purview on second start; misbehaved at the start on turf debut at Limerick, promising third in the circumstances, staying on behind two rivals in the mid-80s; only 3yo in the race, may prove too goo for his elders.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ground was very soft for last month's win but his best form has been mostly on AW or good
🔦 Spotlight: Ground was very soft for last month's win at Limerick; however, but his best form has been mostly on AW or good, and he has definite prospects off his revised mark.
Horse quote: 2025-04-25 at Limerick (8f): "Chavajod is the only horse we have so we have only one shot at it and I ride him out on his own everyday. Anytime he's run on soft ground before he's been tailed off but he handled it here. We might go back to Killarney with him in the summer - Denis Coakley, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."
