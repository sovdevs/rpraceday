🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Did well as a 2yo; made the frame in Group 1 events the last twice; top on ratings
🔦 Spotlight: Did well as a 2yo, bagging notable prizes (6f/7f) at Ascot and Deauville prior to making the frame in Group 1 contests at the Curragh (second to unbeaten Lake Victoria) and Longchamp; top on ratings.
Horse quote: 2024-08-17 at Deauville (7f): "It was an easier watch than the Princess Margaret. Dylan [Browne McMonagle] said Simmering probably hit the front a bit soon but he didn't have anything else to take him into the race, and she maybe looked a round a bit. I think she will be a better filly on better ground but she seemed to handle it okay here today. This is only my second ever foreign runner and she's my first Group 2 winner so it's nice to have a flagbearer like that in the yard. I think she's still progressive, she's a big filly and it's exciting. Seven furlongs was a new trip today, which she saw it out well. It's her fourth run of the season and I don't think we'll go to the well too many more times this year. She likes the quick ground and we'll give the Breeders' Cup strong consideration - Ollie Sangster, trainer."

💬 Comment: Rockfel third; something to find on ratings and needs to have done well over the winter
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable third in the Rockfel on final 2yo start, albeit failed to show further progress and perhaps that's the ceiling of her ability; something to find on ratings and needs to have done well over the winter.
Horse quote: 2024-08-12 at Ayr (7f): "Duty First certainly looks capable of black type and we'll need to open up the programme book and see what's available. We fancied her going to Newmarket and she ran a nice race there in what I suspect is a pretty good maiden, and we definitely liked her chances here. She should have a bright future and hopefully she can live up to some of those entries. We'll see how she is coming back and make a plan - Oliver St Lawrence, owners' racing manager."

💬 Comment: Has Group form but is 0-6 since debut win; not sure to improve much this year
🔦 Spotlight: Northern filly whose 2024 campaign featured good efforts in Group sprints at Royal Ascot and Ayr; however, 0-6 since debut win and doesn't look an obvious type to improve much from two to three.
Horse quote: 2024-06-19 at Ascot (5f): "I'm delighted. Obviously Maw Lam was very unlucky the last day. They went fast, Hollie said, and she finished strong, so to get black type in the Queen Mary is brilliant. We'll see what the team want to do - hopefully go for a Listed race, then onwards to better things, hopefully. She's very, very relaxed. She likes the attention. She was asleep 20 minutes before the girls went to put the bridle on her, which stands her in good stead, so hopefully now maybe France, there's a race in Ireland. Let her stop blowing, and then make a decision - Adrian Nicholls, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Only a neck behind Simmering in Ascot Group 3 but failed to back up the form in two subsequent starts, whereas that rival has improved further since; something to prove in this first run beyond 6f.
Horse quote: 2024-05-17 at York (5f): "I bred Betty Clover her and I'm so wildly excited, I just can't believe it. I thought she had a chance of a place and I thought she had a chance of turning the form round with Running Queen, who got first run on us last time. Georgia gave her the most beautiful ride. I'm very proud of my jockey, she doesn't get many chances and bloody hell she's good. She should be saluted for that.   We have to look at Ascot. I don't know which race. It's a very fast five furlongs at York and she travelled all right into it but we'll have a think - Eve Johnson Houghton, trainer."
