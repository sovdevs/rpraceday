🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed point winner; returns from a long absence but his yard are going well
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner in January 2023; ran out the ready winner of a Carlisle novice hurdle on his rules debut in October 2023 and ran to a similar level when second at Chepstow three months later; should make a chaser and he's 🔍 unexposed so he needs a close 📊 market check returning from 445 days off with his yard in form.
