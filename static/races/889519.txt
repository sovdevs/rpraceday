🔦 Spotlight: Enhanced an already-decent record over C&D when second in a handicap not run to suit late last month; had struggled for consistency prior to that, and there's little wiggle room off this mark, but he's still in with a chance.

📝 Comment: in rear, steady headway from 5th, still plenty to do when left in modest third 3 out, went second 2 out, stayed on approaching last, too much to do (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said that his instructions were to drop in and settle, get jumping to finish his race as gelding previously made the running and failed to get home; having jumped the 1st, he felt the front runners had gone too quick and felt it prudent not to chase the strong pace; from after 2nd in back straight he began to niggle and squeeze along having lost ground after being slightly inconvenienced by bold jury running out, and being cautious to the fact they were still a long way from home; turning into home straight he asked for more of an effort, passing tiring horses; he felt that after beau quali had fallen at 3rd last, it had left the winner alone and idling in front, which allowed his gelding to gain more lengths. adding that gelding had achieved best possible placing' he reported to trainer that gelding may benefit from a step up in trip; trainers' rep was satisfied with ride; explanations were noted)
