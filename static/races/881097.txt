🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Grade 1 winner in November and placed behind Galopin Des Champs last twice; good claims
🔦 Spotlight: Shot through the ranks in his novice season over fences, winning two Grade 1s including Brown Advisory (extended 3m, soft) at this meeting; won the John Durkan at Punchestown (extended 2m3f, soft) in November but reputation has taken a slight knock since when beaten twice at around 3m by the outstanding Galopin Des Champs; wise move to duck that rival a third time and holds strong claims back in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Brilliant at Kempton the last two years; the form pick but unproven at Cheltenham
🔦 Spotlight: Has dazzled at Kempton on Boxing Day the last two years, winning a Grade 1 novice and coming so close to landing the King George (good); leads the field on that form and his attacking style usually suits the chase courses around 2m4f at Cheltenham, but he is untested on this more idiosyncratic track and he underachieves in races in his native France.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last year's winner and campaigned around the race this season; rock-solid claims
🔦 Spotlight: Has reinvented himself at around this trip in the last 12 months, starting with a win in this race (soft; beat Envoi Allen 4l) last year; brought to concert pitch for this race again, having won by 23l under an aggressive ride at Windsor (2m6f, soft) in January; rock-solid claims and while most of his form is on soft ground, he was third in the 2022 Gold Cup on good to soft.

💬 Comment: Lightly raced for 11; a wildcard, but last year's Gold Cup 6th is no forlorn hope on form
🔦 Spotlight: Very lightly raced 11yo who has won five of his seven career starts, one of the defeats when 21l sixth in last year's Gold Cup; 8l winner of a graduation chase at Ascot (2m5f, good to soft) in November on his only run this season; something of a wildcard but this front-runner is no forlorn hope.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: High class when the ground is quick but this a big ask on first run since November
🔦 Spotlight: Has been the best chaser around in Britain the last two summers, winning three times from an extended 2m3f to 3m2f; also finished second in the Silver Trophy over C&D (good) last April; up against it on his first run since finishing fourth in the Charlie Hall in early November.
