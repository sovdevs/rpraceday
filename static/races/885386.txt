💬 Comment: Chasing is her optimum discipline but has same mark for recent 5l Windsor win over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Following a long layoff she was a creditable third over hurdles in December on her first two starts for this yard (2m, good to soft), then found considerable improvement to win at Windsor (2m4f, soft) three weeks ago when back up in trip and reverting to fences; chasing is her optimum discipline but she has the same mark as last time and tackles a similar trip; contender.

💬 Comment: In fine form in these cheekpieces on his last three starts and he's a key player
🔦 Spotlight: In fine form in these cheekpieces on his last three starts, winning at Plumpton (2m4f, good) then going close at Wincanton (2m4f, good to soft) and Ascot (2m5f, good to soft); ran well the last time he tackled soft ground; it was a competitive handicap on latest start and he's a key player up 4lb.

💬 Comment: Back-to-form second at Huntingdon recently; shorter trip today but still respected
🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 2 novice hurdle at Cheltenham (3m, soft) in December 2023 and, after failing to shine over fences, he reverted to hurdles in a handicap at Huntingdon (3m1f, soft) a fortnight ago and finished second in first-time cheekpieces; also effective on good to soft; the cheekpieces are left off and the drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he's still respected.

💬 Comment: Only fourth at Aintree when bidding for hat-trick but 7lb claimer Lewis Saunders returns
🔦 Spotlight: Two quickfire wins in November (2m4f/2m3f, good to soft/good) and fair fourth in the fog at Aintree (2m4f, soft) in December; not necessarily handicapped out of things and Lewis Saunders, who was on board for his last two wins, is back in the saddle today to remove 7lb; chance.

💬 Comment: In a deeper race today but this lightly raced 6yo has won 3 of his last 4 hurdle starts
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row at Plumpton (2m4f, soft) early last year and, following a run on the Flat, he returned to form with a win in a first-time visor (retained) at Fontwell (2m3f, soft) in October; absent since and this is a deeper race, but this lightly raced 6yo could continue to improve.

🔦 Spotlight: Following a long layoff she was a creditable third over hurdles in December on her first two starts for this yard (2m, good to soft), then found considerable improvement to win at Windsor (2m4f, soft) three weeks ago when back up in trip and reverting to fences; chasing is her optimum discipline but she has the same mark as last time and tackles a similar trip; contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 2 novice hurdle at Cheltenham (3m, soft) in December 2023 and, after failing to shine over fences, he reverted to hurdles in a handicap at Huntingdon (3m1f, soft) a fortnight ago and finished second in first-time cheekpieces; also effective on good to soft; the cheekpieces are left off and the drop back in trip isn't an obvious plus, but he's still respected.

💬 Comment: Only fourth at Aintree when bidding for hat-trick but 7lb claimer Lewis Saunders returns
🔦 Spotlight: Two quickfire wins in November (2m4f/2m3f, good to soft/good) and fair fourth in the fog at Aintree (2m4f, soft) in December; not necessarily handicapped out of things and Lewis Saunders, who was on board for his last two wins, is back in the saddle today to remove 7lb; chance.

💬 Comment: In a deeper race today but this lightly raced 6yo has won 3 of his last 4 hurdle starts
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row at Plumpton (2m4f, soft) early last year and, following a run on the Flat, he returned to form with a win in a first-time visor (retained) at Fontwell (2m3f, soft) in October; absent since and this is a deeper race, but this lightly raced 6yo could continue to improve.
