🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten on last 15 starts but runner-up on two of his last four; could be thereabouts
🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who has been beaten 15 times since his last win last July but runner-up on two of his last four starts, most recently off this mark at Brighton (1m, good to firm) 12 days ago; could be thereabouts once more.
Horse quote: 2019-05-14 at Chepstow (8f): "Light Up Our Stars ran a grand race at Newbury on his seasonal comeback on very soft ground and the quick conditions here have helped him. We will have to see how the handicapper looks at the result before making a little plan - Richard Hughes, trainer."
