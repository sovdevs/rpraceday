🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shock Ballysax winner didn't stay in Derby; runs well fresh, 🔥 big player if handling AW
🔦 Spotlight: Returned much improved to create upset in falsely-run Group 3 Ballysax stakes at Leopardstown in April of last year (1m2f, heavy); sweating, didn't see out the Derby trip at Epsom in early June and hasn't been seen since; seasonal return and a likely danger to all, given he runs well fresh, providing he handles this surface.

🔦 Spotlight: All five runs have been here, scoring three times including 1m4f rated race last month and 2m handicap three weeks ago; forward runner could be the pace angle here but fair bit to find with stablemate Dallas Star on ratings and drop in trip not in his favour.
