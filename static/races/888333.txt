🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Given a lot to do before running on well for clear second on h'cap debut; still 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 6yo who won a Hexham maiden in the autumn and ended up with a lot to do before running on well for a clear second on last month's handicap debut at Wetherby (2m3f, soft); has to take a recent 5lb rise on the chin but probably still has a bigger run in her.

💬 Comment: Twice in the frame since disappointing handicap debut; back up in trip here; 3lb wrong
🔦 Spotlight: Disappointed on handicap debut in November but has made the frame twice since (2m2f/2m1f); needs to find something extra to land this prize from 3lb out of the weights but might have untapped potential over 2m4f.
