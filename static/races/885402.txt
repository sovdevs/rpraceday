🔦 Spotlight: Made it 2-6 over hurdles when defying a penalty to win a novice at Bangor (2m, soft) in December; carries a double penalty today and probably needs another step forward, but that's possible; the hood that was left off last time, and in which his other win came, goes back on here.

🔦 Spotlight: Easily won an Irish maiden point (3m, good to yielding) in December on his fourth start; with a top trainer and it's very early days under rules, but he failed to threaten on his recent hurdle debut at Doncaster (2m, good to soft) and considerable improvement is needed this afternoon.

💬 Comment: Fair third at 125-1 here last time but has work to do with As The Fella Says on that form
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two bumpers (yielding/good to soft) and fair third at 125-1 here (2m, soft) last month on her second hurdle start; however, she was nearly 9l behind runner-up As The Fella Says that day so has work to do.
