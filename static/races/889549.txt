🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🚀 improver who has form figures of 12211 since in November; strong contender
🔦 Spotlight: Has form figures of 12211 since returning from a break in November and she completed a Chelmsford double (1m2f) in good style last time; up another 4lb but she still looks feasibly treated and is open to more progress back on Tapeta; strong claims.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five wins on AW in September-January; held in last three starts but she's not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Won times on AW (9.4f-1m4f) in September-January; held on Tapeta in last three starts but she had some traffic issues at Southwell last time and was beaten less than 2l over C&D on penultimate run; probably still not handicapped out of things and could be a dangerous if she gets a decent pace.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 for Peter Chapple-Hyam and was last of seven on stable debut at Newcastle (1m2f) last month, but she travelled well for a long way and may have needed the run; continues to drop down the weights and she's one to keep an eye on back in trip.
