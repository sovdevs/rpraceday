💬 Comment: 7yo who is 2-5 over fences and he's open to more progress back up in trip; key player
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 7yo, who made it 2-5 over fences when finishing well to land a Leicester handicap (2m7f, heavy) in February; that was a narrow success but a 3lb rise looks fair and he's open to more progress back up in trip; strongly respected.

🔦 Spotlight: His last chase win was two years ago and he failed to complete in two of his last three starts but he split those two runs with a near-miss over fences at Exeter (3m, good) last month; only 2lb higher here and he's a 🔥 big player if he can recapture that form.

💬 Comment: Last year's winner and has claims if he can bounce back after a tame effort at Southwell
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who has won three times over fences including on good ground in this race last year; couldn't hang in there at Southwell last Tuesday but that was after three placed efforts in a row and he has possibilities if he can get back near best.
Horse quote: 2023-05-23 at Huntingdon (20f): "Cloudy Wednesday likes this ground and it's done nothing but rain until now. He's had a busy time so I might give him a break after that - Caroline Fryer, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On workable mark but he's not easy to predict and still has stamina to prove at this trip
🔦 Spotlight: Only 1lb higher than for his Worcester win (2m4f, good; first-time cheekpieces) last June but has mixed record since and was well held on Fontwell reappearance last month; may have needed that run but he still has stamina to prove at this trip and others are preferred.
Horse quote: 2024-03-25 at Huntingdon (20f): "The drying ground is the important thing. We may step Calvic up in trip on the back at that, especially on that ground - Stuart Edmunds, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-23 over fences and his only hurdle win was in 2019; opposable from out of weights
🔦 Spotlight: Bounced back with a respectable fourth of six at Sedgefield (3m2f, good) last time but that took his chase record to 0-23 and his only hurdle win was in 2019; opposable from out of the weights.
