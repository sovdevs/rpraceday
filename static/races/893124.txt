🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No win since 2021; hopes rest on the return to turf and removal of blinkers perking him up
🔦 Spotlight: Still to add to his 2yo novice success; patchy record since returning from a long absence last autumn; dangerous mark but hopes rest on the return to turf and removal of blinkers giving him a lift.
Horse quote: 2021-06-11 at Sandown (5f): "We always thought a lot of Mojomaker and there was a reason we took him to the Lily Agnes first time out at Chester as we thought he was good enough to win there. He didn't handle the track on the day but he left that well and truly behind at Goodwood last time. I think he should have won but he threw the race away. He can hang a bit and be a bit of a lad but we put a new bit on his bridle today and it has worked a treat. Pat (Cosgrave, jockey) got off him at Goodwood and said he would love to run him over five furlongs at Sandown. We were very bullish coming down. There is a Listed race back here next month and we will probably look at something like that ahead of the Molecomb at Goodwood - David Loughnane, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well over C&D after a break last April; new headgear tried; career best required
🔦 Spotlight: Several good runs last year, including C&D, before winning at Ripon in August off a 3lb lower mark; ended last season quietly, though, and he returns to action in a change of headgear.
Horse quote: 2024-08-27 at Ripon (6f): "Wreck It Ryley has done it well. I was just waiting for the gap to appear. He's run in blinkers a few times before and they do help him because he's a bit behind the bridle normally. He keeps breaking half a stride too slowly, but he's soon there on the heels of the leaders and he was there when I needed him. I had plenty of horse underneath me to commit and go - Dale Swift, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
