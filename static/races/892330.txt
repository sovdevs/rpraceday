üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: No show at big prices in three maidens, upped in trip for h'cap bow, may need more time
üî¶ Spotlight: Triple figure odds and never figured in a trio of maidens at 7f-8f on good-good to yielding; related to winners so could improve upped in trip on handicap debut but she may need more time.
