🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy win in a 1m classified event here 12 days ago; solid claims in another weak race
🔦 Spotlight: He had been threatening prior to recording a stylish success at this level here 12 days ago (1m); that was his first win for two years but he looks to have been found a good opportunity to follow up with a well-run 7f unlikely to pose a problem.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6f win at Southwell this month; solid run in a Class 5 h'cap latest; 🔥 big player up to 7f
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the tenth attempt when landing a 6f handicap at Southwell on March 1; creditable third here last time in a Class 5 handicap; needs to settle to see out 7f but this is a drop in grade and she's high on the list; Oisin Orr replaces a 7lb claimer.

💬 Comment: 0-13 last year but down in grade for his return; usual headgear absent; betting to guide
🔦 Spotlight: 0-13 in 2024 but he ran some good races and has dropped 10lb in the weights; that makes him eligible for a first dip into the murky waters of 0-50 classified company and he needs a 📊 market check back from an absence; usual headgear absent.
