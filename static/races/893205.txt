🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Form of latest effort has been franked by the first two since; open to progress
🔦 Spotlight: Record is 2-4; turned over at short odds at Haydock in December when last seen (had wind surgery since) but it was by no means a bad effort in hindsight, with the first two franking the form subsequently; open to progress in handicaps.
Horse quote: 2024-12-01 at Leicester (15.5f): "That was ideal. Indeevar Bleu is a beautiful one to look forward to if I can keep him trainable. Hopefully he's okay in the morning and it's just a case of slowly, slowly with him. We'll go small again now in three/four weeks time, he's very raw still  but he's got a lot of ability. Olly Murphy, trainer talking to Racing TV."

💬 Comment: Drops in grade but is the sole veteran in the field and faces some 🔍 unexposed types
🔦 Spotlight: Completed a Class 3 double at Fontwell (2m3f/2m1f; both on good to soft) in the autumn following a long absence but mixed results since; drops in grade off a workable mark but is the sole veteran in the field and faces some 🔍 unexposed types.
Horse quote: 2024-09-08 at Fontwell (19f): "Stream Of Stars had a long time off and the owners have been very patient, because I promise you we've probably given him eight entries and he's never once been declared. There's been a lot of patience shown all round and it's paid off. He had a leg, and then recovered from that and was just coming back into training at possibly the wrong time. I thought stepping up to two miles and three on his first run back possibly wasn't ideal but luckily he got a nice slot in behind the leader and it was a nice even pace. He relaxed and jumped - Sam Twiston-Davies, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Failed to turn things around in sole run for new stable; best watched
🔦 Spotlight: Eventually regressed for Paul Nicholls and failed to turn things around in sole run for new stable; on a three-year losing spell and returns from another break; best watched.
Horse quote: 2021-11-04 at Newbury (16.5f): "Silent Revolution is a nice horse who has improved over the summer and I think they think a lot of the second. I think we'll go for a race with a penalty and he'll be a nice chaser, while he would get two and a half miles, but he might be one for the Kennel Gate at Ascot in December. He didn't mind that ground - it's absolutely superb ground - Paul Nicholls, trainer."
