💬 Comment: Could easily defy another 6lb rise with new track and return to further both likely okay
🔦 Spotlight: Won three of his last four starts over 6f at different venues; shrugged off a 6lb rise last time and bids to do so again returned to further here (unlikely to be an issue); course debut.

💬 Comment: Dominating this field from the widest stall won't be easy
🔦 Spotlight: Matched his personal best when readily making all over 1m at Lingfield just before Christmas; probably did too much out in front when fading into fourth over this trip at Wolverhampton last time; dominating this field from the widest stall won't be easy.

🔦 Spotlight: First runner in Lemos De Souza's name; best form at Chelmsford and her second there last October off a 140-day break was a fine effort; bitterly disappointing elsewhere since and tries another new track this afternoon; more severe headgear is reached for (blinkers replace cheekpieces).

💬 Comment: 🆕 new yard likely to find the key to him but Cut To The Chase looks their main hope in this
🔦 Spotlight: Stop-start career but has joined a yard (formerly with Edward Smyth-Osbourne) that does so well with bargain purchases, this 5yo having been picked up for 1,600gns four weeks ago; he could be one for another day, though, given that hat-trick seeker Cut To The Chase looks their main hope; the tongue-tie/blinkers of recent starts are absent.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Considered if market vibes are more positive on second start for Karl Burke
🔦 Spotlight: Peak RPR of 70 from her six UAE starts; drifted to 33-1 when starting out for Karl Burke at Newcastle last month off a 319-day break but didn't run badly; considered if market vibes are more positive.

🔦 Spotlight: First runner in Lemos De Souza's name; best form at Chelmsford and her second there last October off a 140-day break was a fine effort; bitterly disappointing elsewhere since and tries another new track this afternoon; more severe headgear is reached for (blinkers replace cheekpieces).

💬 Comment: 🆕 new yard likely to find the key to him but Cut To The Chase looks their main hope in this
🔦 Spotlight: Stop-start career but has joined a yard (formerly with Edward Smyth-Osbourne) that does so well with bargain purchases, this 5yo having been picked up for 1,600gns four weeks ago; he could be one for another day, though, given that hat-trick seeker Cut To The Chase looks their main hope; the tongue-tie/blinkers of recent starts are absent.

🔦 Spotlight: Stop-start career but has joined a yard (formerly with Edward Smyth-Osbourne) that does so well with bargain purchases, this 5yo having been picked up for 1,600gns four weeks ago; he could be one for another day, though, given that hat-trick seeker Cut To The Chase looks their main hope; the tongue-tie/blinkers of recent starts are absent.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In the doldrums and C&D fifth 19 days ago wasn't enough of a revival
🔦 Spotlight: Sprang 66-1 surprise at Newcastle in November 2023; in the doldrums since and although running okay over C&D 19 days ago, he finished behind Turbo Command.

💬 Comment: Dominating this field from the widest stall won't be easy
🔦 Spotlight: Matched his personal best when readily making all over 1m at Lingfield just before Christmas; probably did too much out in front when fading into fourth over this trip at Wolverhampton last time; dominating this field from the widest stall won't be easy.

🔦 Spotlight: Won three of his last four starts over 6f at different venues; shrugged off a 6lb rise last time and bids to do so again returned to further here (unlikely to be an issue); course debut.

💬 Comment: 🆕 new yard likely to find the key to him but Cut To The Chase looks their main hope in this
🔦 Spotlight: Stop-start career but has joined a yard (formerly with Edward Smyth-Osbourne) that does so well with bargain purchases, this 5yo having been picked up for 1,600gns four weeks ago; he could be one for another day, though, given that hat-trick seeker Cut To The Chase looks their main hope; the tongue-tie/blinkers of recent starts are absent.

🔦 Spotlight: First runner in Lemos De Souza's name; best form at Chelmsford and her second there last October off a 140-day break was a fine effort; bitterly disappointing elsewhere since and tries another new track this afternoon; more severe headgear is reached for (blinkers replace cheekpieces).
