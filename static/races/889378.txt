💬 Comment: Made it 2-2 for yard with something to spare at Southwell; 7lb penalty may not stop him
🔦 Spotlight: Won on stable debut at Southwell (2m, good to soft) on March 3 and followed up there 11 days ago (2m, good to soft); had nearly 5l to spare last time and a 7lb penalty may not stop this thriving 8yo.

💬 Comment: Won at Newcastle last time and it was a decent race, despite the numbers; up just 2lb
🔦 Spotlight: Versatile in terms of trip and posted a close third at Musselburgh last month (2m7f, good to soft; strong form for the grade) before winning a three-runner handicap at Newcastle (2m, good) a fortnight ago; it was a decent race last time, despite the numbers, and he's just 2lb higher here.

💬 Comment: Unplaced on recent handicap hurdle debut but could improve for the change of disciplines
🔦 Spotlight: Sixth of seven, beaten about 7l, on recent handicap hurdle debut at Taunton (2m, good) and he could do with settling better; however, in-form stable wastes little time in sending this lightly raced 7yo over fences and he could improve for the chance of disciplines; possible player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Something to prove over fences but has had wind op since last time and is lightly raced
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on chase debut at Southwell in October and had a bit of work to do when falling three out at Newcastle later that month; however, she's had wind surgery since and this lightly raced 6yo could be in the mix if rediscovering the form shown over hurdles last spring; not discounted.
