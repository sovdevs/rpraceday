🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second and a slightly below-par 4th in the last 2 runnings; solid chance on best form
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in the 2023 running to one who was never beaten over fences, but she wasn't quite on song when a one-paced fourth to Limerick Lace and Dinoblue 12 months ago; lost nothing in defeat after a tight tussle with Dinoblue at Naas (2m, soft) in February and would make them all go if on her game.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four 2m4f wins before turned over twice at short prices; may yet improve further
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of all four starts (at 2m4f on good to soft or slower) between September 2023 and last May, including a Grade 2; has been turned over at short prices in two runs since back from a break, to an 🚀 improver at Huntingdon last time, but she provides fresher blood against the established ones and might well have a say.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Held Dinoblue at bay in this race in 2024; not nearly that standard on last 2 starts
🔦 Spotlight: Had a high old time last season, including when runner-up in a good 3m handicap at Navan and then keeping Dinoblue at bay in this race (soft; equally effective on good to soft); arrives with more to prove than 12 months ago, however, as she's not reached nearly that standard on her last two runs, and a remote second to Allegorie De Vassy at Fairyhouse in January was the best she could do; some queries for now with cheekpieces fitted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had a great spell when first chasing; good effort on most recent 2m4f run; this is harder
🔦 Spotlight: Finished a close sixth in the mares' novice hurdle at this meeting in 2023; had a charmed spell in her early days over fences, winning all four starts (at up to 2m4f) between late September and November (on ground ranging from soft to good) and did well in the face of a stiff task on her most recent 2m4f run, in a Grade 1 at Fairyhouse; will be suited by the return to this trip but needs improvement and perhaps others will see it out better.

🔦 Spotlight: Just two runs on this track, latest when pulled up in the Kim Muir in 2023; never better than when a wide-margin winner at Haydock (3m1f, soft) in November but she can be a creature of extremes and has been pulled up twice since; up against it at the weights so there's some outperforming to be done; blinkers applied.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Close 2nd in this race last year on rare 2m4f run; in form; major chance
🔦 Spotlight: Has run at the last three Festivals, in the ruck in the mares' novice hurdle then runner-up in the County Hurdle and this race (both on soft; the latter to Limerick Lace); seemed to see out this unfamiliar trip perfectly well last March but has been back at her regular trip of about 2m since and there was precious little between her and Allegorie De Vassy at Naas last month; similar terms today and it can be tight between them again.
