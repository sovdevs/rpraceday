🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd in 2 Punchestown runs either side of Christmas; in better form than most of these
🔦 Spotlight: Has only found one too good in a pair of handicap hurdles at Punchestown either side of Christmas; form of those races isn't particularly strong and up another 1lb but in better form than many of these.

🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive in trio of hurdle starts culminating in a Downpatrick novice handicap hurdle success before low-key chase debut when last seen in November; new trip should suit but has to prove he's as good on slower ground; wears first-time cheekpieces.
