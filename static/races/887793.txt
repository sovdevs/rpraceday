💬 Comment: 2nd in 2 Punchestown runs either side of Christmas; in better form than most of these
🔦 Spotlight: Has only found one too good in a pair of handicap hurdles at Punchestown either side of Christmas; form of those races isn't particularly strong and up another 1lb but in better form than many of these.
