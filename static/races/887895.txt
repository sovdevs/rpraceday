🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Breakthrough came over C&D on 31st start and stable debut, up 10lb but good chance again
🔦 Spotlight: Two creditable efforts in November, in a 1m4f handicap here and a 2m handicap hurdle at Limerick; those runs served as a prelude to a breakthrough win over C&D on 31st start and on stable debut; up 10lb, but good chance again.

🔦 Spotlight: Came back to form over staying trips last summer, winning at Limerick and Clonmel over 2m1f; found 1m4f handicap too sharp here in September; ninth of 14 behind Inchiquin Maid over C&D in December; trip should have suited then; modest Dundalk record (0-15) is a concern.

💬 Comment: Unplaced twice since a respectable middle-distance run here in December, cheekpieces added
🔦 Spotlight: Second in a Navan bumper on debut in 2023; failed to build on that but returned to some sort of form when close up in sixth in a C&D handicap in November and again when third over 1m4f in December; unplaced last twice, cheekpieces tried now.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner in 2021, placed over hurdles last year, Flat form is not persuasive
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner in 2021; has missed plenty of time; produced a bright display when runner-up in a 2m2f handicap hurdle at Cork in August; had an excuse for Roscommon failure and jumped indifferently at Cork two months ago; Flat form is not persuasive, but Colin Keane rides in preference to Mephisto.

🔦 Spotlight: Came back to form over staying trips last summer, winning at Limerick and Clonmel over 2m1f; found 1m4f handicap too sharp here in September; ninth of 14 behind Inchiquin Maid over C&D in December; trip should have suited then; modest Dundalk record (0-15) is a concern.
