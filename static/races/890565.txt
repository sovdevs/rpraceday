🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won this last year and returned to winning ways after a break at Wincanton
🔦 Spotlight: In the same colours but with Anthony Honeyball when a 2l winner of this 12 months ago on good ground; got her career back on track after a break with a successful stable debut at Wincanton (2m4f, good), having comfortably accounted for two rivals; this will take more winning off 6lb higher but clearly a contender.
Horse quote: 2024-04-18 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "That was very good. Somespring Special is better on that ground and I was really pleased with how she travelled and went like a two-miler - at Plumpton she found it all very fast. She was economical over her fences too. It was a bit of a chuckaway entry at first but when she won at Plumpton we thought she had to run. I was shocked by her price, I usually have a good idea what they'll go off, but I thought she'd be much bigger - Anthony Honeyball, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Stays 3m and it was over 2m4f she ran her best race yet over fences when second at Leicester (good to soft); she's not short of pace (effective at 2m as a hurdler) and Harry Skelton is back on board for the first time since they won a maiden hurdle last September.
