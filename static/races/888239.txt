🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed on hurdle debut at Uttoxeter and soft going may not have suited at Sandown since
🔦 Spotlight: Very disappointing favourite in Grade 2 novice at Sandown in December when last seen, but that was his first run on soft ground; this point and bumper winner had previously impressed with a ready win on hurdle debut at Uttoxeter (2m4f, good) and can have a big say if rediscovering that promise.
