🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled hard when disappointing on his Newmarket return, but retains plenty of potential
🔦 Spotlight: Bred in the purple and looked a nice prospect when making a winning debut at Yarmouth (7f, soft) last October (form worked out well), but proved disappointing when beaten 12l into fifth of eight in a Newmarket Listed contest (1m1f, good to soft) last month; needs to settle better than he did there but this triple Group 1 entered colt retains plenty of potential.
Horse quote: 2024-10-15 at Yarmouth (7f): "Sallaal has been a true professional. The only time he wasn't was when they quickened and he couldn't find his legs, but he dealt with it quite well. He showed a bit of class - Jack Mitchell, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Got the better of a 99-rated rival on his Southwell debut; 🚀 open to further improvement
🔦 Spotlight: Sent off a weak 14-1 shot for his Southwell debut (1m, AW) a fortnight ago, but showed a fine attitude to get the better of a 99-rated rival by a neck; there has to be some doubt as to whether his rival ran anywhere near his mark, but it was still a fine effort first time out and he remains 🚀 open to further improvement.
