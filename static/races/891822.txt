🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressive over 9.5f when last seen; fine pedigree but opening mark demands more of her
🔦 Spotlight: Improved for the step up in trip when easily landing a 9.5f fillies' novice at Wolverhampton when last seen in October; bred to be smart but the winning form looks nothing out of the ordinary and the handicapper has taken no chances with her opening mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well in good 7f Listed race on second 2yo run; bred to stay; interesting for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Got up late to win a 7f fillies' maiden at Kempton last June; that form is nothing special but she improved when fifth of ten in a good Listed race at Sandown the following month (7f, good); Sir Michael Stoute's retirement has seen her move to Ralph Beckett; bred to stay at least this far and she's an interesting contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved for 1m and cheekpieces last year; 🔍 unexposed and returns at a realistic level
🔦 Spotlight: Ran poorly on her Newmarket debut last August (7f, good); cheekpieces were immediately reached for and she sprung a 16-1 surprise at Haydock two weeks later (1m, good to soft); better form when second under a penalty at Yarmouth 202 days ago; moves into handicaps with potential.
Horse quote: 2024-09-06 at Haydock (8f): "I still think Bintjeddah was probably a little bit unaware of exactly what was happening but we had a nice gap to aim at and obviously that little bit of a wave of pressure from behind from three [furlongs] down probably helped her to get into gear. She took a bit of stoking but she never really had me worried, I always felt like she was going to keep finding under pressure. She's learnt a lot but has probably still got a little bit more to come - Tom Marquand, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looks better on AW than turf; had a 2nd wind op prior to this return; mark still feasible
🔦 Spotlight: Won three AW handicaps last year, notably a 1m Chelmsford success when last seen in October; beat male opposition there and a 4lb rise still leaves her feasibly weighted; had wind surgery (her second) in February; returns from an absence but still has potential on this surface; betting useful.

🔦 Spotlight: 7f turf win (heavy) for David Simcock as a 2yo; better form in two runs for 🆕 new yard last autumn, third in a Newmarket handicap (1m, soft) before a midfield finish in Listed race; switching to AW shouldn't be an issue and she's not fully exposed just yet.
