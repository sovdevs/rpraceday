🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy winner of her last two races and could be well in with her penalty
🔦 Spotlight: No great shakes in her first three chases but has won her last two, beating last week's Cheltenham winner Minniemum at Wincanton (3m1f) and then bolting up at long odds-on at Warwick last week (2m4f; again good ground); given those RPRs she looks well in with a penalty.

💬 Comment: Not bred for this far but all he did was plod on when beaten favourite over 2m3f at Exeter
🔦 Spotlight: Not bred for this far but all he did was plod on when a beaten favourite over 2m3f (good) at Exeter last time and the winner has gone in again since; two new forms of headgear are applied this afternoon and he has obvious claims, provided he stays.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beat just two other finishers for breakthrough win as a chaser at Fakenham two months ago
🔦 Spotlight: Jumping left was no great hardship around Fakenham two months ago and he beat two other finishers to register his first success as a chaser (1-16); only 3lb higher but promoted to a Class 4 this time.
Horse quote: 2021-11-26 at Doncaster (21f): "Lyrical Genius is a lovely youngster. He'll be a three-mile chaser and he's a lovely horse to have but we will not push hard this season. He'll probably step up to three miles at some stage - Charlie Longsdon, trainer, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 9yo; potentially well handicapped on the form he showed over hurdles and could yet come good over fences despite heavy defeats in his first two chases, both handicaps (2m and 3m).
