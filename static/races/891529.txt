🔦 Spotlight: 17-2, slowly into stride and green when never dangerous in Kempton maiden (1m, AW) three weeks ago, with plenty of pushing required to get him into sixth of 14; classy pedigree, though, and he could be a big 🚀 improver.

💬 Comment: Easily best run when Haydock 2nd (1m, good) in July; good chance on that; left H Charlton
🔦 Spotlight: Three races, easily best of them when second at Haydock (1m, good) last July; final start was on heavy ground; has changed hands and left Harry Charlton; good chance if reverting to that best effort.
