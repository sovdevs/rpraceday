💬 Comment: Just 1-16 over hurdles but improved for the switch to fences last month; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-16 over hurdles but improved for the switch to fences last month, making all to score by 19l at Exeter (3m, good to firm) before big run behind next-time-out winner Lady Jago at Wincanton (3m1f, good); up in grade today but still makes significant appeal.
Horse quote: 2024-01-11 at Catterick (25.5f): "It's just unfortunate, one of those things, and I feel sorry for the owners and the stable staff at home. I thought today Minniemum would lose her maiden tag and everything had gone right, she'd got into a nice rhythm. It's a shame. We'll try again - Richard Patrick, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-16 over hurdles but improved for the switch to fences last month, making all to score by 19l at Exeter (3m, good to firm) before big run behind next-time-out winner Lady Jago at Wincanton (3m1f, good); up in grade today but still makes significant appeal.

Horse quote: 2025-03-24 at Wincanton (25f): "Moviddy has put in a lot of good efforts and very often bumped into one so it's very satisfying to get that chase win. We'll quite possibly have a go at the final in which she finished fourth last year - Noel Williams, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up in this race a year ago but has performed well on all six outings this season, most notably when making all at Bangor (3m, soft) in February; quite versatile regarding ground; each-way claims at least.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good third here in December (2m4f) but another minor role may be her best hope today
🔦 Spotlight: Gained both chase wins at Hereford (3m1f, good) but her best form over fences was arguably her third here (2m4f, good to soft; just behind So Said I) in December; another minor role might be her best hope from just out of the weights today, though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Leicester on chase debut in December but below that form on both outings this year
🔦 Spotlight: Came from off the pace to beat Getbazoutofhere on chasing debut at Leicester (2m6f, soft; also suited by good) in December but was below form on both starts this year (2m7f/2m4f) and moves up in trip with a bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2024-12-01 at Leicester (22.5f): "Kosasiempre did it well and we weren't sure about the ground, but she's been progressing nicely and is still going the right way. We'll try and qualify her for the final as that's always been the aim. It's worth a lot of money and she needs to run again and finish in the first four, so she'll go to Fakenham on December 22 too - Stuart Edmunds, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well below best since returning from long absence this year; upped in trip today
🔦 Spotlight: Very well handicapped on old form over shorter trips for Gordon Elliott but returned from long layoff with two disappointing runs this year; fared a bit better in first-time cheekpieces at Ludlow (3m, good; race won by Saint Doctor) a fortnight ago but looked held when unseating rider at fourth-last fence; upped in trip and fitted with tongue-tie here.
Horse quote: 2022-08-07 at Downpatrick (19f): "Happy D'Ex has been a bit disappointing and is one we were considering moving on. Jack said that the fast gallop suited her well. It was a nice performance. Maybe she can build on that and she will definitely jump a fence - Gordon Elliott, trainer."
