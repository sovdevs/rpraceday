🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Finished well for second over 2m4f at Sandown last month, and has potential over 3m+
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in two of her three chases, more recently when keeping on strongly at Sandown (2m4f, good) last month; still 🔍 unexposed over fences and over staying trips; high on the list.

💬 Comment: Back in prime form in recent weeks, winning three in a row; tries a new trip today
🔦 Spotlight: Back in prime form in recent weeks, completing a hat-trick with comfortable success in four-runner race at Ludlow (2m4f, good) a fortnight ago; only 1lb below career-high mark now and has stamina to prove over this new trip but still respected in current mood.
Horse quote: 2025-02-14 at Fakenham (21f): "It's very satisfying to get Sainte Doctor back in the winner's enclosure and I've won on her a few times now. She has had her problems but we've ironed them out and that was a lovely performance - Richie McLernon, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2024-01-11 at Catterick (25.5f): "It's just unfortunate, one of those things, and I feel sorry for the owners and the stable staff at home.

🔦 Spotlight: Gained both chase wins at Hereford (3m1f, good) but her best form over fences was arguably her third here (2m4f, good to soft; just behind So Said I) in December; another minor role might be her best hope from just out of the weights today, though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Leicester on chase debut in December but below that form on both outings this year
🔦 Spotlight: Came from off the pace to beat Getbazoutofhere on chasing debut at Leicester (2m6f, soft; also suited by good) in December but was below form on both starts this year (2m7f/2m4f) and moves up in trip with a bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2024-12-01 at Leicester (22.5f): "Kosasiempre did it well and we weren't sure about the ground, but she's been progressing nicely and is still going the right way. We'll try and qualify her for the final as that's always been the aim. It's worth a lot of money and she needs to run again and finish in the first four, so she'll go to Fakenham on December 22 too - Stuart Edmunds, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well below best since returning from long absence this year; upped in trip today
🔦 Spotlight: Very well handicapped on old form over shorter trips for Gordon Elliott but returned from long layoff with two disappointing runs this year; fared a bit better in first-time cheekpieces at Ludlow (3m, good; race won by Saint Doctor) a fortnight ago but looked held when unseating rider at fourth-last fence; upped in trip and fitted with tongue-tie here.
Horse quote: 2022-08-07 at Downpatrick (19f): "Happy D'Ex has been a bit disappointing and is one we were considering moving on. Jack said that the fast gallop suited her well. It was a nice performance. Maybe she can build on that and she will definitely jump a fence - Gordon Elliott, trainer."
