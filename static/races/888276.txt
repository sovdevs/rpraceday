🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Escapes penalty for recent Southwell win; obvious claims if in the right mood again here
🔦 Spotlight: Has a few quirks and is not one to rely upon heavily but returned to form with clearcut success in conditional jockeys' race at Warwick (2m, good) eight days ago and runs without a penalty here; will be fine over today's longer trip and has very obvious claims if in the right mood again.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Came good at Market Rasen a fortnight ago and further progress is possible
🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles at seventh attempt, with clearcut success at Market Rasen (2m4f, good to soft) a fortnight ago; subsequent 4lb rise does not look excessive and further progress is possible; one to consider.

💬 Comment: Not at best this season but ran okay last month, after a wind op; remains on good mark
🔦 Spotlight: Generally disappointing this season but seemed to have benefited from a wind op when close fourth behind Greatness Awaits at Ludlow (2m, soft) last month; remains on a good mark and is 🔍 unexposed over 2m4f; contender if able to build upon that recent effort.

💬 Comment: Second on hurdle debut for Willie Mullins; twice below that form for new stable
🔦 Spotlight: Sold out of Willie Mullins' stable for £4,000 after going close on hurdling debut at Thurles (2m4f, good) in November; below that form on both starts for current stable and will need to take a big step forward to overcome top weight on this handicap debut.
