🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-7 over hurdles, good efforts two of last three starts, this trip could suit well, chance
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 over hurdles but has shaped well in two of her last three starts at 2m, including here on latest (raised 2lb); had excuses on penultimate over 2m4f at Fairyhouse; this trip could suit her well and she is one of the more likely ones.

💬 Comment: Won here over 2m4f in January, couldn't repeat over 2m3f off 7lb higher, can't discount
🔦 Spotlight: Gained first win here when making all over 2m4f (soft) in January off 88; up 7lb and couldn't repeat the trick a month later over 2m3f; has had a six week break and has a chance if he can get back to the form of his course win.
