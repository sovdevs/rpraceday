🔦 Spotlight: Good strike-rate since off the mark last February, winning four of her last nine starts at 5f and 6f; often leads but was ridden more patiently for recent 5f win over Second Collection and those tactics should work well now returned to 6f; respected despite the penalty.

🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner whose two wins on this track came over 6f and 5f in 2023; harder to place these days but he gave best only late on over C&D 12 days ago and a lean spell may be on the verge of ending.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two handicap wins as 2yo; rarely shone since but promising for new in-form yard latest
🔦 Spotlight: Two handicap wins as a 2yo; has rarely flared into life since but she ran her best race for a while when a close fifth in a similar C&D race on debut for new in-form yard this month; neither weights nor draw favour her today but she could be on the verge of a turnaround.
