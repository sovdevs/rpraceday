🔦 Spotlight: No win in first 24 starts but he's made all here in two of his last three runs, including over C&D last Saturday; up 6lb but that was a comfortable success on his first run at this trip and he remains well treated on best form; leading contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Successful in a 6f handicap at Southwell in November but that hasn't been a springboard to better things; respectable efforts after slow starts in her two runs (C&D/turf) this spring but she's now 1-11 and needs to find more in first-time blinkers.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On dangerous mark but has a tough draw and others look more likely
🔦 Spotlight: All four AW wins have come on Polytrack; returned from an absence with a respectable fourth over C&D in February but he failed to build on that here last month; on dangerous mark but has another tough draw and others look more likely.

🔦 Spotlight: Had some close calls last year but he ended 2024 with a heavy defeat at Newcastle (6f), when he bled from the nose and was reported to have had an irregular heartbeat; has something to prove after 193 days off and his last win was in July 2023.
