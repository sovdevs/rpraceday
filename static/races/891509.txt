🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returns from an absence but this lightly raced 4yo retains potential for her powerful yard
🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced favourite at Lingfield last August and absent since; however, this lightly raced 4yo had been showing some good form previously, including a close third at Newmarket (6f, good) on her second handicap start; retains potential for powerful Lambourn stable and could have a big say on her return.

🔦 Spotlight: Last season concluded with a rare below-par run but she won twice earlier in the campaign (6f, soft/good) and also ran well on her 2024 reappearance; could have a part to play on this year's comeback.
Horse quote: 2023-10-10 at Leicester (6f): "It was a good effort from Wichahpi. The cheekpieces have done her no harm since they were applied and the race went perfectly for her. She kept finding and was suited by the slow ground - Graham Lee, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Mare who was in rude health towards the end of last season, with three wins (5.7f/6f, including on good/good to soft) from her final six starts; in the mix if reappearing in the same vein.
Horse quote: 2022-07-05 at Pontefract (5f): "Vaunted tries her heart out. She didn't get a run last time, she wouldn't have won but she'd have been second - Nigel Tinkler, trainer."

Horse quote: 2021-10-06 at Nottingham (6f): "Parisiac was a bit keen early on but he finished the race really well. I gave him one backhander and he just went. I ride him everyday at home, he's a bit tricky but the boss gave me the opportunity to ride him and he showed his ability. He'll learn a lot from today - Gianluca Sanna, jockey."

Horse quote: 2023-09-17 at Musselburgh (5f): "Ziggy's Queen is learning with racing. There wasn't really much pace in the race so I thought it would be ideal if I could jump and get an easy lead. She only had to really run (sprint) for two furlongs, so she'll probably come on for that again - Oisin Orr, jockey speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: 11yo who has won over C&D and was on the scoresheet at Newcastle (6f, AW) in January; also ran well on his next three starts but his form has dipped the last twice and he needs to raise his game today.
Horse quote: 2023-11-02 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "Muscika is a lovely old boy. The last day at Epsom went really well and today went the same, he jumped out and has a nice gate speed, which is good from a low draw here. We went a nice enough gallop but I didn't have to use too much petrol and he travelled into it well. He's really found his form again - Cieren Fallon, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who was well beaten more often than not last year but she showed spark on occasions and is on a competitive mark; perhaps first time up will be the time to catch her.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 10yo who is well treated on last year's best form but was soundly beaten on reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who is well treated on last year's best form and could improve for his reappearance seventh at Thirsk a fortnight ago; however, he was soundly beaten and his losing run goes back 15 races to August 2023.
Horse quote: 2023-08-19 at Ripon (6f): "I was a bit shocked, but Roundhay Park does turn up every time and tries his heart out. It's lovely getting on such genuine horses. I was doing a rain dance last night as he does like it with a bit of soft in the ground. He's so genuine and kept on finding - Faye McManoman, jockey."
