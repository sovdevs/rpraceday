🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy mare has taken well to chasing; good chance she can concede weight here
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner over hurdles but already a much better chaser after two starts; dominant winner of a 2m6f Grade 2 mares' novice at Limerick over Christmas and a month later finished a clear second to leading Brown Advisory candidate Dancing City in 3m1f Grade 3 at Naas; classy mare and good chance she can concede weight to her four rivals here.

🔦 Spotlight: Point winner won a maiden hurdle here last year before fine second to a stablemate in a Grade 1 novice here; reappeared in December to make winning chasing debut in 2m5f Cork mares' beginners', jumping right but knuckling down well on ground probably plenty quick; runner-up well held since but Townend's pick here so has to be respected.

💬 Comment: Held by stablemate Judicieuse Allen on recent form; hard to see her playing a major role
🔦 Spotlight: Just 1-5 chasing, well held behind stablemate Judicieuse Allen over C&D on penultimate and behind same rival at Thurles last time; probably wants a bit furher and hard to see her playing a major role.
