🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Handicap debut for A Balding contained promise; 13,000gns buy; now has 5f and cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: No impact in her three qualifying races but made a big move in the penultimate furlong when close fourth of eight on handicap debut at Kempton (6f, Polytrack) four weeks ago; left Andrew Balding for 13,000gns ten days later; now tries 5f and cheekpieces, both for the first time (has been hooded); could have some potential.

🔦 Spotlight: Found improvement dropped to 5.3f on nursery debut when scoring at Brighton in September; close second at Chelmsford (5f, Polytrack) in October and probably has more to offer; considered despite wide draw.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On the premises over 5f in all four of her handicaps, two over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: On the premises over 5f in all four of her handicaps, two over C&D including when Frankies Dream proved much too strong for her in the closing stages last time; she may again have to settle for minor honours.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Held up; did not get run of the race last time but that made recent form figures 122112
🔦 Spotlight: Comes from off the pace, which did not work out behind a front-running winner at Southwell ten days ago but he beat the rest comfortably and that made his recent form figures 122112; the second of those wins was over C&D; firmly on the up and needs major respect.

🔦 Spotlight: First 5f race since debut when second of four over C&D two weeks ago in second-time cheekpieces, slowly away but leading 2f out; there's a bit to iron out (he also hung early in straight) but could be on his way back.

🔦 Spotlight: Turf maiden winner last May; finished sixth in a couple of AW handicaps in the autumn, looking better than the bare result over C&D last time but, after nearly three months off, she needs to build on that performance.
