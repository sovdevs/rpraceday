💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner who is likely to need this after 283 days off
🔦 Spotlight: Dual C&D winner who was running well over hurdles last summer but this veteran is likely to need the run after 283 days off.
Horse quote: 2019-06-30 at Uttoxeter (16f): "Chef De Troupe was entitled to win after his easy win at Southwell last week under a penalty. He was inclined to jump to his right again but actually seemed much better when able to take a lead. He is progressive - Sean Bowen, jockey."
