🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Opened her account in Fakenham event last time but the form is open to doubt
🔦 Spotlight: Opened her rules account in Fakenham event (3m) on April Fools' Day but sole rival seemingly failed to give her running and the form is open to doubt; no certainty to follow up.
Horse quote: 2025-04-01 at Fakenham (24f): "Halfway down the far side I thought the horse in front of me was not getting any further away, and when I managed to get upsides her she came off the bridle as well. I had a very willing partner in Ballygelly - David Noonan, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good chance on best form (hurdles/fences) but needs a revival
🔦 Spotlight: Won over hurdles last April and placed twice over fences in October, all off higher marks; good chance on those runs but has lost his form since; needs a revival.

🔦 Spotlight: Far from solid on his hurdles form for current yard and has enough to prove back over fences (achieved little in Irish chase starts); new headgear.
