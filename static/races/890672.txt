🔦 Spotlight: Has proved a revelation on the AW this year (213111) with his wins coming over 7f-9.5f; failed to beat a rival in his only previous visit here (7f), but he is a completely different proposition now and is much respected in his bid for the four-timer; 4-7 under Joe Leavy.

🔦 Spotlight: 1-3 on turf in France for Andre Fabre; didn't show much in his first two starts for this yard (1m, Tapeta), but much better when third of 12 in an even warmer handicap than this over C&D (80-1) seven weeks ago; three of those behind have won since so he is a major player from the same mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2-4 over C&D and one for the shortlist up another 3lb in his bid for the four-timer
🔦 Spotlight: Best known for his Wolverhampton exploits (six wins) but is 2-4 over this C&D; 3-3 so far this year and one for the shortlist up another 3lb in his bid for the four-timer, despite an awkward draw.
Horse quote: 2025-02-16 at Lingfield (AW) (10f): "Arcadian Nights has got form with a lot of the horses he was taking on. His only quirk is in the stalls and he was a bit slow getting out but he found the prominent rhythm and has a good turn of foot - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has never been this far or raced on Polytrack before; others more solid
🔦 Spotlight: Running well on the AW this year including two wins on the Southwell Tapeta (7f/1m), but has never been this far or raced on Polytrack before; others more solid.
Horse quote: 2023-07-29 at York (7f): "Bajan Bandit made all when he won at Haydock then we were duped by a shower of rain half an hour before the race last time there and held him up. This looked a competitive event but he won well enough. At some point we'll try him over a mile again but there's no rush - Grant Tuer, trainer."
