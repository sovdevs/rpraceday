🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Conditions to suit and won well here three weeks ago; should remain competitive
🔦 Spotlight: Three C&D wins since August, the latest three weeks ago; recorded a much quicker time than Chola Empire did in Division 1 of that race and a 5lb rise isn't punitive; has work to do with Federal Envoy on their C&D meeting in December though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Changed hands since winning a Kempton handicap in September; tongue-tie absent on return
🔦 Spotlight: Prominent racer; off the mark at the 11th time of asking when making all at Kempton (1m) last September; sold for 21,000gns the following month; 4lb rise not insurmountable but he goes without a tongue-tie on his first run for Michael Dods.
