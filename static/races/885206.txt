üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Three wins from his six starts; may well evolve into something better than a handicapper
üî¶ Spotlight: Made it 3-5 (wins on good to soft-good to firm) when making all in big-field handicap at York (1m) last August; fourth of 20 at Ascot (1m, soft) next time when conditions seemed a shade too demanding; this lightly raced 4yo may well evolve into something better than a handicapper.

üí¨ Comment: Lightly raced 5yo who goes well fresh and his trainer has won this four times
üî¶ Spotlight: Lightly raced 5yo who was inconsistent last season (merely mid-division on last two runs) but he was a fine second in the Spring Cup at Newbury (1m, good to soft) on last year's reappearance and his win at Goodwood (1m, good to soft) in August came after a 72-day break; clearly goes well fresh and may yet have more left in the tank for a trainer who has won this four times.
