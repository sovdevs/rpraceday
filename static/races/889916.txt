🔦 Spotlight: Ran twice last season; much-improved after a year off, recovering from a scare two out (rider almost unseated) to record an emphatic win in a maiden at Leicester; gave a more polished display when following up at Lingfield; handled heavy ground well for both wins; interesting British-trained contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Versatile performer, Royal Ascot handicap winner, needs to jump better than at Fairyhouse
🔦 Spotlight: Listed winner on soft in France at two; three wins at Kempton in 2022; won Punchestown maiden hurdle last May and landed the  1m6f Copper Horse Handicap at Royal Ascot; out of depth in Group 2 at Ascot in October; jumping was untidy when unplaced in a Fairyhouse Grade 2 won by a longer-priced stablemate.
