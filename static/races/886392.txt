🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1,374-day absence before last month's return, an encouraging run given the inadequate 6f
🔦 Spotlight: 2-2 for Charlie Appleby but those races were in 2020 and 2021; his 1,374-day absence included wind and gelding operations, plus a 12,000gns sale last September; last month's return (tongue tied) was well below his old form but looked encouraging given the inadequate 6f; dropped 5lb and could be competitive if he does indeed build on that display.

🔦 Spotlight: Sole win (12 races) was on turf but he looks at least as effective over 1m on AW and has been runner-up over C&D; looked close to his best at Southwell on latest outing and now tries cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Absent five months and this race is likely to precede a return to longer trips
🔦 Spotlight: Ended a losing run last May (1m4f here) and also scored in July (1m2f on turf); absent five months today and his only other run over this short a trip in recent years was this race last term when never dangerous, beaten only 3l admittedly but this race is also likely to precede a return to further.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f win here nine days ago but he looked just as effective last term over 1m as 7f; up 4lb
🔦 Spotlight: Three good runs from four starts (all here) since he returned to action in December, most notably with a 7f win nine days ago but he looked just as effective last term over 1m as 7f; up 4lb but firmly in the mix.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fine AW performer but seen mostly over 7f; 0-8 (twice second) over about 1m
🔦 Spotlight: Held up; 9-39 is a cracking strike-rate on AW and he's run on well for minor honours here on two of his three starts this winter, behind Rey De La Batalla on latest; the big issue is that the vast majority of his races have been 7f and he's 0-8 (twice second) over about 1m.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Switches to cheekpieces; player with the same galvanising effect as blinkers had initially
🔦 Spotlight: Blinkered by new trainer and it paid immediate dividends with two wins in December, over C&D on first occasion; ran respectably when beaten about 3l on both starts since and now switches to cheekpieces; player if they have the same galvanising effect as blinkers had initially.

🔦 Spotlight: Needs better than he showed at Wolverhampton last time but not discredited that day and he was in career-best form over C&D (first and a close third) on his previous two starts this year; major player back here.
