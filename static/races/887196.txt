🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't get home over 3m4f this month but in good form over 2m4f-2m5f beforehand; a player
🔦 Spotlight: Did not get home after racing too freely in Plumpton marathon this month but was in good form over 2m4f-2m5f beforehand; arguably second best on merit when third behind smart rival in valuable series final at Fakenham (2m5f, good) two starts ago and has strong claims if back on song here; swaps usual blinkers for first-time cheekpieces.

🔦 Spotlight: Came good over fences at 13th attempt, keeping on well to draw 12l clear at Fakenham (2m5f, good) on New Year's Day; lost ground when reluctant to jump off there later in January but eventually kept on for respectable fourth (just behind So Said I) in a valuable series final; no surprise if she features.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Readily beat Ede'iffs Rock by 8l at Huntingdon last month and still 🔍 unexposed over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time hurdle winner; flopped badly when favourite for chasing debut in 2023 but returned to fences with ready success at Huntingdon (2m7f, soft) last month, beating Ede'iffs Rock by 8l; too inconsistent to rely upon heavily but a recent 7lb rise is manageable if she's in the right mood again.
