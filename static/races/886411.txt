💬 Comment: 🚀 improver who made it 3-3 at Kempton when scoring over C&D in December; leading contender
🔦 Spotlight: Found more progress and made it 3-3 at Kempton when justifying support over C&D in December; up 4lb but that was a comfortable success and he still has low mileage; major player again.

💬 Comment: Showed promise in his qualifying runs and needs a close look on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Showed promise in two runs for William Haggas last summer; changed hands for 6,500gns in the autumn but he returned for 🆕 new yard with an eyecatching fourth over C&D last month; that was behind some useful prospects and this is more realistic on handicap debut; needs a close look in market.
