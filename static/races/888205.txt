🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well beaten on first two hurdling starts but last month's Taunton third was much better
🔦 Spotlight: Began hurdling career with two very disappointing runs in the autumn but last month's Taunton third (2m3f, soft) was much more encouraging, and he could easily have more improvement to come in handicaps; ran okay in a good-ground bumper last year; needs to be taken very seriously.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Shaped with promise in a 2m maiden last month; back up in trip for handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Safely held in all three qualifying races but positives can be drawn from last month's Huntingdon fifth (2m, good to soft); moves back up in trip for today's handicap debut and remains 🔍 unexposed; market may guide.

💬 Comment: Did not emerge from the rear division in his first three handicap hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Fair on the Flat at his best; did not emerge from the rear division in his first three handicap hurdles (1m7f-2m3f) but has travelled from Somerset to run here and is worth a glance in the betting.
