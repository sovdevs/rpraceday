🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran quite well when third at Lingfield last month but may prefer ground slower than good
🔦 Spotlight: Free-goer who is usually ridden very patiently; gave good account when third at Lingfield (2m, soft) last month and is 2lb lower here but today's quicker ground may not be ideal and he's not one to rely upon too heavily.

🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 6yo; well beaten over 2m7f on stable/chase debut in October but returned from another layoff with pretty good third at Bangor (2m1f, heavy) last month and has plenty of scope for further progress if today's faster ground suits.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't run badly here on latest hurdling start and may fare better now chasing
🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 over hurdles but didn't run badly in first-time tongue-tie/cheekpieces here (2m, good to soft) last month, and his good-ground point win in 2022 bodes quite well for his prospects on this chasing debut; blinkers tried this time.
