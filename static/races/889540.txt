🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D success two weeks ago took his AW record to 14231; respected off unaltered mark
🔦 Spotlight: Had to work harder than expected to justify favouritism in C&D event (first 2m attempt) two weeks ago but displayed a game attitude and took his AW record to 14231; particularly 🔍 unexposed at this trip and may still have further improvement in him; respected off unaltered mark.
