🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easily beat Through The Ages here last week; no penalty and he's up 10lb in future
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive 5yo who has won three of his last four starts (awarded the race two runs back) and made light work of Through The Ages over C&D nine days ago (heavy); escapes a penalty for that and he's up 10lb in future.

🔦 Spotlight: Signs were more positive with respectable runs at Southwell and Kempton (both on good) and he ran better than his ninth place may suggest on handicap debut at Musselburgh (good to soft) last time; softer ground here could be an issue but he's not discounted.

🔦 Spotlight: Won twice over hurdles in 2022 when based in France; has failed to complete in six runs for this yard but was in the process of running better when falling at Hereford and reportedly finished lame when last seen nearly a year ago; cheekpieces worn the last twice are left off; worth a 📊 market check.
