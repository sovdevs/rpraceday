🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Finished well to score on chase/handicap debut in December; commands respect
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who won a maiden hurdle last spring and finished well to pip a next-time-out winner when reappearing in handicap chase at Taunton (2m7f, good) in December; needs to prove himself on ground slower than good but, otherwise, has very strong claims.

💬 Comment: Maiden hurdle winner; disappointed on chase debut but may still do well over fences
🔦 Spotlight: Delivered on earlier promise when winning three-runner maiden hurdle on seasonal/stable debut in November; made jumping errors and was unable to justify good market support when pulled up on chasing debut in December but may not have handled the heavy ground that day and could still have a good future over fences.

🔦 Spotlight: Won over C&D just under a year ago and ran game race when close second over C&D (again on soft) in December; ran poorly at Exeter last month but was given a wind op soon afterwards and the return to this track is an obvious plus; swaps blinkers for refitted cheekpieces; can't be ruled out.
