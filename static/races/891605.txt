🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has easily made all on both outings in these cheekpieces and holds strong claims once more
🔦 Spotlight: Easily made all in first-time cheekpieces (retained since) at Beverley (8.4f, good) last month and did likewise under a penalty there (8.4f, good) eight days ago; she's running off a 9lb higher mark than last time but there's a good chance that won't stop this thriving 4yo.
Horse quote: 2025-04-24 at Beverley (8.5f): "Two B Tanned arrived in February and we've been learning more about her. She has a high cruising speed and Joe is very good from the front. I'm not sure we'll be so far in front of the handicapper in the future, but we've had a great few days with her - Steve Brown, trainer's assistant."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over C&D off this mark last July and fair effort on AW recently; could go well
🔦 Spotlight: Won off this mark over C&D (good) last July, which was the middle leg of a hat-trick; inconsistent, but she was also on the scoresheet at Wolverhampton (9.4f, AW) in December and returned from a three-month break with a close fifth at Newcastle (1m, AW) three weeks ago; could go well.
Horse quote: 2024-07-03 at Musselburgh (9f): "Sam James gave Jumeira Vision him a wonderful ride, he was very tough but Sam did think he had a bit left in the tank at the finish. It was a bit of a shock when Jumeira Vision won last time, although Katie has always said he works well at home. It's more that the conditions haven't been right until now - Craig Talbot, owners' spokesperson."

🔦 Spotlight: Last season ended with two disappointing runs here but she won over 1m here last June and went close over this C&D last July; can give a good account if she's back on song on today's reappearance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His mark continues to fall but there's been no revival on his two starts for this yard
🔦 Spotlight: His mark continues to fall but there's been no revival on his first two starts for this yard (7f, AW) and he's now 0-10; remains to be seen whether this longer trip will suit; wears a first-time tongue-tie.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The drop back in trip is in her favour but she may find some of these too strong
🔦 Spotlight: Won on the Flat (1m) and over hurdles (2m) last May/June and showed spark before fading into fourth of five at Newcastle (1m4f, AW) this March on her second stable start; tackling 2m there when tailed off latest; the drop back in trip is in her favour but she may find some of these too strong.
