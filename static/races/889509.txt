🔦 Spotlight: Won a 0-58 handicap in first-time cheekpieces over C&D in January and a similar contest to this at Newcastle (1m, Tapeta) this month; shaped as though the return to this trip would suit when third of 11 at Wolverhampton (8.6f, Tapeta) a week ago, but he has finished behind Brinton on all three occasions they have met.
