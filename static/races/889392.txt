🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fifth last time was step back in right direction; longer trip a plus; high on the list
🔦 Spotlight: Recent form-figures look unpromising but he has had excuses, and fifth over 2m4f here last time was a move back in right direction; headgear back on and this step back up in distance should suit; high on the list.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Arrives in good form in the mud; today's forecast faster ground a possible concern
🔦 Spotlight: Won by 10l at Ffos Las (2m4f, soft) in January, his fourth hurdling success, and was second over the same C&D (heavy) last month; evidently in good nick and shapes as if he'll stay this far, but today's forecast faster ground could be a concern.

🔦 Spotlight: Three wins at around 3m on soft (including here) last term; as good as ever when third at Haydock in December and 2m3f was an inadequate trip next time; had an excuse (lost a shoe) latest start so may well bounce back, although (as for stablemate Paddy O'Mahler) drying ground could be an issue.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 10yo; some improvement when third of five at Bangor (2m7f, heavy) four weeks ago, rallying; that doesn't look especially strong form but she's still impossible to discount.

🔦 Spotlight: Won two novice hurdles at Stratford in June 2024 but has cut little ice since, including on stable debut (after wind surgery) last time; falling in weights but best watched unless there's a market move in his favour.
