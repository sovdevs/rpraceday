🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two hurdles wins for current yard; three-time Flat scorer; may have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive over hurdles for current yard until a disappointing effort (in hat-trick attempt) last time; three-time Flat winner and may still have more to offer in general; enters calculations.
Horse quote: 2025-02-22 at Newcastle (20.5f): "Surrey Belle is a good filly, she's got a great cruising speed and loads of scope. When I bought her I had fences in mind.   She'll probably end up a 130-rated filly over hurdles and she'll be a really exciting novice chaser for next season.   We'll keep an eye on the weather at Cheltenham, when you go up into that type of class give in the ground would help her a lot, but she's also in the Herring Queen Series final at Kelso, that's a £100,000 race and gives me a bit more time after today so that's probably where she'll go next - Adrian Keatley, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Defied a 6lb higher mark at the York Ebor festival (2m) in 2023; has failed to repeat that form since and folded tamely on reappearance; drops back further in grade.
Horse quote: 2023-08-23 at York (16.5f): "That was a good performance. Forza Orta had looked a bit one-paced over shorter distances so we decided to try something different. He got the trip well, we always thought he would eventually, and that opens an awful lot of avenues to us - Kevin Ryan, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Respectable fourth of six in this race 12 months ago
🔦 Spotlight: Respectable fourth of six (off 1lb higher) in this race on reappearance 12 months ago but didn't peak until York success in July; perhaps one to look out for later in the campaign.
Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at York (16.5f): "I wasn't worried about losing it in the stewards' room as the second bumped him too. I thought he'd go well but I don't know what happened at Newcastle. Zimmerman loves soft ground and stays two miles, so we'll find something for him if it stays wet - Tim Easterby, trainer."
