🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 5yo who has been second on his last three runs; wears first-time cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 but good second here (2m3f, soft) in December and went close at Fakenham (2m, good) and Sandown (2m4f, heavy) in his two starts since; first-time cheekpieces could eke out something extra and he's one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: 9yo who needs to prove how much ability he retains but he's well treated on his French/British form up to spring 2023 and he ran well for a fair way at Haydock (2m5f, soft) last month on his first start back from a long absence; could improve for that outing and he's not ruled out.
