💬 Comment: Had five defeats, though his only real blip was in a Listed race; golden chance here
🔦 Spotlight: Had five defeats, though his only real blip was in a Listed race; ✂️ gelded ahead of his return over 6f at Nottingham (good) and, although turned over at odds-on, he was beaten by his market rival who showed plenty last year; this looks a golden chance to get his head in front.
