🔦 Spotlight: Caught the eye when fourth of ten on her return from a break over 6f here this month and may have finished even closer with a clearer run; 6lb lower than when winning over C&D early last year; respected.
Horse quote: 2023-12-07 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "Lady In Havana has learned quite a lot but the penny is still dropping and hopefully we can have a nice, fun winter with her. Every stride she took the penny was dropping more and she'll be an exciting prospect for the team - Laura Pearson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Has won seven times here (including twice on Fibresand), the latest over 1m last month; does seem better suited to that trip these days, though, so has enough to prove from the outside draw with a visor belatedly given a go.
Horse quote: 2024-02-15 at Southwell (AW) (8f): "I couldn't understand the price, we thought this was a penalty kick. Al Suil Eile was entered at Wolverhampton but this extra meeting came on and it was perfect for him. It felt like a gift really. He's been a star for us this year. He's taken a while and he's had his problems but this year his joints and everything are good. He'll come back to Southwell for a 0-70 on the Sunday night, March 10. It's treble the prize money and it's the same sort of race. I can't see the handicapper going too mad, a couple more pounds maybe and that will be fine. - Shaun Harris, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Seven wins, including four on the AW, but losing run up to 21 and her close third of 11 here (1m) in September looked a flash in the pan.
Horse quote: 2022-03-12 at Lingfield (AW) (7f): "They went hard enough up front which suited Rainbow Mirage and I'm pleased to win on my first ride for the stable - George Rooke, jockey."
