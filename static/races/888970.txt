🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won 2m5f claimer at Limerick, strong contender though the shorter trip is a concern
🔦 Spotlight: Out of form before last month's wide-margin front-running win in a 2m5f claiming hurdle at Limerick, repeating his 2024 success in the event; shorter trip could be an issue in this rematch with Ellaat, beaten 16l in third in last month's race; talented rider's 5lb claim is a positive.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Should be better for run behind Robinstown at Limerick, may reverse form over this trip
🔦 Spotlight: 3-18 over hurdles; yet to win over timber for current yard but score on the Flat at Gowran in October 2023; was appearing for the first time in almost a year when beaten 16l in third behind Robinstown over 2m5f at Limerick; should be sharper now and may get the better of the winner in the rematch.

🔦 Spotlight: Often partnered last season by this amateur rider, including when a Cork win came out of the blue at 40-1; showed good form  to finish second in Flat handicaps at Navan and Galway last October; never seriously involved in a 2m handicap hurdle at Navan in November; fair chance in this company if restored to form, but the stable probably has a better chance with Ellaat.
