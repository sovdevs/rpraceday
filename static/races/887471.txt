🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made good progress last summer and not fully exposed; going left handed a slight niggle
🔦 Spotlight: Won a couple of Listed fillies' events last June before appearing to take a good step forward when second in the Group 1 Falmouth Stakes the following month; travelled strongly and showed a potent turn of foot in a Group 3 at Glorious Goodwood when last seen, surging to the front but drifting right and losing the race in the Stewards' room; can progress further this year and strong contender, for all going right handed may be optimal.

🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive 3yo in 2024, winning three times including a Group 3 in Baden-Baden (6f, soft); escapes a penalty for that win and his record around Chester bodes well for him taking to this track; sold out of Andrew Balding's stable for 42,000gns last October; one to consider.

💬 Comment: Classy on his day and recent return came in a race not run to suit; capable of a big run
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in last season's Lockinge and also boasts some strong 7f form; last week's return to action at Lingfield (1m) didn't see him to best effect but it was still a promising return; wouldn't want this to be tactical but that seems unlikely with a few of these happiest going forward.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Big chance if at his best but he failed to fire twice last autumn; has a rare 7f run today
🔦 Spotlight: Has some high-class 6f form on AW, including when recording an RPR of 115 in a 6f handicap here last summer; rather blotted his copybook with a couple of low-key runs last autumn but he'll be a danger to all if anywhere near his best after 112 days off; promise in both 7f runs early in his career.
