🔦 Spotlight: Finished only fifth when favourite for the King George (good) on last appearance; otherwise a 📈 progressive chaser and remains of strong interest with a rebound on the cards; completed a Grade 1 double (2m4f/3m1f) last spring before running very well in a cracking John Durkan at Punchestown (2m3f) where he split the Willie Mullins-trained stars Fact To File and Galopin Des Champs; that bare form is very persuasive.
