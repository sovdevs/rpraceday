🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled up on reappearance but is back in cheekpieces, worn for 10l win in this last year
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled up on reappearance at Ascot in November but he was without these cheekpieces, which have been on for his last three wins, including this race last year (soft; by 10l); he's a major player if returning to his best.
