🔦 Spotlight: Had wind surgery after both his bumpers last term; modest form in novice hurdles this season until doing his best to upset a 1-14 shot in an Exeter match (2m5.5f, good) last time; handicapper hasn't taken that form literally and he now enters this sphere up in trip off a workable mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark over hurdles at Huntingdon (about 2m4f, good) in November; pulled up on soft next time but subsequently ran well on AW, in this headgear combination, in January; outpaced but a fair effort, after wind surgery, last month (again at Kempton over 2m) and now returns to hurdles over a trip he promises to stay; ran well when second on his only start here; chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Step up in trip and better ground look positives for her handicap debut; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Best effort in three qualifying runs came on her hurdles debut at Wincanton (2m5.5f, good to soft; Dino Magic third) in November, staying on for second albeit beaten 13l; ran on softer ground the last twice but this daughter of Jukebox Jury should be suited by this step up in trip on her handicap debut, with the quicker ground a likely plus too; yard was 4-9 over jumps last month.
