🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bred to be smart; impressive winner on handicap debut (6f) on Tuesday; under penalty
🔦 Spotlight: Bred to be smart and he improved greatly for the winter break and switch to handicaps when winning at Yarmouth (6f, good to firm) on Tuesday, running freely in front but soon having his rivals on the stretch; that wasn't a strong race and he's under a penalty today but more of an issue will be whether he still has his edge on this quick return.

🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner on all three starts, at 7f and 6f, but he couldn't sustain the gallop when a beaten favourite over this trip on Newcastle AW in February; should find his feet in handicaps in due course but he'll be pushed to get an easy lead today.

💬 Comment: Promising winner of handicap debut on AW (6f) as 2yo; up 6lb; more to come; 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Minor form when qualifying but he came home strongly to win in good style on handicap debut at Kempton (AW; 6f) in October, when beating a multiple subsequent winner; left Ed Walker for 30,000gns and ✂️ gelded; today's run might be needed but he has potential despite the 6lb higher mark.

💬 Comment: Met trouble in running when just failing on handicap debut (6f, AW); interesting prospect
🔦 Spotlight: Started off from a very low base but his final qualifying run was better and he only just failed to make a winning handicap debut on Newcastle AW (6f; well-backed favourite) in November, when hard to settle and hampered quite badly but came home strongly; up 3lb; interesting prospect.

💬 Comment: Quite impressive in Nottingham handicap on final 2yo start; well worth this first go at 6f
🔦 Spotlight: Has led but she came from off the pace when ultimately quite impressive in her fourth and final handicap start as 2yo, on soft at Nottingham; returned to action with a close fourth at Catterick and there could be more to come now tackling 6f.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Quite promising reappearance at Catterick (6f) on handicap debut; should improve
🔦 Spotlight: Has run well on first start of both campaigns and might have been up against it on comeback/handicap debut at Catterick (6f, good) recently when still quite a promising third of seven; open to improvement.

💬 Comment: Best form over 5f; weights turnaround with Jeany May on 2yo form; trip query back at 6f
🔦 Spotlight: Best form over 5f, as when third to Jeany May at Nottingham (soft) in November but he's no good thing to turn things round with that one on the revised terms after a low-key start to 3yo career at Catterick, especially as he's yet to prove 6f suits.
