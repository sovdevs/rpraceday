🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Outstayed over 1m2f here when last seen; ✂️ gelded since; may do better still
🔦 Spotlight: Stablemate of Present Times; sent north to win at Thirsk (7f) on penultimate 2yo start then was seemingly outstayed over 1m2f on soft ground here; ✂️ gelded since; may have more to offer back down in trip.
Horse quote: 2024-09-16 at Thirsk (7f): "Watching Stars is a rhythm horse, he'll stay. By the way he moves, he probably wouldn't want it too soft but he's been improving at home and he's learning on the job - Dougie Costello, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."
