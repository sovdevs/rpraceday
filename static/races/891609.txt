🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has no fancy entries but evidently very talented (2-2) and should get better
🔦 Spotlight: Tip-top pedigree; only narrowly did he make a winning debut at Newmarket (7f, good to soft) but improved to beat a consistent/useful rival at Nottingham (extended 1m, good) where he showed a tendency to hang left in the first-time hood but still won cosily; has no fancy entries but evidently very talented and should get better.
Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Newmarket (7f): "Secret Theory is a nice horse with a pedigree to die for. There is improvement in him as he only came to hand six weeks ago but I think we'll put him away after that - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

💬 Comment: Impressive winner at two; well held in the Greenham but this is easier than that
🔦 Spotlight: Cost 500,000gns as a yearling and holds a St James's Palace entry; won by clear daylight at Lingfield in November (7f, AW) but came up well short in the Group 3 Greenham (good) for which he went off at 14-1; this is easier than that and he retains potential.

💬 Comment: Encouraging fourth at Newmarket given he never settled all that well; more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Had subsequent winners behind when doing it easily at Newmarket last October (soft) and finished close up behind Al Arbeed at the Craven meeting (good; again over 7f) despite not settling all that well; held a 2,000 Guineas entry until recently and this longer trip should be to his liking, provided he gives himself a chance to see it out.
Horse quote: 2024-10-23 at Newmarket (7f): "Treble Tree is a nice horse for the future. We'll put him away for the winter and he'll get a mile in time - Ed Crisford, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had no excuses from the front at Newmarket but that was a step up on his maiden win
🔦 Spotlight: Steps up to 1m from 7f; narrowly justified favouritism at Southwell in March (AW) and improved plenty on that form to finish third in a conditions race at the Craven meeting (good); from the front there were no excuses that day, but his trainer was optimistic about the future in his recent Stable Tour.
