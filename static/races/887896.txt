🔦 Spotlight: Versatile sort; carried first-time cheekpieces to success in a 7f handicap here in December and was a good second after a slow start in a 5f contest at Wolverhampton last month; may have found two quick runs a little too quick when well beaten there two days later; should find this trip to her liking although the cheekpieces have been discarded.
