🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bits of form suggest he's a cut above this level; below best on return; cheekpieces now
🔦 Spotlight: Threatened to be a bit better than this level on occasions last season, looking good when winning at Haydock last July (5f, good); disappointing at Southwell on his return to action last month but the run may have been needed after six months off; the fitting of cheekpieces could sharpen him up too and he's high on the list.
Horse quote: 2024-07-06 at Haydock (5f): "I thought Cloud King would enjoy a bit of dig in the ground. There's a good enough headwind out there and they went a good gallop, and looking around waiting, I thought I had everything covered - Rossa Ryan, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner; handles any ground; mixed record fresh but  booking of Oisin Murphy is a plus
🔦 Spotlight: Seven-time winner on a variety of going, one of the wins coming over C&D (firm); absent for seven months and her record fresh is mixed but the booking of Oisin Murphy suggests she'll be ready to go.
Horse quote: 2024-07-25 at Sandown (5f): "We've spent all year trying to get Lil Guff to win. Oisin had us worried halfway through. They were going too quickly and he was right to take back. He just needed the gap and you always need a bit of luck against that rail. She's won seven times so you can't complain but she needs quick ground and she's just never really had it this year. She's in at Ascot but we'll see how she is in the morning - Daniel Kubler, joint-trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Turf winner as a 2yo; yet to win a handicap but he made an encouraging seasonal return at Southwell last month; 2lb drop in the weights helps; may yet do better.

💬 Comment: Lightly raced 4yo who drops in grade and can build on her recent C&D return; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo; won a 6f fillies' novice (good ground) at Newbury as a juvenile and she made a fine seasonal return last summer when a close fourth at Sandown off a 3lb higher mark than today's; didn't run as badly as a 5l defeat might suggest here 16 days ago and she is eased in grade this time; still capable of better.

🔦 Spotlight: All six wins have come on AW but he has shown promise on turf and he couldn't be in better form, winning three of his last four starts; back up on the weights though and could be found out upped to Class 4.

💬 Comment: Promising on AW as a 3yo; ✂️ gelded/hooded for stable debut; something to prove on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Promise as a 3yo for Michael Bell, including a wide-margin maiden win at Lingfield (5f, AW); showed he could be competitive off this sort of mark in November 2023 but he has been absent since a disappointing run 500 days ago; ✂️ gelded/changed yard since and the addition of a hood looks a good move; the absence aside, the return to turf is a concern as he was well beaten in two previous attempts.

💬 Comment: 8lb lower mark on turf but recent AW efforts short of his best too; others look safer
🔦 Spotlight: Dangerous mark on his useful AW best and he has run to form on turf, for all he's 0-10 on it; he hasn't been at his best in recent outings though and others look safer; cheekpieces tried last time are quickly dispensed with.
Horse quote: 2024-07-07 at Chelmsford (AW) (5f): "The Thames Boatman needs pace in his races and looking at this race beforehand I knew he'd get that today, so that was an advantage. He's at his best when he has something to aim at, but he made life harder for himself by hanging in the last half a furlong. We do think he's a smart horse, especially on the all-weather - Finley Marsh, jockey."

💬 Comment: Condtions no problem and should step forward from this month's seasonal return
🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins to her name; dropped away on this month's return to action (5f, good to firm; first run after wind surgery) but a 2lb drop helps and she's not discounted.
Horse quote: 2024-07-06 at Leicester (6f): "Connie's Rose loves racing - there is no mare tougher.  She has a good routine at home - she doesn't do a lot or see another horse - and she's a joy to train.  I'm still undecided if she prefers 5f.  We thought she was going to be a 1m-plus horse as she was slow, green and didn't know how to gallop at all, but she got a lot quicker at home.  Would we get more improvement holding her up at 1m?  We don't know.  We may try it in future but we don't want to change anything that's working at the moment - Grace Harris, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

Horse quote: 2024-06-07 at Bath (5f): "He pinged the gates but did find the ground on the quick side, So Smart changed leads a couple of times but got away with it in the end. He likes to front-run because when he's in behind he doesn't do a whole lot, if something comes to him he goes again. He's an older horse so it's good to change things (headgear) and it's worked tonight - Kieran O'Neill, jockey, speaking to Sky Racing."
