🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Encouraging form for 🆕 new yard features a close second at Doncaster (7f); possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: Encouraging form for 🆕 new yard features a close second at Doncaster (7f, good); far from disgraced at Musselburgh last time considering the race didn't pan out favourably; possibilities.
Horse quote: 2024-06-17 at Chepstow (8f): "We were going to sell Stockpyle at the July sales, but PJ [McDonald, jockey] said something was troubling him. We took him to the vets and checked him, where we found a huge growth under his epiglottis. It was like having a cork in a bottle and he couldn't breathe, but now his confidence is being rewarded. He's been running some lovely races and has been unlucky not to win more. He's from a very good family and there's more excitement to come - William Muir, joint-trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Generally in good form on AW this year and followed his Lingfield win with a creditable fourth at Newmarket (Class 2) returned to turf; solid claims back down in grade.
Horse quote: 2022-09-03 at Ascot (7f): "I had no idea whether I'd won or not, but Urban Sprawl is game and he's in good form. He was really gunning for the line and he was able to stick his head down where it matters. He's tough - David Probert, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Six-time C&D scorer; ran respectably here on reappearance; frame possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who is a six-time C&D scorer, including twice in 2024; ran respectably here on reappearance and ties in with Pisanello on that effort; again has frame possibilities.
Horse quote: 2024-07-08 at Ripon (8f): "Garden Oasis was quickly away and I needed that as I knew there was going to be more pace in the race and, obviously drawn one, I could hold the rail if I was quick out so it was ideal, but I did have to go a little bit quicker than I wanted to into the bend. I got a bit of a breather round it but he does stay a bit further so you can stretch them and make sure they don't come past you at any speed. He's as game as they come and loves it around here - David Allan, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Could prove resurgent with Redcar reappearance under his belt
🔦 Spotlight: Productive spell featured six wins, the most recent last June; not in same form since but could prove resurgent with Redcar reappearance under his belt.
Horse quote: 2024-06-06 at Hamilton (9f): "We were up 11lb in a better grade on totally different ground so we went with an open mind again and Good Morning Alex has done it well. He's been a real surprise package from going to the all-weather in December thinking it was a last-chance saloon. He's just grown up and matured. In fairness, he was a late foal but he's improved out of all recognition. Connor [Beasley, jockey] said he wouldn't want the ground any faster than it was today so I think a lot will depend on the weather as to where we go. This was very much the target - Nicola Barron, joint-trainer."

I think the cheekpieces have helped him a lot because he hit the front at York and then just shut down. It's just made him focus. He's made hard work of it on what he does at home. I have a horse, Scottish Summit, rated 91 and this fella will kick him into touch without even coming off the bridle - Geoff Harker, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Multiple winner down the years but was soundly beaten on reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner down the years but was soundly beaten on reappearance and thus appears to have a weaker chance than fellow 10yo Garden Oasis.
Horse quote: 2022-10-26 at Nottingham (8.5f): "It felt like the leader was getting away but Poet's Dawn has a big heart and he dug deep. He's a grand horse to have in the yard, he goes on any ground and very versatile - David Allan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last seven wins over hurdles; recent AW form is unconvincing
🔦 Spotlight: Last seven wins over hurdles; recent AW form is unconvincing; on a handy mark returned to turf but seems far from certain to take advantage.
Horse quote: 2024-09-22 at Plumpton (16f): "I thought the ground would be on the soft side for Enthused as he likes it rattling but fair play to him and he only ran on the Flat a week ago. Alex Chadwick, jockey, talking to Sky Sports Racing."
