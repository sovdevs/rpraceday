🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Outran odds of 28-1 on debut in Punchestown Festival bumper behind two subsequent winners
🔦 Spotlight: Yard have had a bumper winner this season and this son of Authorized outran odds of 28-1 when third of 17 in a Punchestown Festival bumper on debut; that form has worked out nicely (runner-up was DRF winner Colcannon); different conditions here but his half-brothers handle testing ground and he's interesting on seasonal debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Yard have had a bumper winner this season and this son of Authorized outran odds of 28-1 when third of 17 in a Punchestown Festival bumper on debut; that form has worked out nicely (runner-up was DRF winner Colcannon); different conditions here but his half-brothers handle testing ground and he's interesting on seasonal debut.

💬 Comment: Point winner; 2nd in Exeter bumper and left low-key yard debut behind with C&D 4th since
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner who only found one too good in an Exeter bumper and left his low-key yard debut behind when fourth in a C&D bumper last month; needs to build on that.
