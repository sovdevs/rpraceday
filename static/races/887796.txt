💬 Comment: Outran odds of 28-1 on debut in Punchestown Festival bumper behind two subsequent winners
🔦 Spotlight: Yard have had a bumper winner this season and this son of Authorized outran odds of 28-1 when third of 17 in a Punchestown Festival bumper on debut; that form has worked out nicely (runner-up was DRF winner Colcannon); different conditions here but his half-brothers handle testing ground and he's interesting on seasonal debut.

💬 Comment: Only 8s for Windsor debut when fifth of 10; pedigree suggests he may want a bit further
🔦 Spotlight: Only 8-1 for a soft ground Windsor bumper last month and was fifth of 10, beaten 14l; his pedigree suggests he may be one for longer distances but not discounted; wears first-time hood.
