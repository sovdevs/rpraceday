💬 Comment: Outran odds of 28-1 on debut in Punchestown Festival bumper behind two subsequent winners
🔦 Spotlight: Yard have had a bumper winner this season and this son of Authorized outran odds of 28-1 when third of 17 in a Punchestown Festival bumper on debut; that form has worked out nicely (runner-up was DRF winner Colcannon); different conditions here but his half-brothers handle testing ground and he's interesting on seasonal debut.
