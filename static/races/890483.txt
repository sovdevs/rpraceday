🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner in September and he won Stratford seller latest; respected back in handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Not the force of old but he won a handicap here (2m1f, good to soft) in September and got back on the scoresheet at Stratford (2m2f, good) two weeks ago; that was at odds-on in a seller but he was bought in for £8,400 and he's respected back in handicap.
Horse quote: 2024-09-24 at Fontwell (17.5f): "Honneur d'Ajonc is quite quirky and it's taken a while to get him where he is today. He doesn't like being crowded and didn't enjoy being boxed in on the rails at Perth last time. Today he's had the dream run round - Alex Chadwick, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner who was disappointing here last time but she still has potential over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Won on handicap debut over C&D (good to soft) in October; good placed efforts in next two runs including a close third at Ludlow, but she was disappointing back at this track (2m6f, soft) last time; bit to prove again after that but she still has potential over hurdles and this drop back in trip looks a good move.
