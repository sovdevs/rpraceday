🔦 Spotlight: Novice who won two handicaps in a row in December (2m3f, soft) before creditable second of three in Grade 2 novice at Windsor (3m, soft) last month, when a bad mistake three out was costly; he's unraced on the forecast good ground and has a lofty mark now back in a handicap, but this 7yo is clearly 📈 progressive and it will be no surprise if he plays a leading role.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 over hurdles but won his first two chase starts last month (3m/3m2f, soft/heavy) before good second at Wincanton (3m2f, good to soft) last time; goes up in grade today and could do with jumping better than on his latest start, but he's 🚀 open to further improvement if finding greater fluency.

🔦 Spotlight: Trainer's horses often improve as they go up in trip and this 3m point winner is just 1lb higher than when winning over 2m4f at Musselburgh last February; however, he hasn't hit the same heights this season and hasn't shaped as though the step up in distance will be an obvious plus.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running well this season at up to 3m4f; a stiffer test of stamina is probably preferable
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Fontwell (3m3f, good) in November then a fair third the last twice (3m4f/3m, soft/good); early unseat at Plumpton 12 days ago; finished second over C&D last May but in a less competitive race than this and a stiffer test of stamina is probably preferable.
