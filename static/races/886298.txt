🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Classy on Flat; leading form claims after Ascot second over hurdles, when he didn't settle
🔦 Spotlight: Classy on the Flat, finishing fifth in the French Derby and fourth in King Edward VII at Royal Ascot; left France for 520,000euros in October and, despite racing far too freely, he briefly asked a question of top prospect Lulamba on hurdling debut at Ascot (1m7f, good) five weeks ago; leading form claims on that and a more settled performance would surely help him no end.

🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful for 1m4f/1m6f wins on Flat for previous yard; shaped encouragingly at Ascot (albeit about 17l behind Mondo Man) on hurdling debut and built on that with a strong late bid to register Listed win at Musselburgh (1m7f, good to soft) three weeks ago; this demands more but he's promising.
