💬 Comment: 3-49 though has won over C&D; 13lb below his last winning mark but opposable from his draw
🔦 Spotlight: Far from solid with a record of 3-49 albeit one of his wins came over C&D; 13lb below his last winning mark and has run well on turf the last twice, but still looks opposable from his draw.
