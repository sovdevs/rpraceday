🔦 Spotlight: Returned to the Flat for 🆕 new yard with an emphatic win at Wolverhampton (1m6f) last month and he defied a big rise in mark when following ⬆️ up in class 2 at Newcastle (2m); up another 4lb but he travelled smoothly for a long way last time and is still 🔍 unexposed as a stayer; leading contender.

🔦 Spotlight: Won both his turf starts early last year (1m2f/1m3f); disappointing favourite at Southwell on his comeback last month but he ran well to finish a close fourth when upped to 2m at Kempton last time; was strong at the finish in that tactical race and he should have more to offer in staying handicaps; interesting contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over hurdles in November and he looks interesting back on Flat for top Irish trainer
🔦 Spotlight: Only 3lb higher than for his near-miss at Chester (2m, soft) in September and he readily made all over hurdles at Sedgefield (2m1f novice) in his final run last year; that latest form is working out very well and he looks interesting back in this sphere for top Irish trainer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Turned things around when runner-up off reduced mark at Newcastle last time; dangerous
🔦 Spotlight: 7yo who was useful in his prime but all of his three wins were in 2021; struggled in his first four runs after a long absence but his second at Newcastle (2m, Tapeta) two weeks ago was much more like it; has claims if he can build on that and he's effective on Polytrack.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four hurdle wins but he's 1-7 on Flat and was well held on Dundalk return; down the list
🔦 Spotlight: Four wins from ten starts over hurdles but he's 1-7 on the Flat and was a well-held fifth of six at Dundalk (2m, AW) on his recent return; may have needed that run but this looks a tougher assignment and others are preferred.
