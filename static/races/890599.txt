🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has the best form claims and the return of a hood could be significant (keen last time)
🔦 Spotlight: 0-8 over hurdles but his second in a Taunton handicap (2m, soft) reads extremely well in today's company and he was a bit too free when turned over at short odds in a maiden at Fontwell; has the best form claims and the return of a hood could be significant.
