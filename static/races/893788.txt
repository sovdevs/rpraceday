🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hasn't been beaten far in three starts this year but needs a strong pace to show his best
🔦 Spotlight: Last win came at Doncaster last July off 5lb higher mark; hasn't been beaten far in three starts this year but needs a strong pace in order to utilise his finishing kick; not out of this on a career-low mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Prolific winner but hasn't won on turf since August 2023; hasn't been beaten far on last two starts and has dropped to his lowest mark, so cannot be discounted.
Horse quote: 2023-11-02 at Wolverhampton (AW) (6f): "Muscika is a lovely old boy. The last day at Epsom went really well and today went the same, he jumped out and has a nice gate speed, which is good from a low draw here. We went a nice enough gallop but I didn't have to use too much petrol and he travelled into it well. He's really found his form again - Cieren Fallon, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."
