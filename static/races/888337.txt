🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sets the standard on his promising effort at Naas and he's a 🔥 big player for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who went very close on the Flat at Fairyhouse (1m4f, good) for Jim Bolger last summer; took a heavy fall on hurdling debut in December but he returned to this sphere with a keeping-on sixth of 16 in Naas maiden (2m, soft to heavy) in January; sets the standard on that promising effort and he should have more to offer for 🆕 new yard; 🔥 big player.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in four of her eight runs over hurdles and she's respected back from another break
🔦 Spotlight: Dual winner at around 1m6f on the Flat at Chelmsford (AW); 0-8 over hurdles but she's finished runner-up three times and was a close third in a Perth maiden (2m, good) when last seen in September; that form has been boosted by the second and fourth since and she's respected back from another break.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fairly useful on Flat and 🔍 unexposed over hurdles but he was tailed off at Carlisle latest
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful Flat racer who signed off for David O'Meara with 1m2f AW win in October; encouraging third on hurdling/stable debut here (1m7f, good to soft) last month but he struggled at Carlisle 12 days ago and has something to prove after that heavy defeat.
