🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Seven hurdle wins include one over C&D; should be fine on good ground; player
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful dual-purpose performer whose seven hurdle wins include one over C&D; 4lb higher than when winning at Haydock (2m, soft) in December, but that was a better race than this one; shouldn't have an issue with good ground and a player.

🔦 Spotlight: 1-20 under rules and has endured a couple of lengthy absences in recent years, but he comes into this off the back of a couple of solid placed efforts at Warwick (2m, soft); acts on good ground as well and cannot be dismissed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two hurdle wins late last year including over C&D, but ran poorly last time
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice from the front over hurdles on good to soft ground late last year including over C&D; out of his depth in a Listed contest at Huntingdon (2m4f, good to soft) last month, but it was still an uninspiring performance and he needs to bounce back; tongue-tie removed after one use.

🔦 Spotlight: Initially did well over hurdles in the 2022/23 season and, having gone missing for 650 days, his two placed efforts late last year suggested the ability remained; ran poorly at Taunton (2m, soft) last month, but the return to good ground should suit; can take a keen hold.
