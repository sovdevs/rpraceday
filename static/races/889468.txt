🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Far from discredited when bidding for a second Stayers' Hurdle win; again top on ratings
🔦 Spotlight: Leading stayer whose success in the 2024 Stayers' Hurdle (soft) was the middle leg of a Grade 1 hat-trick; beaten favourite back at Cheltenham (good to soft) last month when bidding to defend his crown but far from discredited in finishing a clear second; again top on ratings.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Far from discredited when bidding for a second Stayers' Hurdle win; again top on ratings
🔦 Spotlight: Leading stayer whose success in the 2024 Stayers' Hurdle (soft) was the middle leg of a Grade 1 hat-trick; beaten favourite back at Cheltenham (good to soft) last month when bidding to defend his crown but far from discredited in finishing a clear second; again top on ratings.
