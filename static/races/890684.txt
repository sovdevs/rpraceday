🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improving at 6f, well on top the last twice despite hanging left; can rate higher still
🔦 Spotlight: The winner of his last three runs over 6f (also ran well over 5f in November), including C&D in January and at Lingfield seven weeks ago; has hung left in the closing stages for both those victories but was well on top at the finish on each occasion; another 6lb rise to contend with but he's on the up and has to enter the reckoning.
Horse quote: 2025-02-28 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "We didn't expect So Darn Hot to win like that. He was essentially carrying 12lb more than last time and I wasn't sure Lingfield would suit him. He didn't have any cover, which wasn't ideal, but he's by Too Darn Hot and his progeny love a good fight - Kevin Philippart De Foy, trainer."

💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed colt who won easily here last month; doubt we've seen the best of him yet
🔦 Spotlight: Promising second to Megaphone on his Kempton debut in January and he's won both starts since, defying a penalty in fine style over C&D last month; that race was slowly run to halfway but he picked up strongly in the manner of one with plenty more to offer; needs to improve again to defy his opening mark but that would appear likely; stable, who have won the last two renewals, run three here.

💬 Comment: Lingfield win (6f) in January and ran well behind a useful 3yo last time; 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in all three runs this winter, winning at Lingfield in January (6f) and picked off late back there last month; had the run of that novice event but the winner has since finished fourth in the Greenham; should still have more to offer.
Horse quote: 2025-01-24 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "I've always liked Hello Zaman a lot. He had a few little babyish niggles as a two-year-old, which is why he didn't appear until December and he was very green on debut. Thankfully, he showed a bit more like what we think of him there. He was still a bit green, so I'd hope he can step forward again and be quite smart in time. I think he'll be a sprinter being by Hello Youmzain, his last furlong was his best, so I think six furlongs will be his trip - James Tate, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Confirmed the promise of November's debut third to Good Banter when running away with a Southwell novice one month later; finished behind Zaman at Lingfield last month, however, and others are more appealing.
Horse quote: 2024-12-19 at Southwell (AW) (6f): "It was a lovely performance. Don Pacifico put that experience at Wolverhampton to good use and I was very comfortable once I got him relaxed and in a rhythm. He's still inexperienced and had a look around in the straight so hopefully there's more to come- Jack Mitchell, jockey, speaking on Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Two AW wins, including C&D, as a 2yo; placed behind reopposing rivals the last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Two AW wins as a 2yo, including C&D, and he has finished third behind reopposing rivals on his last two starts; a career best is required to overcome this mark.
Horse quote: 2024-08-02 at Newcastle (AW) (6f): "I've always liked Cyclonite, but he's just taken a while to get going and learn the game. I think he's done it a bit easier than it looked, to be honest. He's a nice-looking colt and he's a May foal, so he's definitely one who will keep on improving. I did think he was ready to go and win earlier on in the season, but things just didn't go his way for whatever reason - James Ferguson, trainer."

💬 Comment: Two 6f Dundalk wins as a 2yo; stiff task on return; improvement required on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Prominent racer who won twice at Dundalk (6f) in the latter part of 2024; faced a stiff task at Dundalk five weeks ago and dropped away in the straight; wouldn't look obviously well treated for his handicap debut.
Horse quote: 2024-10-30 at Dundalk (AW) (6f): "We probably actually expected that two runs ago on his first start as Dark Ace showed us plenty at home, but the first day he ran a bit free and things didn't go to plan. We worked him up here last week on the surface and he worked well - Adam Caffrey, jockey, talking to Racing TV."
