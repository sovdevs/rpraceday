💬 Comment: Rated 85, well-bred and should strip fitter for Naas run last month, the one to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Rated 85 after four maiden runs; should strip fitter for his comeback at Naas (7f, soft to heavy) last month when his jockey lost an iron close to home; well-bred Lope De Vega colt sets a solid standard and looks the one to beat.
