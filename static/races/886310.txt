💬 Comment: Remains on a good mark and has a lot less to prove than many of these
🔦 Spotlight: His defeat of Double Oban at Wetherby on Boxing Day now reads really well and he's since finished right on the scene in two visits here; remains on a good mark and has a lot less to prove than many of these; trip/ground ideal.
