💬 Comment: Beaten fav on stable debut last month (6f) but matched Irish form; ✂️ gelded since; solid
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in two runs in Ireland prior to a 40,000gns sale in January; odds-on favourite for his stable debut at Newcastle (6f) last month but he was picked off late having made the running; been ✂️ gelded since and this could prove his optimum trip; sets a clear standard.
