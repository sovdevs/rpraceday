🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Held on well for small-field win at Newcastle this month and ran well in defeat soon after
🔦 Spotlight: Held on well to beat three rivals under Pippa Brown at Newcastle (2m4f, good) this month, her eighth start over fences, and ran at least as well when close second at Sedgefield (2m3f, good) six days later; evidently in very good nick; might be the answer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Only minor promise in three novice/maiden hurdles; now chasing on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Showed nothing more than minor promise when beaten 30l+ in three maiden/novice hurdles (2m-2m4f) during the winter and seems rather harshly treated for this handicap debut but, nevetheless, he's open to significant improvement if he takes well to fences.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Regressive 12yo who is having a disappointing campaign; needs to turn a corner
🔦 Spotlight: Useful in his prime but long in the tooth now and this season has been disappointing; travelled well to a point in first-time cheekpieces at Ludlow (2m4f, good to soft) in December but didn't find much when the chips were down; no headgear today; needs four-month break to have done him good.
Horse quote: 2023-11-08 at Musselburgh (16f): "I thought Cracking Destiny would run well but I didn't think he had that in him. Craig said they went quick early on and it played to his strengths, as he sits off the pace and needs them to go fast over two miles - Ewan Whillans, trainer, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Patently not the force of old but positives can be drawn from his latest run; new headgear
🔦 Spotlight: Useful over several seasons when trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies; signed off for him with some below-par runs in the autumn and made low-key start for new stable this year but significant positives can be drawn from his run in refitted cheekpieces at Sedgefield (3m2f, good) last month and he has possibilities here if combination of drop back in trip and first-time visor pays dividends.
