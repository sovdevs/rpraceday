💬 Comment: Excellent second in an Aintree handicap; raised in grade but he's dangerously 🔍 unexposed
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive in France (including on heavy ground); very disappointing favourite in the Martin Pipe at Cheltenham but proved that form all wrong with an excellent effort in a 2m4f handicap at Aintree, where he was closing in on one who got first run; raised in grade but he's dangerously 🔍 unexposed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Penalised for winning the Grade 2 Boyne Hurdle; has since disappointed at Cheltenham
🔦 Spotlight: None too consistent and had an off-day when pulled up in the Coral Cup; however, he's very smart when on his game and it was bordering on a career best when easily winning the Grade 2 Boyne Hurdle at Navan the time before; could go well despite an unwelcome penalty, which he didn't have when falling in this last year (running well at the time).
Horse quote: 2025-02-09 at Navan (22f): "Maxxum had a good run at Gowran over 3m last time when he didn't get home. We thought dropping back to this trip would work well if he got a soft enough lead. Danny (Gilligan) was able to get a breather into him at the right time and he did it well. He'll go for the Coral Cup now - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has flashes of smart form but has been below that in her last two appearances
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in the 2023 Triumph; finished behind Lantry Lady in last season's Grade 1 Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham and was out the back when falling three out in last month's renewal; only third in a Listed hurdle at Warwick the time before, so current wellbeing is an issue.
Horse quote: 2023-05-21 at Auteuil (19.5f): "We all love a filly who's able to come through a whole season and at the very end put in probably her best performance. Danny thought Gala Marceau would be one who would suit the Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham next season - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fourth in a Grade 1 last season and didn't take to chasing on her reappearance
🔦 Spotlight: Won the Grade 3 Red Mills Hurdle on just her second career start and highly tried in Grade 1s afterwards, finishing a good fourth to Lossiemouth in the 2m4f mares' race at Cheltenham last season; jumping failed to stand the test on her chase debut and she's respected back in this scene, especially as she's so lightly raced.
Horse quote: 2024-03-12 at Cheltenham (20f): "Langtry Lady is the one for the future, definitely. That was only her third start and Jack (Kennedy) said she just got a little bit lost at the start. She's probably a three-mile mare in time, so I'm delighted - Henry de Bromhead, trainer."

💬 Comment: Classy mare and admirably consistent until disappointing at the Cheltenham Festival
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time winner over hurdles and admirably consistent until weakening out of contention behind Lossiemouth at Cheltenham last month (2m4f, good to soft; 16-1); she's better than that and needs considering with no ground/trip issues.
Horse quote: 2024-11-02 at Down Royal (17f): "Kala Conti is not a bad filly and had graded form last year. I thought she might need the run today. She's a good filly - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran his usual honest race to be fifth in the Coral Cup; sure to give his running
🔦 Spotlight: Has a poor strike-rate but he's been a grand servant to his connections and ran his usual honest race to be fifth in the Coral Cup; won't do down without a fight and testing ground doesn't faze him.
Horse quote: 2021-10-23 at Galway (16.5f): "We knew before the race we'd have to make the running and I wasn't really worried about that but it is a relief more than anything. There was so much expectation riding on Colonel Mustard to nail the maiden and get it done and he has. It will give him huge confidence and I think we now have a good bar from what he did last season. I hope we have a lot to look forward to now and I'd like to take him to Cheltenham in three weeks for the Supreme Novices Trial because I think it'll be good to get there and see how he travels - Lorna Fowler, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Absent since finishing fourth in what's turned out a good renewal of last season's Albert Bartlett (3m), which was a good effort for one whose pedigree hardly screams stamina; raw ability is much respected but this is a big ask after so long on the sidelines.
Horse quote: 2024-01-24 at Fairyhouse (20f): "Spread Boss Ted just missed the last and was hard to get going again on that ground. He closed up well when I asked him and he would have been an impressive winner but for the last - Paul Townend, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has become lethargic in his recent races; in new blinkers when ninth in the Coral Cup
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper/maiden winner; has become rather disappointing given his initial promise and lethargic in recent races, running on all too late in the day when ninth in the Coral Cup last time (first-time blinkers); might not be good enough even if putting it all in.
Horse quote: 2024-01-23 at Down Royal (17f): "Staffordshire Knot is a bit green, but I'd say he would be better in a better race. It was a nice performance and hopefully can progress. The ground is very dead, so it is testing. He went away through it and did it well - Jack Kennedy, rider"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful gelding but likely placed at best here unless the blinkers can trigger something
🔦 Spotlight: Has only won a couple of minor hurdles but had raised his game in defeat this season until finishing only midfield in the Coral Cup; likely placed at best here unless the first-time blinkers can trigger something; the ground will be fine.
Horse quote: 2024-02-10 at Naas (16f): "Eagle Fang has bumped into some smart horses. He would want it soft and I would like to see some rain but the Boodles has been the plan for some time - Gary Bannon, assistant trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: For an 11yo he ran a cracker to be seventh in the Coral Cup but then finished well behind Kopeck De Mee at Aintree; not hard to look elsewhere.
Horse quote: 2024-11-02 at Wetherby (24f): "Beacon Edge is a lovely genuine horse, he runs his race every time and I couldn't have been more happy with the way he did it there.  Small-runner fields can get quite tactical, we picked it up turning into the straight and I didn't want to be too far away because I knew my lad stays. He's done it well - Danny Gilligan, jockey."
