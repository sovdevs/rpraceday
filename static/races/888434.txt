🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second at Kempton on last month's debut (1m; odds-on fav); capable of better; contender
🔦 Spotlight: Sent off the odds-on favourite for his Kempton debut last month (1m) but less professional than the winner when coming under pressure and couldn't claw back the deficit; open to improvement but it will be needed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy win in a weak race on recent debut (7f); bred to be useful but has to concede weight
🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably on top at the finish on his Newcastle debut (7f) 16 days ago having initially looked green when asked for his effort; that form nothing special and he has to concede a penalty to some useful opponents so he will need a big step forward today; given his pedigree that's not out of the question.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two promising runs as a 2yo, including 1m on AW; may not thrive until tackling 1m2f+
🔦 Spotlight: Promise in both runs last autumn, improving on his debut effort (7f, good to firm) when third of nine at Kempton one month later (1m, AW); the pair to beat him haven't tested the form yet but those in behind have fared quite well and he remains capable of better; bred to stay middle distances.
