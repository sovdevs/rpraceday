🔦 Spotlight: Won a bumper and maiden hurdle in spring 2023; has gradually worked his way back into form this winter following a long absence and he was a fair third at Doncaster (2m3f, good) last month; he was placed in a 3m point and there's stamina in his pedigree, so this step up in trip may suit.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: His mark continues to fall but tailed off last time and has something to prove
🔦 Spotlight: His mark continues to fall and he showed some spark when fifth at Ludlow in December; however, he's since been tailed off back there and this regressive 10yo is back to having something to prove.
