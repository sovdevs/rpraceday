🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French recruit who is much improved for his current yard since sent chasing this term, going in at Ascot (2m2f) before posting an excellent second of nine in 2m3f handicap at Doncaster last time; that form has been franked so he's a 🔥 big player off an unchanged mark.

🔦 Spotlight: Ex-French recruit who is much improved for his current yard since sent chasing this term, going in at Ascot (2m2f) before posting an excellent second of nine in 2m3f handicap at Doncaster last time; that form has been franked so he's a 🔥 big player off an unchanged mark.
