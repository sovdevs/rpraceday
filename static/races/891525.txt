🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning return at Nottingham (about 1m); up 3lb; should give it good shot from rail draw
🔦 Spotlight: Won 7f seller on second run, also two narrow defeats in novice races in August; returned with a good winning effort at Nottingham (about 1m, good) where she had the lead 3f out and never really looked like giving it up; raised 3lb; can give it a good shot from the rail draw back at 7f.
Horse quote: 2024-06-14 at Chester (7f): "Manila Thriller is a nice, big filly who was green first time out like some of mine can be, but we felt she could improve. It was a really nice pot and it was better than winning any novice. On a more conventional track she'll have a bit more speed, but she should hopefully be a nice filly to win a couple of novices with - Jack Channon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising 2yo; narrow 7f winner on AW in December; can improve now handicapping
🔦 Spotlight: Useful pedigree; ran green but clear evidence of ability on Newmarket debut which was more than confirmed when getting the upper hand late on Wolverhampton AW (7f) from a subsequent winner; should be a nice prospect for handicaps; yard in form.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: All races at 6f; lost out after a good battle on AW handicap debut; bred to stay 7f
🔦 Spotlight: All races at 6f, ready winner of an AW novice on second start and she didn't go down without a fight, despite being carried across the track, on handicap debut at Newcastle in March; good chance of staying the extra furlong on pedigree; on the premises now switched to turf.

🔦 Spotlight: Seemingly improved for the step up to 1m and switch to AW for her win at Kempton on third start and although the race fell her way she looks likely to go on from that in handicaps.

💬 Comment: Off since October but had a good year in 2024, adding two more 7f wins; can go well fresh
🔦 Spotlight: Has been off since October but she had a good season in 2024, adding two more 7f wins (good to firm and good to soft) and is quite capable of going well fresh; not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2024-06-16 at Thirsk (7f): "Mereside Diva is improving all the time and thriving. She's been progressing nicely since stepping up to seven furlongs. When she was still a bit raw, you'd go for her and she'd prick her ears and have a look, but she's really game now and sticking to her task well - Callum Rodriguez, speaking to ITV Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful winning debut form (7f, good to firm); down the field on yard debut; do better here
🔦 Spotlight: Beat a useful one when making winning debut at Lingfield (7f, good to firm) last May, then struck into when well beaten in Listed company; this mark within reach on AW form and is better than a recent Southwell defeat for 🆕 new yard suggests (hampered, then eased over 1m); of interest.

💬 Comment: Won 6f maiden at Navan; highly tried after; makes handicap/yard debut after a break
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of 6f maiden at Navan in September; sold 80,000gns soon after but she fell well short when highly tried in the autumn; this might be needed on yard/handicap debut back from a break.
Horse quote: 2024-09-07 at Navan (6f): "Actin Like A Diva had a very good run at Cork first time, back on good ground today there was plenty of pace and she stayed well. If she hadn't been well beaten at Dundalk she never would have been 50-1 - Nathan Crosse, rider."
