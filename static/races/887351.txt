üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Easy winner of the Eider three weeks ago off 10lb lower; very üîç unexposed as a stayer
üî¶ Spotlight: Kicked off over fences at 2m and hadn't won past 2m4f until putting that right on his first foray beyond 3m in the Eider at Newcastle (4m1f, good to soft), which he won eased down by some 16l; that was never in doubt from a good way from home and the 10lb rise is fully warranted; must have a chance of following up if he can perform to the same level three weeks on.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Out-and-out stayer built to carry the weight but all his best form is in the mud
üî¶ Spotlight: A 9yo with just ten runs behind him; an out-and-out galloper who is made for a race of this nature and a 3lb rise for his latest Haydock win in this new aids combination (3m1f, soft; stays further) seems lenient; built to carry the 12st (though no horse has defied top weight since Bonanza Boy in 1991) but the glaring concern is that all his best form is in the mud, which he won't be getting here.

üí¨ Comment: Would prefer softer ground ideally but lots to like otherwise after the season he's had
üî¶ Spotlight: Has won five of his last eight races and career bests the last twice in winning the Welsh National (3m6f, soft) and finishing a 12l third at Haydock (3m4f, good to soft; behind Apple Away but ahead of Galia Des Liteaux); he was 6lb out of the weights last time and returns to his correct mark here; would prefer softer ground ideally but lots to like otherwise.

üí¨ Comment: Recent wins have been at 3m1f/3m4f and he's üîç unexposed as a stayer; lightly weighted
üî¶ Spotlight: For a long time he plied his trade over much shorter distances; it was his first run beyond 2m6f when winning a 3m1f handicap at Plumpton in January and he followed up in their Sussex National over 3m4f (again soft); it was likeable in how he wanted that so badly and all of a sudden he's a young stayer on the upgrade; needs respecting off his light weight.

üí¨ Comment: Lightly raced chaser; interesting if finding some rhythm and staying okay in new blinkers
üî¶ Spotlight: Won a 3m point and two of his hurdle wins were at that sort of trip; lightly raced over fences but that brings potential into the equation and he was only beaten 4l in a 3m Grade 2 on his chase debut in December; fell next time and then ran moderately in a Newbury handicap, but could easily threaten if finding some rhythm and seeing out the trip on his first taste of a National; as with stablemate Iron Bridge, blinkers are applied for the first time.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: Last year's Grand National 8th; fair run last time and she's easing in the weights
üî¶ Spotlight: Grade 2-winning chaser and respectable eighth (faded) in last year's Grand National; hasn't kicked on from a good first run of the season that reads well but she's easing in the weights and ran better at Haydock last time (3m4f, good to soft) than a 25l defeat may imply as she made a late mistake; her stamina for this far isn't guaranteed but interesting otherwise; tongue-tie joins her regular cheekpieces.

üî¶ Spotlight: In two of his last four races he was pulled up in this last year and again in the Welsh National in December when amongst the favourites on both occasions; very capable stayer when on his game, though, and looked set for a good season when third to Val Dancer on his Carlisle reappearance (3m2f, good to soft); has run well here before and could yet have his day in the sun; makes the shortlist in first-time blinkers.

üî¶ Spotlight: Left the impression that he wanted even further than the extended 3m7f when plodding on for second in the Edinburgh National (good to soft) and didn't get chance to show what he could do in the 4m1f Eider, having unseated seven fences out; Irish raider who could run well at lengthy odds.
