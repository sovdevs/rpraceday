🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy winner of the Eider three weeks ago off 10lb lower; very 🔍 unexposed as a stayer
🔦 Spotlight: Kicked off over fences at 2m and hadn't won past 2m4f until putting that right on his first foray beyond 3m in the Eider at Newcastle (4m1f, good to soft), which he won eased down by some 16l; that was never in doubt from a good way from home and the 10lb rise is fully warranted; must have a chance of following up if he can perform to the same level three weeks on.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out-and-out stayer built to carry the weight but all his best form is in the mud
🔦 Spotlight: A 9yo with just ten runs behind him; an out-and-out galloper who is made for a race of this nature and a 3lb rise for his latest Haydock win in this new aids combination (3m1f, soft; stays further) seems lenient; built to carry the 12st (though no horse has defied top weight since Bonanza Boy in 1991) but the glaring concern is that all his best form is in the mud, which he won't be getting here.

💬 Comment: Improving and if his stamina reserves can stretch this far then he might not be far away
🔦 Spotlight: ⬆️ up in class and up in trip (by some way) having never gone beyond an extended 3m; however, he's got low mileage as a chaser and won eased down last time at Carlisle (good to soft); handicapper saw fit to raise him 9lb for that but if his stamina reserves can stretch this far then he might not be far away.

🔦 Spotlight: Hurdling this season with mixed fortunes before his return to fences at Punchestown (3m3f, soft), where he was well on top in the finish to beat 16 rivals in a valuable race on his handicap debut in this discipline; they've probably only scratched the surface with him as a staying chaser but his apparent preference for the mud tempers enthusiasm in him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Recent wins have been at 3m1f/3m4f and he's 🔍 unexposed as a stayer; lightly weighted
🔦 Spotlight: For a long time he plied his trade over much shorter distances; it was his first run beyond 2m6f when winning a 3m1f handicap at Plumpton in January and he followed up in their Sussex National over 3m4f (again soft); it was likeable in how he wanted that so badly and all of a sudden he's a young stayer on the upgrade; needs respecting off his light weight.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced chaser; interesting if finding some rhythm and staying okay in new blinkers
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 3m point and two of his hurdle wins were at that sort of trip; lightly raced over fences but that brings potential into the equation and he was only beaten 4l in a 3m Grade 2 on his chase debut in December; fell next time and then ran moderately in a Newbury handicap, but could easily threaten if finding some rhythm and seeing out the trip on his first taste of a National; as with stablemate Iron Bridge, blinkers are applied for the first time.

🔦 Spotlight: Completed a four-timer last season when overcoming a serious late mistake to win the Eider at Newcastle (4m1f, heavy; 4lb lower); signs of rediscovering some form when running well for a long way in the Edinburgh National (3m7f, good to soft) and he was widely fancied to win a second Eider last month only to get loose before the start and be withdrawn; has a chance.

💬 Comment: Last year's Grand National 8th; fair run last time and she's easing in the weights
🔦 Spotlight: Grade 2-winning chaser and respectable eighth (faded) in last year's Grand National; hasn't kicked on from a good first run of the season that reads well but she's easing in the weights and ran better at Haydock last time (3m4f, good to soft) than a 25l defeat may imply as she made a late mistake; her stamina for this far isn't guaranteed but interesting otherwise; tongue-tie joins her regular cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has his off days but a smart stayer who does have form here; tries blinkers
🔦 Spotlight: In two of his last four races he was pulled up in this last year and again in the Welsh National in December when amongst the favourites on both occasions; very capable stayer when on his game, though, and looked set for a good season when third to Val Dancer on his Carlisle reappearance (3m2f, good to soft); has run well here before and could yet have his day in the sun; makes the shortlist in first-time blinkers.

🔦 Spotlight: Has won two of his six chase starts but was beaten off this mark in a six-runner handicap at Wincanton last time when in the new cheekpieces (3m1f, heavy); unraced beyond that trip but he's one who doesn't do much in a hurry and today's marathon trip could be up his street.

💬 Comment: Inconsistent but a 3m3f winner and ran well in the Welsh National until clouting four out
🔦 Spotlight: None too consistent and was well held when falling at Punchestown last time in the race won by stablemate Fortunedefortunata; however, he does have a valuable staying 3m3f handicap in the bag and was looking threatening in the Welsh National in December until he clouted four out (in first-time blinkers that have been retained since); his best days have been on slow ground.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Former winner of Warwick's big staying chase but she's having a disappointing season
🔦 Spotlight: Only 2lb higher than when winning Warwick's Classic Chase (3m5f, soft) 14 months ago but her third at Hereford just before Christmas is her only effort of note this campaign and her jumping left a lot to be desired last time when tried in cheekpieces (soon discarded); others safer.
