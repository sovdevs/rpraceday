🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Down the field at Cheltenham, every chance on the strength of his Naas win in February
🔦 Spotlight: Remote fourth to Its On The Line at Punchestown last May; raised his game this season, notably when beating Ontheropes and Its On The Line at Naas (3m1f, soft), with Big Interest fourth; failed to make his presence felt in the St James's Place at Cheltenham, though stayed on late from well off the pace; could be a different proposition now.
Horse quote: 2025-02-08 at Naas (25f): "Ryehill took a bit of time because he is so big, but he has strengthened up well and seems to keep improving. He's a nice horse to take to Cheltenham, with hopefully an each-way squeak. He likes soft ground and the trip will be no trouble to him - Ross O'Sullivan, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has failed to build on a fine Down Royal win in December but remains a promising sort
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner last season; beat leading hunter chaser Its On The Line on his rules' debut at Down Royal in December on good-to-yielding; much less effective on soft when a moderate fourth behind Ryehill at Naas; lost a shoe when pulled up in the Tetratema at Gowran; found the trip (below 2m4f) inadequate at Down Royal last month; remains a promising sort

🔦 Spotlight: Unbeaten in two bumpers, useful hurdler-chaser at his best; needs to step up on the form of hunters' chase outings at Haydock and Gowran; chased home prolific winner Winged Leader at Portrush a month ago.
Horse quote: 2022-01-02 at Naas (20f): "Hollow Games ran very well because he got stopped in his run a couple of times and he probably should have been second. He'll be a nice horse - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Former Troytown winner, has become regressive, plenty to prove, cheekpieces tried now
🔦 Spotlight: Very smart in his prime for Gordon Elliott, including winning 2021 Troytown off 145; regressed last year, runner-up in Bandon open last month; plenty to prove, cheekpieces tried now.
Horse quote: 2021-11-21 at Navan (24f): "I think the National Hunt Chase could be written all over Run Wild Fred. Michael [O'Leary] might have different ideas, and it's a long time from here to March, but I think the National Hunt Chase is made for him and I'm a big believer in going for the race you think you can win - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Winner of 14 races under rules; veteran has failed to score in 12 starts in point-to-points since last October.
Horse quote: 2021-08-02 at Cork (24f): "Go Another One won this last year when he was well in, he wasn't so well in this year so he's certainly not getting any worse! He is still really enthusiastic and he was probably the last horse to pull up - John McConnell, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of form during the autumn points campaign, no encouragement from recent form
🔦 Spotlight: Out of form in a busy spell during the autumn points campaign; last of six in a hunters' chase at Thurles in January; again in rear at Belharbour; no encouragement from his two most recent starts.
Horse quote: 2022-02-24 at Thurles (25f): "Balkito has been dropped in to his class today. Chasing is his game and Jack got him into a great rhythm. If the handicapper isn't too hard on him he might win another one - Barry Connell, trainer."
