🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over 1m3f at Southwell last month; met trouble when fav there since; down in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo; opened his account, despite rider dropping whip over 1f out, in 1m3f Southwell handicap last month; met trouble at a crucial stage when sent off 13-8 favourite back there (1m3f again) 18 days ago; can be given another chance to show what he can do from this mark but the shorter trip this evening asks a different question.

💬 Comment: Back to form when justifying market support over C&D recently; should go well again
🔦 Spotlight: Beat only one home in six Flat starts in 2024 but strong in the market on second outing back with Ian Williams and returned to form with a bang when seeing off ten rivals over C&D under Luke Morris 11 days ago; rated a lot higher earlier in his career so no surprise to see him follow up now he's rediscovered some form.
