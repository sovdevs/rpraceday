🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2nd in the Irish Derby, 4th in the King George and 3rd in the St Leger; sets the standard
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in the Irish Derby, fourth in the King George and third in the St Leger once upped to 1m4f+ last term, before his tenth when facing a stiff task in the Arc at Longchamp; he's the one to beat if returning in top form, with his two best ratings having been recorded on good ground.
Horse quote: 2024-09-14 at Doncaster (14.5f): "Sunway ran an absolute stormer. As usual, he ran his heart out. He just found a couple of better ones today. He could run again, we gave him a break so I assume he'll keep on going but I'm not sure where he'll run - David Menuisier, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Progressed well last term, placed in two Group 3s (1m2f/1m4f) on good to firm before grabbing a bumper prize in the USA on final outing; firmly in the mix on that and he could improve again.
Horse quote: 2024-08-31 at Kentucky Downs (10.5f): "Bellum Justum absolutely flubbed the start. I was way too far back, but lucky Jamie [Spencer, on pacesetting Navy Seal] was so fast. On the back straight, I was able to make good improvement to get a slot, because I knew he would stay very well. I knew he'd gallop out to the line because he stays a mile and a half - Frankie Dettori, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Unraced on good to firm except for a winning debut; failed to achieve the same success last year that he had as a 2yo but still made all in a Group 3 at Newmarket (1m5f) in July and good third in a German Group 1 (1m4f) in November on his only subsequent start; major player if returning on song.
Horse quote: 2024-07-11 at Newmarket (July) (13f): "We were quietly confident as Ancient Wisdom was the class horse in the race and was racing on ground that we know he relishes. The plan from here is to head to the Voltigeur if the ground is right and plan our way to the St Leger. He is an autumn horse and we won't jeopardise that by running him on unsuitable ground - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won the Melrose Handicap at York (1m6f, good to firm) in August but needs markedly better
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten in midfield in last year's Derby; won the highly competitive Melrose Handicap at York (1m6f, good to firm) in August but failed to back up the form in a Listed race at Ascot (1m6f, soft) in October; should have more to offer this term but, on current form, this looks a tough reappearance.
Horse quote: 2024-08-24 at York (14f): "That was extremely pleasing. Tabletalk looked the winner the whole way round. He'd been shaping up nicely at home and he seems to be improving.  I was thrilled to see him handle the ground so well, as that was a slight question mark for me, and he stayed on strong over the trip.  He's a very exciting prospect. It's great for the whole team at home who've worked very hard. He ran in the Derby and that was a really tough experience so we gave him a bit of time, he's a big horse and I think he'll make up into a lovely four-year-old.  He has a very patient owner who let me train him where we wanted to go. He ran a very good race at Ascot last time and he's come to himself nicely - Tom Clover, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: 1m2f Group 3 winner on heavy ground on first start last term, but the Derby didn't go well next time and he was unraced later as 3yo; back with a smooth AW win at Dundalk in February, before a lesser show back on testing ground three weeks ago; fair bit to find even on his best form and something to prove on good or firmer.
Horse quote: 2024-04-07 at Leopardstown (10f): "Dallas Star will be entered in all the big races now I suppose and we'll see where we go.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1m4f Listed winner last August for Rae Guest but no impact in her only three Group races
🔦 Spotlight: Trained hitherto by Rae Guest; major career-best efforts in two 1m4f Listed races on good to firm last August, winning at Newmarket on first occasion, but she tried just one Group race in each of the last three campaigns and the best she managed was seventh; latest (October, when last seen) was admittedly over just 1m2f but she needs to show something new to win this.
Horse quote: 2024-08-03 at Newmarket (July) (12f): "We knew we had a bit in hand today and, if everything went right, we thought we had a great chance. Divina Grace is going to stay in training next year. Quite a few people, including the jockey, have said she will get further. She still seems like she is improving, so hopefully we'll keep her racing and we'll find the right race for her - Rae Guest, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Weak claims but only four races; it's interesting to see him resuming at this level
🔦 Spotlight: Won narrowly in the mud both starts as 2yo in 2023, here on first occasion; put in his place last term in Listed race at Epsom (1m2f, good) in April and Group 3 over C&D (heavy) in October, ✂️ gelded in between; weak claims but he's had only four races and it's interesting to see him resuming at this level.
Horse quote: 2023-10-25 at Newmarket (8f): "Feigning Madness never looked like winning as he was just green. He looked green at Newbury and fell in a bit. He did the same today. He is a nice horse to win under a penalty as that takes a bit of doing. He surprised us at Newbury and I didn't think he would know enough, that is why I started him over seven furlongs. He galloped right out to the line. Next year he will want all of a mile and a half. I think we will end up rolling the dice with a nice race in the spring and see how he goes - Ralph Beckett, trainer."
