💬 Comment: Three-time Grade 1 winner in 2022, jumped badly and pulled up when favourite for Topham
🔦 Spotlight: Three Grade 1 wins in 2022; has been campaigned at a high level in recent seasons without much reward; took a step back in the right direction when 13l third in the Grade 1 Ascot Chase in February; let down by his jumping when favourite for the Topham won by stablemate Gentleman De Mee; cheekpieces now added to tongue-tie.
Horse quote: 2023-02-05 at Leopardstown (17f): "Blue Lord had a very hard race at Christmas and Paul thought that might have had an effect but I think maybe it was just the change of ground - Willie Mullins, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Useful novice last season, ending the campaign with victory over Must Be Obeyed in this race; at least as good when third in the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham in November; disappointing in race won by The King Of Prs at Fairyhouse in January; 8ln higher than last year's winning mark.
Horse quote: 2024-05-01 at Punchestown (20.5f): "Lets Go Champ ran very well here last year and was a little bit unlucky. He probably struggled a bit on the ground at Limerick but he was very good today. He could be a Galway Plate horse - Henry de Bromhead, trainer"

Horse quote: 2022-12-31 at Punchestown (23f): "Must Be Obeyed was good and tough. I didn't know if she was up to winning that. I knew she would love the ground, staying chasing is what we talked about and the test of stamina really tested her - Tom Gibney, trainer."

💬 Comment: Down the field in the Topham, better judged on Cheltenham Plate fourth, hard to win with
🔦 Spotlight: Has won only two of his 27 chase starts and his last success was in September 2023; however, he has run with credit in some major handicaps this season, including fourth in the Plate at Cheltenham, in front of stablemate Riann; below that form in the Topham.
Horse quote: 2023-08-03 at Galway (22.5f): "This was probably the race I should have gone for in the first place but Mars Harper came out of Tuesday's race well - Gordon Elliott, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: No success since a 2022 hat-trick, two Flat runs since down the field in the Grand Annual; some fair form but inconsistent in handicap hurdles last year; would be of interest if attracting market support.
Horse quote: 2022-10-20 at Carlisle (20f): "I missed the second-last and wasn't sure I was going to get the second horse. Going off ratings, So Scottish will nearly have to be dropped. I was lucky to get there. Early in the race he was travelling very well, he missed the second last but apart from that he was fairly good - Richie McLernon, rider."

Horse quote: 2025-01-11 at Fairyhouse (17f): "It's brilliant to win it, and brilliant to have the second and third as well. The King Of Prs was a very cheap purchase as a store, and he has kept improving. He has plenty of size and scope and there is no reason that he won't keep improving. Keith was a little bit annoyed with himself that he came wide on him in Leopardstown at Christmas, and he wasn't beaten far. He came out of it well, he's tough and hardy.

🔦 Spotlight: In the best form of his life when winning at Cheltenham and this festival in 2023; now at the veteran stage, fair third at Cheltenham in January; finished tenth in the Plate this time, appears held by Mars Harper and Riann.
Horse quote: 2023-04-29 at Punchestown (19f): "Seddon just loves galloping. People give out about horse racing, saying that it's cruel and all of this rubbish. He should be the poster boy for racing because he just loves doing it, and on top of that, he is very good - John McConnell, trainer."

💬 Comment: Won a three-runner Grade 2 race last October, in rear in a valuable DRF handicap on latest
🔦 Spotlight: Came on from his reappearance with a Grade 2 win in a three-runner contest at Gowran in October; well held in stronger Graded contests; ignored in the market (33-1) when in rear in a valuable DRF handicap on latest.
Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Gowran Park (20f): "Things certainly hadn't gone to plan since we got Visionarian as he wasn't right. That said, I was confident enough he'd run well but didn't expect him to win. I know the race ended up with only three runners, but we'll take it and he is now a Grade 2 winner. The Galway Plate was initially the plan, but he just wasn't right at that time and then was well beaten the last day, but he is back on track now - Gavin Cromwell, trainer."

💬 Comment: A recent hurdles win shows he is in good heart, no chase win since March 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Alternating between hurdles and fences of late, ran his best race for some time when third in a valuable 2m1f handicap chase off 126 at the DRF; unplaced at Gowran but a recent hurdles win shows he is in good heart; no chase win since March 2023.
Horse quote: 2021-12-26 at Leopardstown (17f): "Grange Walk is a fair horse who is only coming to himself. He'll probably go on for the Dan Moore at Fairyhouse from here. I was very happy coming here - I couldn't believe that Danny Mullins went to Kempton [to ride Tornado Flyer in the King George]. This horse is only a six-year-old so time is on his side - John Ryan, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Unplaced in this race last year, not a great deal of encouragement from this season's form; stable has stronger candidates.
Horse quote: 2024-03-17 at Down Royal (26f): "It was a good performance. I think Adamantly Chosen enjoyed himself, going a gear slower than he had been in those good handicaps, and he was able to get into a nice rhythm. I rode him a bit for speed, but he showed he stays today too. His best form is on better ground and he was a little bit off it when we got to a soft spot on the far side, but I was able to give him a chance and he came alive when we got to the third-last and the nicer ground. Into the spring and on nicer ground, he could be better again - Sean O'Keefe, jockey."
