🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Penultimate Wexford second puts her right in the mix in a weak maiden
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner is yet to score over hurdles but some good runs in defeat and went closest when runner-up at Wexford over 2m last month; in touch when faller three out on handicap debut at Bellewstown latest; handles good ground and 🎖️ major contender back in maiden company in a weak race.

🔦 Spotlight: Placed in a point-to-point and again on both maiden hurdle runs last month; excellent Leopardstown debut second (fourth won since) and not quite at same level at Thurles although would have held second but for ploughing through the last; definite contender.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 37,000Euros Harzand 5yo; worth a look if getting a run; reserve
🔦 Spotlight: First reserve; Harzand 5yo cost 37,000Euros as a foal; half-brother to winners The Short Go (useful 2m4f hurdle/3m chase) and The Mick Preston (bumper/2m hurdle); unraced dam closely related to useful 2m4f-2m7f hurdle/chase winner Ipsos Du Berlais; one to consider if getting a run.
