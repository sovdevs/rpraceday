🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Tongue-tie went on when he won his last two starts; pretty smooth last time after wind op
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Ascot (2m5f, good) last March and has now surged back better than ever when the tongue-tie went on for last two starts, winning at Huntingdon (extended 2m7f, good to soft) and Warwick (2m4f, soft); given wind surgery before latest and that win was pretty smooth, so he looks a leading contender despite 5lb rise.

💬 Comment: Pulled up three times this term yet also a career best; 🔥 big player if he's on his game
🔦 Spotlight: A right mixed bag this season, including having pulled up three times yet registered a career best with his Rowland Meyrick win at Wetherby (3m, good to soft) on Boxing Day; jumping mistakes have featured but 🔥 big player if he's on his game and this looks a much less competitive race than he's used to.

💬 Comment: First headgear and second chase when he won a five-runner C&D handicap (soft) last time
🔦 Spotlight: Fortunes have turned with the switch to chasing on last two starts, with first-time headgear as well when he won a five-runner novice handicap over C&D (soft) three weeks ago in clearcut fashion; all 17 races have been on softer than good; back up 5lb but good chance again if the ground is okay.

🔦 Spotlight: Won at Musselburgh (2m4f, soft) on the first day of 2024, registering a career best; absent 334 days afterwards and he's weakened out of it on all four starts this season but latest was a step back in the right direction and he's ⬇️ dropped in class; tried cheekpieces penultimate start (they now return) and he's unproven beyond 2m4f (tried 3m2f last time).
