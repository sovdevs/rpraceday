🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bought for 20,000gns as a 3yo but he has a high-class Flat pedigree
🔦 Spotlight: Excellent Flat pedigree as he's by Frankel and out of an unraced sister to a Group 1 winner; bred by Godolphin but unraced for that operation and was bought for 20,000gns as a 3yo; stable has a modest strike-rate in bumpers but this 4yo has to be of interest.
