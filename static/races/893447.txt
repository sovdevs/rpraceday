🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't count at Cheltenham but previous points' form gives him leading claims
🔦 Spotlight: Quite smart form when making all for open wins in February at Dungarvan and Tallow; unseated at the last, having trailed throughout, in Cheltenham Foxhunters last month; sights lowered considerably here and likely 🔥 big player.
