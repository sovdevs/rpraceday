🔦 Spotlight: Maybe needed his first run in the best part of a year behind Grey Fox over C&D last month, but the market spoke firmly his way there and that has to go down as disappointing; it leaves him with something to prove.

Horse quote: 2024-12-18 at Newbury (16.5f): "It was pretty good performance from the second-last. It's a good start. As soon as Believeitanducan jumped the first I thought he'd be all right and it's good to have a winner for the Owners Group again - Alan King, trainer."

💬 Comment: Two wins and a second from three runs over C&D; this mark is within range for in-form yard
🔦 Spotlight: Wildly inconsistent but made it two wins and a second from three starts over C&D when going in off 3lb lower a fortnight ago; this mark is within range for a yard going great guns if he's in the same mood.
Horse quote: 2023-05-16 at Sandown (14f): "Cinnodin didn't do much wrong at Wetherby, he was just a bit unfortunate in the circumstances. We thought this race might cut up and we had it as a plan a month ago. I don't normally like going a mile and three quarters with a three-year-old this early on but he would get two miles tomorrow as he is an out-and-out stayer - Richard Hughes, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Not allowed his own way over C&D last time, back from wind surgery, and that effort was likely similar to his previous near-miss here; is one to consider for a yard among the winners with its jumpers of late.

Horse quote: 2025-03-31 at Wolverhampton (AW) (14f): "You never want to be giving too much ground away [at the start] but even so, Alex The Great is a horse who wants to be coming off a pace.
