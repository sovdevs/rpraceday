🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Winning Irish pointer; slow start in Britain but stout 2nd back hurdling over 2m7f latest
🔦 Spotlight: Winning Irish pointer in 2022; missed 2023 and he wasn't in much form between February and May last year, nor when switched to fences in the autumn, but he put up a fighting display when runner-up to a well-treated one at Chepstow (2m7f, soft) recently; back up 3lb but good claims.

💬 Comment: Uphill over hurdles so far, including on handicap debut last May; out of weights again
🔦 Spotlight: Far from disgraced in sole bumper but it's been uphill over hurdles and was well held on her handicap debut at Ludlow last May; out of the weights again; now tongue tied with a visor replacing cheekpieces.

📝 Comment: novicey jumping, always 🔄 towards rear, ridden after 6th, soon tailed off (an inquiry was held into running and riding; jockey was interviewed and shown recordings of race and vet reported that a post-race examination of filly failed to reveal any abnormalities; jockey stated that instructions were to sit behind leaders and obtain cover as filly had raced keenly on previous run; he was then to ride his own race once filly had settled; he added that mare propped going into several hurdles jumping slowly and losing ground as a result throughout; he further added that in his opinion despite being tailed off, filly was not over tired and had popped the last hurdle nicely and had completed the race without showing any signs of fatigue; his explanation was noted)
