🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Plenty of debut promise last autumn for previous yard; 🔥 big player if handling surface
🔦 Spotlight: Wootton Bassett colt ran second in a barrier trial here last year and outran big odds for M Halford/T Collins team in late-season Leopardstown maiden, staying on from well back to get up for third over 1m; likely 🔥 big player if handling the surface.
