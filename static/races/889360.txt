🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In top form at favourite course Doncaster; leading candidate if he's as good here
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Doncaster (2m, good) last month and close second of three there since (2m, good); won over an extended 2m3f over hurdles; he's a Doncaster specialist but has shown promise elsewhere and is a leading candidate if his good form continues on his first visit here.

💬 Comment: Two wins at end of last year & today's return to better ground could be just what he needs
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row at the end of last year (3m/2m4f, good/good to soft); soft ground perhaps hasn't been ideal the last twice but he was a fair third at Wetherby most recently and the return to a better surface today could be just what he needs.

🔦 Spotlight: Made mistakes during short previous stint over fences in summer 2022, and pulled up on last run in this sphere; however, he won over C&D (good) that June and has shown some good form over hurdles this season (not seen to best effect over 3m on heavy latest); not ruled out now back chasing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unseated early on first two chase starts and is a risky proposition at present
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 5yo who made the frame in points; ran out over hurdles in January; he's unseated early on his first two chase starts (latest at Market Rasen yesterday) and is a risky proposition at present.
