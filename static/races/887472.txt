🔦 Spotlight: Reliable performer on AW and he went close to defying the widest stall in this race 12 months ago, finding only Kingdom Come too strong; closely matched with his old adversary here and warmed up for this with a good second at Dundalk two weeks ago; should run well but the draw is enough of a hindrance to look elsewhere.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won five times last year; may not have finished improving; good record fresh; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins in his fine 2024 campaign, recording a personal best with a snug win at Chester last August (7f, good); below par at Ascot five months ago but that was on soft, a surface he is yet to convince on; has a good record fresh and he could still have more to offer; big run expected.
