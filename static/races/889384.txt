🔦 Spotlight: Unseated/fell on her two outings at the end of last year and pulled up at Cheltenham recently; however, she was kicked before the start last time and was running pretty well when falling two out at Wetherby in December; won last season's Cheltenham Festival hunter chase and is 2-2 here; capable.

💬 Comment: Pulled up when bidding for Wincanton hat-trick; could be in the shake-up if bouncing back
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Wincanton (2m4f, good to soft) in December and followed up there in January (3m1f, heavy); pulled up there (3m1f, soft) last month and it's hard to be confident on the back of that, but a six-week break may have helped and he can be in the shake-up if rediscovering his 📈 progressive ways.
