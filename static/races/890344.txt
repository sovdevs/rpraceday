🔦 Spotlight: This Camelot colt trailed home on his Goodwood debut in September but proved a different proposition in blinkers when second at Salisbury (1m, heavy) a month later; subsequently ✂️ gelded; blinkers are left on reappearance and replaced by a first-time tongue-tie.

🔦 Spotlight: On the back of a promising York debut (1m, soft) last autumn he was sent off at 30-100 for a 9.5f Wolverhampton restricted maiden but got worried out of it near the finish, albeit well clear of the rest; remains open to improvement back on turf with blinkers added but others in this line-up have greater potential.
