🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stayed on well for close fourth over 2m5f at Kelso on handicap debut; this trip could suit
🔦 Spotlight: Won Cheltenham maiden (2m, good) in November on third hurdle start and followed up in Kelso novice (extended 2m6f, good to soft); another good run when staying on for close fourth on handicap debut at Kelso (2m5f, good to soft) last month and this new trip could prompt further improvement.
Horse quote: 2024-11-17 at Cheltenham (16.5f): "The key move was not committing from three out. It's disappointing for everyone that it's a four-runner race but Ace Of Spades will be progressive. Last season he just improved and hopefully he can this season - Dan Skelton, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Haydock latest; now 4lb higher in tougher race but this C&D winner is not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: After a wind op he reverted to hurdles at Haydock (3m, good) last month and returned to form to win that five-runner handicap; 4lb higher in a tougher race today but this C&D winner (good to soft) is not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2023-04-21 at Ayr (24.5f): "We have some good jumps horses and Imperial Merlin is one of them. We were hoping to go to Aintree with him but he fell last time so we decided to give him a bit of extra time off to come here. He might go straight over fences now but he's got a lot of scope off his mark, probably even when he's put up - Paul Costello, Imperial Racing."

Horse quote: 2025-01-18 at Haydock (21f): "I'm not sure about the decision, there's been softer bumps that have been awarded a race. It definitely put me off my stride, but they told me the winning distance was too far - Ryan Mania, jockey of I Am Max."

💬 Comment: Disputing lead when making mistake at final flight at Newbury; could have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Improvement is required but this lightly raced 6yo is in top hands and was disputing the lead when making a mistake at the final flight at Newbury (3m, good to soft) three weeks ago; could have more to offer; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2023-11-07 at Warwick (19f): "Nico (de Boinville) has just said Kintail is a work in progress and we are getting there with him. He is a lovely big baby. Like all those Blue Bresil's he has a laid back attitude to life. He would have learned a lot from. He is still looking around at everything that was going on, bar what was important. He will want to go do that again. All the two mile three-furlong race does is jump one hurdle in the back straight and then you are on the two-mile start. That was barely a two-mile race to me? They were going slowly over the first and to me it was like a two-mile race, but they didn't go a two-mile pace. I think the ground is quite hard work.?I wouldn't take away anything from Kintail. He just needs to learn a bit. The form of his bumper has worked out well and I think quite a lot of him as well - Nicky Henderson, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In and out this season but there have been some positive runs and he's not discounted
🔦 Spotlight: Has an in-and-out profile and was well beaten at Chepstow when last seen in February; however, he won at Uttoxeter (2m7f, soft) last November, and was second at Catterick (3m1f, soft) in January, and he should be fine on today's better ground if he's in the right mood; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2022-02-26 at Fairyhouse (16.5f): "Icare Allen jumped better today and was just a lot better than he was last time. He will go to Cheltenham but we have yet to make up our minds as to which race - Willie Mullins, trainer."

Horse quote: 2025-01-17 at Market Rasen (23f): "Belvedere Blast likes it here, but the trip was a bit of an unknown. We've tried everything with him - headgear, trips and ground - but the slower pace helped him and he started to like it late on. This is his level - Adrian Keatley, trainer."
