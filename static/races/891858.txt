💬 Comment: Solid fourth at Thirsk 19 days ago; she can make her presence felt off an easing mark
🔦 Spotlight: Low-mileage 4yo posted a solid fourth on her first turf run in 6f Thirsk handicap 19 days ago; she can make her presence felt off an easing mark.
Horse quote: 2023-12-28 at Newcastle (AW) (6f): "She's always been held in high regard, but her mind sometimes wants to do other things. Filly One isn't the easiest, so it was nice for her to back it up - Harry Russell, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Shaped as if run was needed when 15th at Doncaster on return; possibilities
🔦 Spotlight: On a losing run but he shaped as if the run was needed for his new handler when 15th in 5f Doncaster handicap 32 days ago, prominent to 1f out; possibilities with blinkers replacing cheekpieces.
Horse quote: 2022-09-16 at Ayr (6f): "Mattice is only a three-year-old and there could be some good days for him in the future - Tim Easterby, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: C&D scorer who didn't enjoy the smoothest of passages when 12th in 7f Chelmsford handicap 13 days ago; he can't be ruled out.
Horse quote: 2021-05-04 at Gowran Park (7f): "It was a good performance and Bellagio Man had to be brave. He had a terrible draw but it helped that the favourite got stuck in the stalls. Fair play to Colin and the horse as they took advantage of that. He's still a green horse and will improve from it. He was in front a long way from home and it was a fair performance. He wouldn't ideally like that ground, it went a bit slow, and we were a bit nervous before the race with the heavy showers yesterday and today. He's a good ground horse but because it was the first race we said we'd take our chance and we got away with it - Shane Lyons, assistant trainer."
