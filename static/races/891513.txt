🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Flew home to win comfortably at Lingfield (6f, AW) latest; 5lb rise fair; surface query
🔦 Spotlight: Raced exclusively on AW since his racecourse debut; sprung a 40-1 surprise at Lingfield (6f) 25 days ago, finishing with a real flourish down the outside to win comfortably; 5lb rise fair enough and this should be run to suit; chance if he can deliver such a potent finish on grass.

🎲 Repeat performance: Won before: ❌ No, Placed 2nd or 3rd before: ❌ No
🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Deteriorating ground/change of tactics offer excuses for latest run; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Hadn't been enjoying the rub of the green on AW and a change of tactics was employed at Newmarket 11 days ago (hood left off); unable to sustain the strong pace on that occasion but this is weaker and he has the assistance of Oisin Murphy in the saddle for the first time; faster ground in his favour too so there are grounds for optimism.
Horse quote: 2023-06-17 at York (6f): "The Haydock race Twilight Romance ran in worked out well. He looked a little bit green there and still looked as though he would improve further today. We'll probably work back from the 300,000GBP sales race here in August - Sean Quinn, assistant trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Likely he'll be sharper with his recent return to action at Thirsk behind him; only 1lb higher than for a Nottingham win (6f, soft) last October and no problem with faster ground; ran well in a maiden on only previous visit to Leicester.

🔦 Spotlight: The addition of a visor saw him win at Southwell (6f) in February, his first win since his 2yo debut; only fourth off this mark at Wolverhampton next time and an easy lead would seem unlikely.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Quiet on AW in late 2024 but returns to turf off a reduced mark; capable on a good day
🔦 Spotlight: Not at his best on AW on last four starts but a consequence of that is that he returns to turf off a 4lb lower mark than when winning at Brighton in September; capable on a good day.
Horse quote: 2024-05-28 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "The last three times Mart has been here, he's had such a bad draw, so today I said to Dylan [Cunha, trainer]: "I'm drawn out in the car park again, I'm just going to have to make the most of him" and I did well enough to get where I wanted. I thought I was beaten turning in but then he hit his last gear and motored home to win quite nicely - Rhys Clutterbuck, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner; 7lb lower than for her Newmarket win in November 2023; retains ability; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Retains ability after a spell on the sidelines and she's now 7lb lower than when beating a big field at Newmarket in November 2023; the ground was heavy there but it was good to firm when she won over C&D in July 2023; absent for 12 weeks but still quite interesting.
Horse quote: 2023-11-04 at Newmarket (6f): "Momaer ran well at Windsor last time out on soft ground and she seems to love the ground like this. Josie (Gordon) knew what she was doing so I just left it to her. The mare had her ground and she just kept filling her up. When they went past the two pole I was quite happy with how she was going. This mare has held her form well all year - Mark Loughnane, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Reappearance effort easy to forgive but, even so, he'll need a big step forward
