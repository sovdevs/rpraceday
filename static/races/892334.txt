🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Scored over C&D last month and is now 2-4 since cheekpieces were refitted
🔦 Spotlight: In-form 7yo who scored over C&D (good) last month and is now 2-4 since cheekpieces were refitted in December; latest 3lb rise does not look excessive and he's likely to be right in the thick of things again.
Horse quote: 2025-03-19 at Huntingdon (19.5f): "Cuban Court is a consistent sort who stepped up well from two miles and there's no reason why he can't go further. He's a versatile sort - Jack Quinlan, jockey."

💬 Comment: Pulled up on chase debut in February but otherwise in good form since winning in November
🔦 Spotlight: Came good over hurdles on stable debut at Hereford (2m5f, good) in November and, barring a disappointing chase debut in February, has remained in good form since; very respectable third in first-time cheekpieces here (2m4f, good) last month; probably won't be far away.
