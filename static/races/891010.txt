🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Always been useful and won easily at Gowran on second chase start; jumped well
🔦 Spotlight: Smart novice hurdler two seasons ago and ended up in a Grade 1 (well beaten); this winning pointer was always going to be a better chaser and, having probably needed his first run back after a long absence, he made no mistake at Gowran (2m4f, soft; jumped well); there should be plenty more to come over this longer trip.

💬 Comment: Classy mare who looked good on her chasing debut and there were excuses last time
🔦 Spotlight: Won a Grade 2 bumper and Grade 3 novice hurdle; looked good on her chase debut at Naas (2m4f, soft) and when below that level at Exeter (2m1f, good to soft) she made mistakes and lost a shoe; unraced over this far but there's plenty of stamina in the pedigree; every chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Probably career-best form in winning a 2m5f Listed handicap at Leopardstown
🔦 Spotlight: Quirky but very talented; peak RPR of 147 over hurdles when beating Spillane's Tower in a novice; beaten in eight of his ten chases but probably career-best form in winning a 2m5f Listed handicap at Leopardstown three weeks ago (yielding); has to be taken very seriously on the back of that, for all that his stamina for this far isn't entirely proven.

🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who bumped into smart opposition in his first two chases before beating the useful High Class Hero at Punchestown (3m, yielding); his pull-up in the Thyestes can be forgiven but Navan was disappointing, even allowing for the drop back to 2m4f; now on a recovery mission.

💬 Comment: Useful mare but would appear to have her work cut out at these weights
🔦 Spotlight: Useful mare who was second in a Grade 2 chase on her penultimate start but then finished seventh behind Monbeg Park in a handicap at Leopardstown (pestered for the lead); expected to come up shy again in today's company.
