🔦 Spotlight: Made all when a 7f novice winner at Kempton (Polytrack) in August 2023; ✂️ gelded after one more start; put up an eyecatching reappearance from a 577-day absence when running into third place at Lingfield (1m, Polytrack) last month; player if able to reproduce or better that.

🔦 Spotlight: C&D winner last spring, when 16lb higher; best effort this year was back over C&D in March, when third, so if he is to arrest the slump it could more likely be at this venue that others.
Horse quote: 2022-09-15 at Ayr (7f): "I think the world of Chuzzlewit. He relaxed lovely today but he was still green and backward and there is more to come. He shows speed at home but he'll have no problem staying a mile next year. He won't run again until next year, he'll keep progressing and I don't know how good he could be - Kevin Ryan, trainer."
