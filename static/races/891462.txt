🔦 Spotlight: His closing novice second on the AW (9.5f) didn't amount to much, with his market rival bombing and the winner well held since; yard has been among the winners with its jumpers of late but he'll need to improve back from six months off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needs to settle better, going without the hood this time and upped in trip; bit to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Pulled hard in the usual hood on her debut for new connections a fortnight ago, having joined from Charlie Johnston for 20,000gns, and that would be a concern today going without that headgear and upped from 7f; has a bit to prove now in a first-time tongue-tie.
