🎲 Repeat performance: Won before: ❌ No, Placed 2nd or 3rd before: ❌ No
🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a reduced mark and he was a fair fourth on AW last time; could be in the mix
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten 11 times since his last win in August 2023 but he's dropped down the weights and was a fair fourth at Wolverhampton (8.6f, AW) three weeks ago on his first run since wind surgery; could be in the mix.
Horse quote: 2023-08-19 at Doncaster (8f): "Harlem Nights is going the right way. The only time he hasn't been in the frame this year was when the ground was very fast at York and he didn't enjoy it. He's thriving on his racing and he's a lovely, straightforward horse. I put him in at Newmarket on Friday this morning and we'll see how he is and what the handicapper does - James Horton, trainer."

💬 Comment: Mixed form on final few outings last season but he won off 5lb higher last May
🔦 Spotlight: Mixed form on his final few runs last season and this 9yo makes his reappearance today; however, he's a C&D winner who is 5lb lower than when scoring at Redcar last May, and is not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2021-06-04 at Doncaster (8f): "Copper and Five has been running quite keen in behind so we decided to just let him stride over a bit shorter and it suited him down to the ground, he's battled right to the line. My saddle slipped on the way to the start and we just re-saddled him at the start - Joanna Mason, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: His mark continues to fall but this 10yo struggled to get competitive in the first half of last year and was well beaten at Doncaster last month when back from an absence.
Horse quote: 2018-04-19 at Ripon (8f): "That was a good run in Ireland last time. Crownthorpe is a work in progress, but has got potential and is going the right way - Robin O'Ryan, assistant trainer."
