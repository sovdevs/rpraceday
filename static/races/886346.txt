🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: After a second here he won comfortably at Wolverhampton; back up 6lb
🔦 Spotlight: His second win at Wolverhampton (7f) since returning from a break when comfortably justifying favouritism 25 days ago; 6lb rise to contend with but ran well here in December and looks a danger to all.

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo now on his fourth trainer; made a winning debut for this one when emerging from off the pace to win with a bit in hand at Newcastle (7f; AW debut); looks well handicapped off just 3lb higher.

🔦 Spotlight: Hard to judge as he's had four starts for this yard after an absence and has been pretty much tailed off in three of those; however, he was under 2l away when third over 1m here in November so can't be entirely dismissed.

🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't threatened to add to last summer's Windsor win but not a lot went right on his recent visits to Wolverhampton, with slow starts not helping; that trait remains a concern and he's drawn wide enough.

🔦 Spotlight: Hard to judge as he's had four starts for this yard after an absence and has been pretty much tailed off in three of those; however, he was under 2l away when third over 1m here in November so can't be entirely dismissed.
