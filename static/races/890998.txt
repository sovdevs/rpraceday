🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Beaten favourite last Sunday, needs to reverse form with Catherine Chroi and Loingseoir
🔦 Spotlight: Tough sort who held his form well during a busy campaign last season; has won only twice (from 41 starts) but placed 12 times, beaten favourite last Sunday; needs to reverse form with Catherine Chroi and Loingseoir but that is not out of the question.
