🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Infrequent turf winner but ran well when last seen and has a good record for B Loughnane
🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from 26 attempts on turf as opposed to 3-24 on AW; solid effort at Kempton last month and he does seem to go particularly well for Billy Loughnane; should go well from the front.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Needs everything to fall right but on a lowly mark on turf and this trip could be ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Slow starts often leave him a hostage to fortune and he hasn't won as often as he probably ought to have; that said, he has a lowly turf rating to exploit and this extended 5f should suit.

💬 Comment: Promise on return and poorly drawn latest; on a winning mark; another to consider
🔦 Spotlight: Shaped quite well at Doncaster on her seasonal return; backward step at Musselburgh last time but she wasn't well drawn; has quickly become well treated and she's another to consider in a wide-open handicap.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ended losing run last May before adding 3 more wins; encouraging return; each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: His handicap mark had dropped from 106 to 50 before he was finally able to add to his debut win (June 2020; beaten 40 times in between) at Nottingham last May; went on to complete a four-timer, including C&D, and also went close at Pontefract off this mark last October; should be sharper with his recent reappearance behind him; not discounted.
Horse quote: 2020-07-09 at Newmarket (July) (6f): "Yazaman ran differently to Ascot in that he jumped and travelled really well over the extra furlong, while he was a bit outpaced at Ascot. I think the winner is pretty good and we were beaten by a better horse. To give our horse some credit I don't think he saw the winner coming as he was a long way from him. He's grown up a lot since his debut and he's a grand horse, but he's an out and out two-year-old so we need to get on with him and make use of him. He didn't mind the ground today - Maureen Haggas, wife of William Haggas, trainer."

Horse quote: 2020-06-12 at Wolverhampton (AW) (5f): "Jojo Rabbit got a nice lead this time rather than at Lingfield where he made the running and got hassled out of it. He's a nice type - Hollie Doyle, jockey."

💬 Comment: Won twice last year and his reappearance can be upgraded on two counts; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Won two sprint handicaps last season (5f, good to firm and 6f, AW); pleasing return to action at Pontefract (5f, good) in a race where he was poorly positioned (held up in a race where nothing got into it and also made his challenge up the middle of the track); he'll need luck in running from stall 1 but he's capable of winning a similar event.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ties in with Glory Hyde on 2024 form but likely best watched back from 227 days off
🔦 Spotlight: Beat Glory Hyde by just under one length at Redcar last May (5f, good to firm) and he's 3lb better off with her today; well behind her at Thirsk on his next start though and he is returning from 227 days off.
