🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Stamina unproven but he's coming here in fine form with six wins already this year
🔦 Spotlight: Six wins and a third in seven runs in 2025, taking another step forward with an easy win at Southwell last week (1m3f); stamina for 2m has to be taken on trust but he was impressive on his only Newcastle run (1m4f) and may well defy his penalty.

🔦 Spotlight: Two improved efforts since upped to 2m and tackling handicaps, second at Southwell before a hard-fought success at Kempton seven weeks ago; 3lb rise shouldn't prevent another big run.
