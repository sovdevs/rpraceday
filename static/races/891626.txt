🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: May show progress now handicapping with Nottingham reappearance under his belt
🔦 Spotlight: Thrice-raced colt who represents shrewd connections and may be capable of progress now handicapping with Nottingham reappearance under his belt; won over 1m at Ayr on debut.
Horse quote: 2024-09-19 at Ayr (8f): "Hornsea Bay looked impressive. His home work had been pretty good. If you debut them over a mile at this time of year you like to think they'll stay ten furlongs and maybe a mile and a half. We might run him in another novice for experience. He could be nice next year, he's got a good pedigree as well - David O'Meara, trainer."

Horse quote: 2025-02-01 at Newcastle (AW) (8f): "The plan was always to make the running like we did at Kempton last time out and Molveno relaxed really well in front. His ears were pricked forward just looking at everything, but he won really nicely - Marco Ghiani, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
