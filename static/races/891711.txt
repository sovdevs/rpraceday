🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Justified favouritism with comfortable win over C&D latest; 🔥 big player again up 4lb
🔦 Spotlight: Four-time Flat winner who got off the mark over hurdles when justifying favouritism in C&D handicap (good to firm; Galactic Glow second) two weeks ago; that was a comfortable success under a prominent ride and a 4lb rise looks fair; key player.
Horse quote: 2024-06-07 at Bath (14f): "Joe (Tickle) said Taritino needs a bit of daylight and if he doesn't jump he can be tricky but he did jump. To be fair he was very free, I managed to get two breathers into him but when the other horse came alongside he lit me up again. It was a good effort considering. He'll probably get 2m - Hollie Doyle, jockey, speaking to Sky Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark on his sixth attempt over hurdles when making most in a Kempton handicap (2m, good) three weeks ago; there wasn't much separating the first three but he battled well to come out on top and is open to more progress; respected up 4lb.

🔦 Spotlight: Took advantage of a reduced mark when upped to 2m4f at Worcester (good) last July and he backed that up with a close third at Uttoxeter (2m4f, soft) 16 days later; drops back in trip after nine months off but he's only 1lb higher than last time and is respected on first run since rejoining Fergal O'Brien.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well behind stablemate Taritino over C&D latest but he's now 0-11 over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: All of his three Flat wins were in 2023 and he's 0-11 over hurdles; ran well when a 40-1 second over C&D (good to firm) last time but that was behind his stablemate Taritino and he's not certain to back that up; others are more solid.

💬 Comment: 0-12 over hurdles and was pulled up when last seen in September; down the list
🔦 Spotlight: Made the frame in three maidens (2m-2m4f) last summer but he's failed to complete in last two starts including when back in a handicap at Plumpton (pulled up) in September; hurdling record now stands at 0-12 and has something to prove on his return; change of headgear.

💬 Comment: 11-race maiden and he's finished in rear in last two runs; others preferred
🔦 Spotlight: Creditable third off 5lb higher at Market Rasen (2m, good) last June but he's not matched that form in three runs since and is now 0-11; others are more convincing.
