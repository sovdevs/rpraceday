🔦 Spotlight: Sister to top-class Cracksman (RPR 131); dam a Listed winner; ended up finishing fifth of the eight runners at Doncaster (1m, soft) on October's debut but there was a moment in the final furlong where second looked a possibility; open to plenty of improvement this year and the Gosden yard have enjoyed success in this race (four wins since 2017).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 85,000gns yearling; well-related filly but she makes her debut in a useful event
🔦 Spotlight: 70,000gns foal, 85,000gns yearling; eighth foal; closely related to winners Nancy From Nairobi (1m-1m2f including US Grade 2; RPR 105) and Air Force Amy (1m4f; 80), half-sister to 1m2f Listed winner Ad Infinitum (102); dam Listed-placed 6f AW winner (87); looks the part on paper but she'll need to be useful to make a winning start in this field.

🔦 Spotlight: 150-1 for her Yarmouth debut last October (1m, good to soft), a race in which she was never in the hunt; bred to do better in time but likely over even further.
