🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Last month's third over 3m at Clonmel suggests a breakthrough win is feasible
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; 0-18 under rules; ran twice over 3m at Clonmel last month; set a daunting task in a three-runner Grade 3 before a creditable third in a handicap in which Mullanour and Glorious Singer finished in mid-division; stable won this event with Thedancingfarrier last year.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Much-improved when second at Limerick, failed to reproduce form at Clonmel, held by Kalnoo
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner; major improvement from his first handicap when second over 2m5f at Limerick in January; that form has been well advertised over fences by the winner Maciver; sent off favourite at Clonmel three weeks ago, but got loose beforehand and failed to make his presence felt; need to reverse form with third-palced Klanno.

💬 Comment: Reported coughing after Fairyhouse run, no apparent excuse at Leopardstown, up against it
🔦 Spotlight: Weak overall form; pulled up early at Fairyhouse in her first handicap; reported coughing, and trainer suggested she might have resented a tongue-tie; however, she wore it again with a visor added when in rear at Leopardstown last time; up against it.
