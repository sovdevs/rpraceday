🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2023 Galway winner but largely out of sorts since; worth a 📊 market check on stable debut.
🔦 Spotlight: Galway winner in October 2023 whose losing run is mounting up; better effort when third at Tramore on New Year's Day; pulled up 15 days later but becomes of interest having now joined James Owen and is one to watch in the market.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In better form than most and a player here with the drop in trip a plus.
🔦 Spotlight: Has posted two encouraging efforts this year, latest when fading late on first go at 3m1f at Plumpton last month; has more things going for him than most and likely to be thereabouts with the drop back in distance a positive move.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggling over fences this term but reverts to hurdles on a good mark in new headgear.
🔦 Spotlight: Largely struggling for form this season over fences, apart from his second at Huntingdon (2m7f, soft) in December when tried in blinkers, and failed to complete when fitted with a visor on last two starts; reverts to hurdles on a good mark and hard to dismiss if the newly fitted cheekpieces have a positive effect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of sorts this season; coming down the weights but others appeal more.
🔦 Spotlight: A soft-ground hurdle winner off this mark at Taunton last February for previous stable but well held on all starts this season for current connections, latest when pulled up  back at Taunton last month; sliding down the weights but doesn't look like capitalising on that anytime soon.
