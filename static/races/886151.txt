🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed as a chaser and has claims if judged on his fifth here (2m5f) in December
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-pointer who was only beaten about 5l when fifth of 13 here (2m5f, good to soft) on chase/handicap debut in December; raced rather lazily and made jumping errors when below that form at Huntingdon last month but has possibilities if perked up by the refitted cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed as a chaser and has claims if judged on his fifth here (2m5f) in December
🔦 Spotlight: Ex-pointer who was only beaten about 5l when fifth of 13 here (2m5f, good to soft) on chase/handicap debut in December; raced rather lazily and made jumping errors when below that form at Huntingdon last month but has possibilities if perked up by the refitted cheekpieces.
