🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two C&D wins in 2024; took late 2nd here in January; not sustain effort at Southwell since
🔦 Spotlight: Two C&D wins in 2024; came from off the pace to take a late second here two starts ago, just ahead of Mighty Gurkha, but he didn't sustain his effort with cheekpieces added at Southwell since; return here is a plus.
