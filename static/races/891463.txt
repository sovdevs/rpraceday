🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked unfortunate not to go even closer when third on his seasonal/stable debut
🔦 Spotlight: Bit of a mixed bag in four starts for Kevin Philippart De Foy last year, but looked unfortunate not to go even closer when third of ten on his seasonal/stable debut at Nottingham (1m, good) 13 days ago; the longer trip shouldn't be a problem and he's one for the shortlist.

🔦 Spotlight: Triple-figure prices and well beaten in three starts over 7f on the AW last October; makes his handicap/turf debut after six months off, having been ✂️ gelded, and no surprise if he takes a big step forward being a half-brother to seven winners, including three with triple-figure RPRs; market useful.

🔦 Spotlight: Out of the frame in three starts over 7f but was beaten only just over a length into fifth of 11 on his return at Wolverhampton (7f, AW) last month from 175 days off; this longer trip should suit on breeding and he's worth a second look on handicap debut.
