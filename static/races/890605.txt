🔦 Spotlight: Placed three consecutive times since returning from a break in February, most recently when second of 14 at Taunton (2m, good) last month; today's longer trip will also suit; obvious contender.
Horse quote: 2022-05-23 at Ludlow (16f): "Zucayan travelled very strongly and jumped the best he's jumped apart from two out, when he nearly took it with us. We always thought he had a good engine but his jumping didn't help in those novice hurdles - Nick Slatter, jockey."
