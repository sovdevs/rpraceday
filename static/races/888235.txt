🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Opened his British account with a ready success over C&D last time; warrants respect
🔦 Spotlight: Rather frustrating for a while but registered an emphatic success in second-time blinkers over C&D (good to soft; fifth chase start) most recently, belatedly opening his British account; could show further progress in the retained blinds; respected.

🔦 Spotlight: Largely consistent record at Kempton features three wins, and the soft ground wasn't ideal in most recent course attempt; creditable second (off 10lb higher) behind Outlaw Peter in this race last year and is weighted to reverse the placings.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Useful for Willie Mullins; far from solid on his form for 🆕 new yard
🔦 Spotlight: Useful chaser for Willie Mullins and is on a workable mark judged on best form; however, looks far from solid on his efforts (hurdles/fences) for 🆕 new yard; others preferred.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unsuited by drop back to 2m4f last time; needs a return to further
🔦 Spotlight: Most of his chase form is at longer distances; seemed unsuited by the drop back to 2m4f last time and is best watched; gained most recent win over 3m3f last June.
