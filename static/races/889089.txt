🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed twice at this venue, not far off his best here three weeks ago, should go close
🔦 Spotlight: Good effort when keeping on well for third in a 6f maiden here in November; never got involved after a slow start in a 1m handicap here in January; probably not far off his best when third behind odds-on shot Cee En Gee in a conditions race over 7f three weeks ago; officially rated the equal of No Return.
