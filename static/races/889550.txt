🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced in last 12 months and has struggled in last three runs; lots to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Both AW wins have been at Newcastle for previous trainer; fair second of eight on stable debut here (9.4f) last February but he's had only three runs since and has struggled in all of them; lots to prove.
