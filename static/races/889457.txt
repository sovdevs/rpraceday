💬 Comment: Rallied to win the Arkle at Cheltenham and this step back up in trip is a likely positive
🔦 Spotlight: Short-headed in Grade 1 Scilly Isles at Sandown (2m4f, heavy) in February on second chase start and rallied from a very unpromising position to win the Arkle at Cheltenham (2m, good to soft) last month; unraced on good ground; ran big races over hurdles on both visits here and he's a leading contender with the step back up in trip likely to be in his favour.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Grade 1 Aintree Hurdle last year; major player if jumping better now in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 1 Aintree Hurdle (2m4f, soft) 12 months ago and made it 2-2 over fences in the Grade 1 Faugheen Novice Chase at Limerick (2m3f, yielding to soft) in December; has also won on good ground; didn't jump well when third at Leopardstown in February (Croke Park about 5l ahead in second) but he's a major player if the first-time cheekpieces help him find fluency.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won Grade 1 Aintree Hurdle last year; major player if jumping better now in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Won Grade 1 Aintree Hurdle (2m4f, soft) 12 months ago and made it 2-2 over fences in the Grade 1 Faugheen Novice Chase at Limerick (2m3f, yielding to soft) in December; has also won on good ground; didn't jump well when third at Leopardstown in February (Croke Park about 5l ahead in second) but he's a major player if the first-time cheekpieces help him find fluency.
