🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made good progress in 7f handicaps last year; may improve again this year; no headgear
🔦 Spotlight: AW win last March but his form took off on turf in the summer, adding 7f handicaps at Ayr (twice) and Doncaster to his tally in midsummer; ended 2024 with another career-best RPR when second at Ayr (7f, good to firm); likely to progress again this year but he goes without the cheekpieces he wore on his most recent start now back from seven months off.
Horse quote: 2024-07-08 at Ayr (7f): "They went very hard and I thought the pace was always going to collapse and it helped the closers like me. Al Muqdad has been very consistent and good, quicker ground is probably his thing. Seven furlongs is probably his best trip - Danny Tudhope, jockey, speaking on Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good run after a break here two weeks ago (1m); three C&D wins on his record; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: Three of his eight wins have come over C&D; has no great record fresh so it was encouraging that he could run so well over 1m here two weeks ago, his first outing since November; major player back down in trip.
Horse quote: 2023-06-24 at Redcar (7f): "Cruyff Turn was eliminated from the Buckingham Palace Handicap at Royal Ascot so we came here as he likes the track and good ground. I hope this will give him a bit of confidence and we could aim him at the mile handicap at the Ebor meeting he won two years ago - William Easterby, assistant trainer."

Horse quote: 2023-09-15 at Doncaster (7f): "Circe ran in a quality race at Sandown, she was beaten by two horses with experience. I thought she'd step forward and she has. She's a big horse with plenty of scope and she'll make a nice three-year-old - Sean Levey, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well backed on recent stable debut but struggled in a race not run to suit; can do better
🔦 Spotlight: 7f winner for Dermot Weld; attracted support on recent stable debut (1m, good) but never featured in a race in which those held up were disadvantaged; ⬆️ up in class today; interesting to see if his backers return.
Horse quote: 2023-08-01 at Galway (7f): "LIVIO MILO deserved it, he's very consistent and was second on his last three runs. He probably is better over a mile and that's why the plan was to push on and get first run. He battled hard and got a good ride. He is very versatile and that's his level - Dermot Weld, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up off similar marks twice this winter when trained by Ed Bethell; weakened in the closing stages on last month's stable debut and he'll need a clear personal best back on turf.

🔦 Spotlight: Well handicapped on 2023 form but he had a quiet year in 2024 and neither run for his new stable has suggested he's ready to strike; the return to 7f and a wind op since last seen will offer encouragement to his potential supporters.
Horse quote: 2023-06-17 at York (6f): "The Green Man did that easily enough and he's in good order with himself, he hasn't moved as well as this in a long time. He's flourishing. He's a big horse and he's just fully maturing - Joseph Parr, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Looked a good prospect as a 2yo, winning a 6f novice here (soft) either side of placed efforts at York and Newcastle; bitterly disappointing in two handicaps in the spring of 2023, after which he was ✂️ gelded; absent for 713 days but makes his stable debut (same owner) off a reduced mark; betting to guide now tackling 7f for the first time.
