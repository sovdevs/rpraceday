🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: After 315 days away, he ran a mighty race to finish a close third in the Champion Bumper
🔦 Spotlight: The ground was heavy when winning a Listed bumper at Limerick last season and, after 315 days away, he ran a mighty race to finish a close third in the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham; well positioned in that steadily-run race but there's no knocking the form.
Horse quote: 2024-03-24 at Limerick (16f): "Shuttle Diplomacy is a proper horse. Bryan (Cooper) rode him in work on Tuesday and he was awesome. He was able to quicken a third time, he's just very good. He was very green at Naas. He was bought very cheap and I've had him since he was a two-year-old. He'll go to Punchestown now. He's a fine horse and has so many gears - Thomas Cooper, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Impressed in a point; more workmanlike in his bumper but he's clearly promising
🔦 Spotlight: Bought for £330,000 after impressing in a 3m point at Portrush; only workmanlike in winning his bumper at Leopardstown over Christmas but the third is a half-brother to State Man who has since won a maiden hurdle; this 5yo should have lots more to offer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran well at Cheltenham but has 4l to find with third-placed Shuttle Diplomacy
🔦 Spotlight: Bang there in two bumpers at Leopardstown (the latest a Grade 2) and he ran well to be seventh of 17 in the Champion Bumper, where he appeared to get outpaced when it mattered; has 4l to find with third-placed Shuttle Diplomacy but these conditions can be a great leveller; respected.
Horse quote: 2024-11-26 at Tramore (16f): "Authorized is a brilliant sire and Jody did well to get Sortudo settled. I think there should be a lot of improvement in him. He's an exciting horse and will probably stay in bumpers this year. We'll see how he comes out of the race and look at Leopardstown over Christmas. He could be at the top end of our bumper horses - Patrick Mullins, assistant trainer."

💬 Comment: Dual bumper winner and withdrawn from a Grade 2 novice hurdle here earlier this month
🔦 Spotlight: Only seventh in a maiden hurdle to kick off with but has won both his bumpers, the first here and then making all at Naas (on heavy); withdrawn from a Grade 2 novice hurdle here earlier this month due to yielding ground; clearly held in some regard.
Horse quote: 2025-02-23 at Naas (15.5f): "Obviously I'll Sort That is not going to Cheltenham but could go to Fairyhouse for a winners of three and then out to grass. We'd be looking forward to him next year, he's a lovely horse to have - Declan Queally, jockey."
