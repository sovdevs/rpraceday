💬 Comment: Fine C&D comeback run in January; granted normal improvement, could take the beating here
🔦 Spotlight: Yet to win on this surface, the latest of two turf wins coming in 2022; very promising C&D comeback run in January when only losing second late on when unfancied (fourth and fifth have won since); granted normal improvement, could take the beating here.
