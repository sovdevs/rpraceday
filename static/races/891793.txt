🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner who was beaten a nose at Pontefract a week ago; races off the same mark
🔦 Spotlight: Dual C&D winner who failed by only a nose when back down to a Class 5 at Pontefract (5f, good) a week ago; races off the same mark and a solid chance of going one better; cheekpieces return.
Horse quote: 2023-05-12 at Ripon (5f): "He did it well. Reigning Profit broke very quickly so I travelled strongly through the race and I think he was just getting a little tired near the line - James Sullivan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

Horse quote: 2023-01-06 at Dundalk (AW) (6f): "Aces Wild is a fast little horse and he's lightly raced and those kind of sprinters improve with age. We are hopeful he will keep the ball rolling - John McConnell, trainer"

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has won his last five starts on the AW, the latest when dead-heating with Recon Mission
🔦 Spotlight: Comes into this in red-hot form having won his last five starts on the AW, the latest when dead-heating with Recon Mission at Lingfield (5f, Polytrack) 11 days ago; meets him on the same terms and has winning form over C&D, so hard to rule out despite a 7lb higher mark and rise in grade.
Horse quote: 2025-03-28 at Lingfield (AW) (5f): "Rossa [Ryan] has clicked with him and that was an unbelievable ride he gave Midnightattheoasis. I was worried about him going down the hill and that played out in the race, but luckily Rossa switched him inside round the bend and that galvanised him. The drop back to five has worked a treat. He travels very strongly and we ran him a lot over six furlongs but I'll hold my hands up and say that was trainer error. It was more by accident we popped him in at Wolverhampton two weeks ago but we've found the key to him now. He'll still only be off 61 [at Chelmsford next Thursday], and he was rated 70 at one point. We're lucky to have plenty of turnout and he won't have the tack on him until he goes to Chelmsford, which works well for these sprinters - Phil McEntee, trainer."

💬 Comment: Dead-heated with Midnightattheoasis at Lingfield 11 days ago; may enjoy run of the race
🔦 Spotlight: The only one of these without a win over C&D, but managed to end a long losing run when dead-heating with Midnightattheoasis at Lingfield (5f, Polytrack) 11 days ago (now 7lb higher but meets him on the same terms); may enjoy the run of the race in front.
Horse quote: 2022-07-21 at Sandown (5f): "I wasn't sure (if I'd held on) but the second horse just gave me a nudge towards the line and with these older sprinters, it has probably helped me more than anything as he'd just got a little bit lonely in front. He was hanging left towards the stands and I just needed a bit of company towards the line - Tom Marquand, jockey."
