🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Still early days for 🆕 new yard; won her last two (2m2f/2m3f) and strong claims if she stays
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Kelso (2m2f, good to soft) in December on second stable start and followed up at Catterick (2m3f, good to soft); effective on soft ground on the Flat; stamina is the big question today for this Flat-bred 6yo but she's finished well the last twice and will have strong claims if she stays.

🔦 Spotlight: Made very promising start to rules career in 2022-23 and ran fair race when sixth at Chepstow (2m7f, soft) 18 days ago on her first outing since November 2023; this 10yo is well treated on her old form and could build on that latest performance; yard won this last year and she's a possible.
