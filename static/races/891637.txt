🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Promising 2nd over C&D on last month's debut; open to improvement and holds strong claims
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to the stable's classy Group 3 winner Soprano; promising start to his career when chasing home a stablemate of Rising Power over C&D 17 days ago, a race where his main rival had the advantage of the rail and also looked more professional; open to improvement and bids to emulate the same owner's The Actor who won this race last year having finished second at the Craven meeting.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four runs already, making all to win at Yarmouth 12 days ago; vulnerable under a penalty
🔦 Spotlight: He is having his fifth start of the season already, improving at the fourth attempt when making all at Yarmouth 12 days ago (5f, good to firm); his experience, early pace and toughness will serve him well but it would be a surprise if he could concede weight to some interesting opposition.
