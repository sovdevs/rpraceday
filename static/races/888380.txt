💬 Comment: Offered little on his recent comeback here for new connections and goes right up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Flat and hurdle winner (both on soft ground) for Ben Haslam early last summer before losing his way; offered very little on his recent comeback here (1m) for new connections and goes right up in trip tonight.
