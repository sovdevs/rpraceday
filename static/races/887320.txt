🔦 Spotlight: All starts on good to soft; should still be unbeaten as she looked unlucky in Listed grade at Market Rasen most recently, nearly getting up having finished very strongly from a difficult position that was partly caused by meeting some trouble; 2-2 previously; remains of major interest.
