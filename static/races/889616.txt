💬 Comment: Easy 6f win at Kempton when last seen 6 months ago; tongue tied for her return/h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Below par on soft turf on her second start (blew the start) but that run was sandwiched by two good Kempton runs, notably an easy 6f win when last seen 192 days ago; 🔍 unexposed and one to note for market confidence with a tongue-tie fitted on her handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Easy 6f win at Kempton when last seen 6 months ago; tongue tied for her return/h'cap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Below par on soft turf on her second start (blew the start) but that run was sandwiched by two good Kempton runs, notably an easy 6f win when last seen 192 days ago; 🔍 unexposed and one to note for market confidence with a tongue-tie fitted on her handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two wins, one here, for C Johnston as a 2yo; sold 12,000gns last October; betting useful
🔦 Spotlight: Two front-running wins as a 2yo when trained by Charlie Johnston (including here over 5f); sold for 12,000gns after a couple of lesser effots last September; well drawn for a prominent racer and interesting to see how she goes in the betting on her first run for Kevin Ryan.
