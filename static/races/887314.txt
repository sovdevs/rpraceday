🔦 Spotlight: Wants better ground than when second at Sandown (2m, soft), so that was a fair run over a trip too short for all that the race fell apart at the seams; back off her correct mark here and returned to 3m, she's one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Fair effort over fences here last time (3m1f handicap, good to soft) with the cheekpieces back on and they're retained with an additional tongue-tie, a combination that worked well in points; now tackles his first handicap over hurdles; hard to dismiss.
