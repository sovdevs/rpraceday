🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two-time novice winner who brings potential to handicap debut, especially now up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Won a novice hurdle at Carlisle (2m1f, soft) in December and defied a penalty at Market Rasen (2m, good to soft) recently; could do with jumping better but he brings potential to this handicap debut, especially now up in trip; could have plenty more to offer.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair fourth at Ludlow last time and a stronger pace could help in this bigger field
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who produced his best run yet in a handicap when keeping on for 5l fourth of eight to Whatsupwithyou at Ludlow (2m5f, good to soft) last month; back up in grade today and improvement is needed, but a stronger pace could help in this big field; one to consider.

🔦 Spotlight: Won two 3m chases last year and he's well handicapped on that form; however, this 10yo was pulled up on his last hurdle start in October 2021 and there's also a question mark regarding the drop back in trip.
