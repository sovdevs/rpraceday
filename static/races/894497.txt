💬 Comment: Major each-way claims if the cheekpieces (tried once in 2023, well beaten) prove okay
🔦 Spotlight: He's never won a turf handicap (took two on AW, latest in April 2024) but usually ends up on the premises and is virtually on his lowest mark; Catterick fourth eight days ago restated that he has major each-way claims if the returning cheekpieces (tried once in 2023, well beaten) prove okay.

💬 Comment: 1-22 strike-rate; seven seconds, including in four of his five outings in cheekpieces
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win from 22 races was at Nottingham (6f) last August; seven seconds, including in four of his five outings in cheekpieces, might set some alarm bells ringing but he kept on well when beaten a neck at Nottingham (5f, good) on latest outing and he's well capable of being seriously involved.

💬 Comment: Beaten a head on reappearance; never showed eight days go but from a wide draw
🔦 Spotlight: Dual 0-50 classified winner last summer, over C&D on second occasion; runner-up in 5f handicaps twice last term and again on reappearance when beaten a head at Catterick, and although she never showed back at Catterick eight days ago, the wide draw provides an excuse; not dismissed.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Return to turf at Musselburgh (Class 4; 28-1) recently wasn't great but case can be made
🔦 Spotlight: Eight wins, most on AW but he scored three times over 5f on good or good to firm last summer; return to turf at Musselburgh (Class 4; 28-1) 18 days ago wasn't great but he's back to his last winning mark from turf.
Horse quote: 2024-06-24 at Thirsk (5f): "Golden Rainbow has been brilliant for us. We picked this race out when he won here before and both that and his last run at Musselburgh have worked out. He's the only horse to beat Phil McEntee's Jacquelina on turf this year, who's now rated in the 80s and well thought of. He loves the fast ground and I hope he can continue to progress to pick up a couple more prizes in the Yorkshire area - Rebecca Menzies, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won two in a row when front-running over 6f last July; layoff and 5f may both be problems
🔦 Spotlight: Won two in a row when front-running over 6f last July, including by 4l on good to firm at this track and she's now on the same mark; whether she can keep it up after her layoff (107 days) is a question, though, and she ran over 5f last season only once.
Horse quote: 2024-07-18 at Hamilton (6f): "That was a lot closer than I originally thought, but at least we can call Stormy Pearl a winner again, which is great. I couldn't see anything between them in the photo but if she had kept a little bit straighter she may have been a clear winner, but that's racing and it was great to see her run so well. She's a lovely filly who's usually consistent and seems to really like the place. We'll be back this season we hope, don't you worry about that! - David Thompson, trainer."
