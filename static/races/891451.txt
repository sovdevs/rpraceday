💬 Comment: In a consistent vein of form but brings a portion of frustration (no win since 2022)
🔦 Spotlight: Consistent on AW since December and ties in with some of these rivals; capable of being involved and has each-way possibilities but brings a portion of frustration, having failed to win since 2022.
Horse quote: 2022-04-30 at Newmarket (5f): "Existent is a nice straightforward horse to deal with and hopefully he will now go on to the King's Stand Stakes. Tom (Morley, owner) and his mum have won the race twice before and we entered him for it last week. It is a bit of an ask, being rated 101, but we think he definitely warranted an entry and I think it should suit him. I think five is his best trip for us - Stuart Williams, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-06-20 at Chelmsford (AW) (5f): "Almaty Star has been a bit of a revelation since dropping him back to five and using those forcing tactics.

💬 Comment: Has failed to build on February win and faces a stiffer assignment back on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Campaigned mostly on AW; took well to first-time blinkers in February but has failed to build on that success and this return to turf presents a stiffer assignment; headgear retained.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Both wins at York; never dangerous in last year's 3yo Dash in sole Epsom run
🔦 Spotlight: Has gained both wins at York and may be more interesting when returned to that venue; never dangerous in last year's 3yo Dash in sole Epsom attempt; ✂️ gelded over the winter.
Horse quote: 2023-09-10 at York (6f): "The Coffee Pod was third in the Hornblower last time to a couple of good horses, but we thought this would suit him. Richard says he wants 7f, maybe a mile eventually, so we might step him up next time. We've got the job done and hopefully go on from there - Tim Palin, racing director of Middleham Park Racing, owners."
