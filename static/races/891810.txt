🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Running well lately including second of 12 here (13.3f) last time; should go well again
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins on the AW including here (1m2f); twice placed off this mark since winning narrowly at Southwell (1m4f, Tapeta) in January, including when second of 12 back here (13.3f) last time; should go well again.
Horse quote: 2025-01-31 at Southwell (AW) (12f): "I'm absolutely thrilled, it's really nice to get the monkey off our backs. We've only been going from the 1st of January and we haven't had much to run. We weren't really expecting much tonight but what a legend Smokey Malone is, he always gets us out of trouble and he's Dylan's [Hogan, jockey] favourite horse as well - Shelley Birkett, joint-trainer, talking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Both wins have come at Newcastle (1m4f, Tapeta); running better of late having dropped in the weights, as when beaten a length into second of ten at Southwell (16.5f, Tapeta) this month; a player if able to repeat that effort back on Polytrack in returning blinkers.
Horse quote: 2024-04-08 at Newcastle (AW) (12.5f): "Yakhabar is generally held up but everything else in the race was held up also, so I thought we'd take a chance and go forward and I think that's what's won him the race - Liam Bailey, trainer."

💬 Comment: Little in three starts last year; improvement needed on handicap debut; off seven months
🔦 Spotlight: Not much to get excited about at big odds in three starts over 1m2f/1m3f on turf/Tapeta last year; up in trip for her handicap debut after seven months off and improvement needed; stable may have a better chance with Yakhabar.
