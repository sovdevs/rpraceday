🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not at best lately (including on Flat) but yard won this last year; tongue-tie added
🔦 Spotlight: Fairly useful triple hurdle winner; not at best on his last two hurdle starts (beaten 15l when third latterly) and also well held on AW Flat a fortnight ago but this is a bit less competitive and his yard won the race last year; has a first-time tongue-tie added to the cheekpieces he's worn recently.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two chase wins this autumn and remained in form since; 🔥 big player back hurdling
🔦 Spotlight: Two chase wins over 2m1f at Kelso (good/good to soft) in the autumn; creditable efforts at Wetherby (2m3f/1m7f) on his last two outings and has a lower mark to work with back hurdling; probably the one to beat.
