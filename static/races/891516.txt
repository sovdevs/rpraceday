🔦 Spotlight: 0-6; just a modest handicap debut at Sandown in September but she had shown promise in maiden company previously and was a persistent third at Wolverhampton (extended 1m1f) in October; this stiffer test can suit and Oisin Murphy (2-9 for trainer) is booked; hood refitted.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Took advantage of major weights drop when AW winner in March; not so good next time
🔦 Spotlight: Had plunged in the weights after a terrible 2024 for Ian Williams and Patrick Morris and he took full advantage at Wolverhampton (extended 1m1f) in March, landing a touch on second run back with this yard; not in the same form there since and hard to know whether refitted cheekpieces will be any help (they weren't in three previous tries).

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won twice at 1m2f in second half of 2024; below best final 2 starts; possible reviver
🔦 Spotlight: Found his feet for refitting of blinkers and return to 1m2f in the second half of 2024, winning over C&D (good) and, after a break, at Brighton (good to soft); never on his game for either of his subsequent starts but it could be a different story back here for yard that won this in 2021.
Horse quote: 2024-07-06 at Leicester (10f): "Everything went quite smoothly with Little Tiger.  I tried to go forward, but there was a bit of pace on, and as he's been running over further he couldn't go with them.  He came off the bridle a long way out, and I saw the best of him once hitting the rising ground - Edward Greatrex, rider, speaking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced maiden who ran a couple of fair races on AW when first handicapping, then quite seriously hampered at Doncaster (1m2f, good to soft) in March; however, has more to prove on a subsequent defeat at Nottingham.

🔦 Spotlight: Five most recent wins on AW and he doesn't run much on turf these days, the losing run going back nearly six years; has plenty to find after a weak effort back on grass at Nottingham this month.
Horse quote: 2019-07-30 at Goodwood (5f): "That was a good performance by Green Power. We wanted to try him over five furlongs, so we decided to run him here and see how he got on. We have the Shergar Cup in mind for him next and he won at that meeting last year - John Gallagher, trainer."
