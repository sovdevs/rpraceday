💬 Comment: Winning hurdler; as good over fences despite being 0-5 and can improve for comeback run
🔦 Spotlight: Winner of a point and novice hurdle (2m4f, soft); every bit as good over fences despite being 0-5 and made a pleasing return from 300 days away when second at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy); very capable of defying this untouched mark.

💬 Comment: Newbury winner two runs back but ran no race last time; jumping remains an issue
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't jump all that well when a short-head winner at Newbury (2m, good to soft; won on softer) and found zero fluency over his fences when running no race at Haydock three weeks ago; perhaps the steadier pace of a longer race may help his jumping.

💬 Comment: Off the mark over fences at Exeter; up 4lb in a race that may take more winning
🔦 Spotlight: Enhanced his good record at Exeter when digging deep to make it third-time lucky over fences there on New Year's Day (2m3f, soft); this looks a stronger race and he's gone up 4lb, but clearly a contender arriving here on the back of a win.

💬 Comment: 1lb above last winning hurdle mark but he didn't get very far on recent chase debut
🔦 Spotlight: Perhaps flattered to win a Warwick handicap hurdle by so far last March (3m2f, soft) but back down to just a 1lb higher mark; however, that's for a reason and not ideal that he fell so early on recent chase debut.

🔦 Spotlight: Winner of a point and novice hurdle (2m4f, soft); every bit as good over fences despite being 0-5 and made a pleasing return from 300 days away when second at Ffos Las (2m5f, heavy); very capable of defying this untouched mark.

💬 Comment: Newbury winner two runs back but ran no race last time; jumping remains an issue
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't jump all that well when a short-head winner at Newbury (2m, good to soft; won on softer) and found zero fluency over his fences when running no race at Haydock three weeks ago; perhaps the steadier pace of a longer race may help his jumping.
