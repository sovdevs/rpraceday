🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Spectacular in the Supreme here in 2022 and this race in 2023; still unbeaten under rules
🔦 Spotlight: Acts on any ground; plagued with issues last year but has returned from his absence in encouraging fettle, albeit without showing best RPRs, bagging a third Christmas Hurdle at Kempton then cantering home in Grade 2 contest at Cheltenham (straightforward task; final-flight mistake was a rare error); breezed clear of two stablemates in a racecourse gallop at Kempton two weeks ago; still unbeaten under rules and sets a tall standard on peak form, which includes spectacular performances in the Supreme here in 2022 and this race in 2023, both times looking one of the modern greats; very hard to beat provided he's still capable of that brilliance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Scintillating performance at Leopardstown last time; highly talented and 📈 progressive mare
🔦 Spotlight: Met her sole defeat at this meeting last year (finished second) but the race wasn't run to suit and she still emerged best at the weights; rallied gamely to beat State Man in the Morgiana (soft) on penultimate start, then produced a scintillating performance at Leopardstown (2m, good to yielding) where she powered clear once taking the lead from pacesetting stablemate King Of Kingsfield and produced a winning margin (30l) that is rare at Grade 1 level, recording a fast time to boot; highly talented and 📈 progressive mare who commands major respect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a substandard edition of this race last year; no match for Constitution Hill in 2023
🔦 Spotlight: Beaten twice by Brighterdaysahead this season, flopping badly on the second occasion, and was gifted a third Irish Champion Hurdle last month as main rival Lossiemouth fell; won a substandard edition of this race last year and was no match for highly impressive Constitution Hill 12 months earlier; dependable in the main and has a voluminous Grade 1 tally but a second Champion Hurdle win looks far from certain; wears first-time headgear.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won last time but unlikely to repeat 2024 Cheltenham Festival win over Brighterdaysahead
🔦 Spotlight: Very useful mare who beat Brighterdaysahead at this meeting 12 months ago but that rival was unsuited by the steady pace, has subsequently shown the greater progress and now gets a 5lb pull; gamely beat Burdett Road in the Kingwell at Wincanton (1m7f, good to soft) most recently, proving suited by the drop back from 2m4f and maintaining her consistent level of form; a lot to find on ratings.

🔦 Spotlight: Made all in the Greatwood (on good ground) in November when looking particularly well handicapped on his Flat form and taking C&D record to 2-2; ran well on bare figures in the Christmas Hurdle but is comfortably held by Constitution Hill on that result; close second to Golden Ace in the Kingwell at Wincanton most recently, showing no further progress; faces a stiffer task and competition for the lead returned to Grade 1 level.
