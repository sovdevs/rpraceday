🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 7yo; has made very good start to chase career and could have more to offer
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced point winner who won a maiden hurdle here (2m5f, good) last May and belated followed up on his chase debut at Wincanton (3m1f, good to soft) last month; clear second to highly 📈 progressive winner here (3m, good to soft) a fortnight ago when travelling strongly, and he could have more to offer for his top yard now back down in trip.

💬 Comment: Has easily made all the last twice and this thriving 7yo could prove tough to catch
🔦 Spotlight: Had wind op prior to Carlisle in October, when pulled up and found to have a wound on his right-hind; major improvement the next twice when easily making all at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) and Ffos Las (2m, soft); deserves extra credit for latest win as he jumped to the right at that left-handed track; seemed fine at 2m4f last March; thriving and could prove tough to catch.

🔦 Spotlight: 6yo who is capable of winning a race like this should everything click, and he was disputing the lead in first-time blinkers (retained) when falling five out at Ascot last month (from 5lb out of the handicap); however, he's 0-12 in Britain and last time wasn't the first occasion he's had jumping issues.

🔦 Spotlight: His form has been mixed since he landed 2m/1m7f a hat-trick last winter and he's unproven on the forecast good ground; however, he was back on song with a close third of six at Sandown (1m7f, heavy) three weeks ago and he's run well at up to 2m4f over hurdles; possible player if handling conditions.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: The drop in trip is a plus, and also down in the weights, but others are more compelling
🔦 Spotlight: Now 9lb lower than when runner-up at Plumpton (2m3f, good) last April and he ran okay at Sandown last month when not seeing out the 3m trip; however, this 10yo has been well beaten more often than not over the last two seasons and others are more compelling.
