🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Second over hurdles in France last summer and makes British debut in very ordinary race
🔦 Spotlight: Out of a useful French Flat-racer who has produced a handful of winning jumpers; shaped with significant promise when second of ten on debut in France last summer (2m3f, good to soft) and makes British debut in a very ordinary race; hood added.

💬 Comment: Irish point winner who was placed on first three hurdling starts; leading contender here
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who has been placed on all three hurdling starts this season, most recently when third of 14 at Taunton (2m, good) a fortnight ago; tends to race a bit too freely and his form isn't anything to go wild about but he's a leading contender here.
