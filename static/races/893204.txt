🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back on track latest when runner-up in his second chase (3m1f); chance
🔦 Spotlight: Awarded Chepstow maiden hurdle in early 2024; lost his way after but back on track in newly applied cheekpieces at Hereford (3m1f, good) latest when runner-up on second chase start; chance.
Horse quote: 2024-01-24 at Chepstow (19.5f): "I was delighted to get it as we've been having so many seconds lately. I wasn't convinced we'd get it watching it live, but my mind changed after seeing the replay. House Of Stories was badly interfered with and it might have stayed the same had he been beaten a neck, but he was only done by a nose. He's a really nice horse who's going to make a cracking chaser. Staying trips will be his game and he loves this testing ground. He's definitely one for the future - Rebecca Curtis, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Exeter maiden hurdle winner (2m6f) last April; returns to fences at a realistic level.
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m6f maiden hurdle at Exeter but minimal impact in handicaps since and fifth of six finishers at Wincanton recently; dam was a 3m-4m chase winner, though, so this second start over fences could offer a way forward.
Horse quote: 2024-04-07 at Exeter (21.5f): "Howaya Now has ground it out really. He wouldn't be the most straightforward of horses, he's a bit idle and can be a bit ignorant with his jumping, but they've found the right race and tuned him up as he's been hitting the bar all season.  It was a good decision to come back over hurdles after the chasing didn't go to plan and it's great they've got a win into him - Harry Bannister, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Exeter maiden hurdle winner (2m6f) last April; returns to fences at a realistic level.
🔦 Spotlight: Won 2m6f maiden hurdle at Exeter but minimal impact in handicaps since and fifth of six finishers at Wincanton recently; dam was a 3m-4m chase winner, though, so this second start over fences could offer a way forward.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Showed more verve in refitted cheekpeices at Warwick latest but others still more obvious.
🔦 Spotlight: Has been a fine servant to connections; now 12lb lower than when scoring at Perth (3m, good) last summer and showed more verve in refitted cheekpieces at Warwick (3m5f, good) last time; others still more obvious.
Horse quote: 2023-02-18 at Ascot (24f): "Cap Du Nord is  unbelievable, he's only rated 127 but he means as much to me as a 160-rated horse. He toes-in quite badly so he was never a sales horse, he was sold to us without going to the sales but he wins a big race for us every year. Every time he gets above 130 he can't win for us, it's clear for everyone to see once it drops below that he usually ends up winning - Christian Williams, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 100-1 winner here (2m6f) in December; bitterly disappointing next two starts
🔦 Spotlight: Sprung a 100-1 surprise over 2m6f here (heavy; off 3lb lower) on stable debut in December; bitterly disappointing when toiling at Leicester and pulling up at Exeter since; due to run 6.15 here yesterday with tongue-tie replacing a hood; blinkers now added.
Horse quote: 2024-12-19 at Ffos Las (21.5f): "We put a few quid on Karuma Grey, not a lot. The bookmakers got the price wrong - he loves wet ground. I reckon he is a Saturday horse if we can get him right. Shane came back and said he could be a Welsh National horse for next year - Aled Evans, owner, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
