🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In career-best form in first-time visor at Carlisle this month, winning by 6l; up 7lb
🔦 Spotlight: Bounced back quickly from last month's poor performance and took form to whole new level at Carlisle (2m3f, good to soft; first-time visor) three weeks ago, keeping on strongly to win readily by 6l; went up 7lb for that but must be considered in current mood.

🔦 Spotlight: Useful chaser who won twice over 2m1f at Kelso (good/good to soft) in the autumn and posted a sound effort when second of four (albeit no threat to winner) off his lower hurdle mark here (2m1f, good to soft; refitted cheekpieces) this month; also suited by 2m4f; probably won't be far away.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Four 2m1f wins last term; ran well over that trip last month; not fully exposed over 2m4f
🔦 Spotlight: Made very good progress last season, collecting four 2m1f wins (three here) along the way; lightly raced this term but last month's third here (2m1f, good to soft) was perfectly respectable and he could plausibly have untapped potential over 2m4f.
