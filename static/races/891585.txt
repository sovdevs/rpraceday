Horse quote: 2021-06-12 at Sandown (8f): "Trais Fluors was beaten by a good horse in Brentford Hope at Nottingham last time. He was suited by the better ground here, which was key. He carried a lot of weight but felt a lot better today - Silvestre de Sousa, rider."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pulled too hard when sixth of nine here three days ago; needs to settle better.
🔦 Spotlight: All three wins have been on turf and she was unfortunate when slowly away after her blindfold came off late when staying on to finish third of nine at Thirsk (6f, good to firm) nine days ago; pulled too hard when sixth of nine here (6f, good) three days ago; needs to settle over this extra furlong.
Horse quote: 2022-05-20 at Haydock (7f): "Inanna is a very nice filly. It was a nice fair track and we decided to send her up there because she had time to organiser herself. She could drop back, she is pretty versatile, but they didn't go much of a gallop. We like her at home and we will see how she comes out of the race. We have a nice bunch of horses, we have kept the numbers down, but hopefully the two-year-olds will be nice - Sean Woods, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Got off the mark on turf here last May and won again at Musselburgh in October.
🔦 Spotlight: Got off the mark on turf here (1m, good to firm) last May and won again at Musselburgh (7f, good to soft) in October; never on terms when seventh of ten on seasonal debut at Musselburgh (7f, good) last month and may need to come down a few pounds.
Horse quote: 2020-03-13 at Dundalk (AW) (10.5f): "Golden Valour is much better than his mark. I thought he wasn't helping Donagh up the straight but it was hard work in that wind. There's a valuable handicap here next month which we might go for - Richard O'Brien, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has tumbled down the weights and only tenth of 13 at Thirsk nine days ago.
🔦 Spotlight: Has tumbled down the weights and due to go down a further 4lb after today; the return of a tongue-tie and switch from cheekpieces to visor (retained) did little to halt his decline when tenth of 13 at Thirsk (7f, good to firm) nine days ago; others preferred.
