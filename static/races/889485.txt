🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over 3m2f at Kelso last May; not so good after; back after a break with a bit to prove
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark in a 3m2f Kelso handicap last May when visored for the first time (good to soft); well below that form next three starts (second was over fences); returns after 159-day break with a bit to prove.
