🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Good win at Southwell two starts ago and going back left-handed today can be a positive
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who won in good style at Southwell (2m, good) in November on his second chase start; soundly beaten at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) since but he jumped to the left at that right-handed track and today's return to a left-handed circuit could be a major positive for his claims.

💬 Comment: Out of form this season but now 3lb lower than when winning this last year; likes it here
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on his three runs this season, including here on his reappearance; however, all four wins have come here and he's 3lb lower than when taking this last year; big chance if the return to Plumpton and the first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) prompt a revival.

💬 Comment: Good win at Southwell two starts ago and going back left-handed today can be a positive
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who won in good style at Southwell (2m, good) in November on his second chase start; soundly beaten at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) since but he jumped to the left at that right-handed track and today's return to a left-handed circuit could be a major positive for his claims.

🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on his three runs this season, including here on his reappearance; however, all four wins have come here and he's 3lb lower than when taking this last year; big chance if the return to Plumpton and the first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) prompt a revival.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Out of form this season but now 3lb lower than when winning this last year; likes it here
🔦 Spotlight: Well beaten on his three runs this season, including here on his reappearance; however, all four wins have come here and he's 3lb lower than when taking this last year; big chance if the return to Plumpton and the first-time visor (replacing cheekpieces) prompt a revival.

💬 Comment: Good win at Southwell two starts ago and going back left-handed today can be a positive
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 6yo who won in good style at Southwell (2m, good) in November on his second chase start; soundly beaten at Ludlow (2m, good to soft) since but he jumped to the left at that right-handed track and today's return to a left-handed circuit could be a major positive for his claims.
