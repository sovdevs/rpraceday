üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: üìà progressive last year on the Flat and did everything right in winning her maiden hurdle
üî¶ Spotlight: After one run she's light on hurdling experience for a test of this magnitude, but she jumped impeccably when winning at Fairyhouse (yielding to soft) and we know she's talented having beaten a good horse in a bumper before progressing so well on the Flat last year (third in the Irish Cesarewitch on good ground); appears to have a high cruising speed and an ability to quicken, which could provide a telling late challenge.

üí¨ Comment: 4yo filly who is getting a weight allowance and would have had a fair shout in the Triumph
üî¶ Spotlight: Only 1-8 on the Flat but she was well up to Listed level and consistent; runner-up in both her hurdle races and she's a major player judged on her strong finish behind leading Triumph contender Hello Neighbour in a Grade 1 at Leopardstown last month (soft; fine on drier ground); 4yos have never threatened in this race (0-8) but none traded at shorter than 20-1 and six were no-hopers; interesting with her age allowance given she wouldn't have been out of place in the Grade 1 Triumph.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: 6-9 under rules; workmanlike in a Grade 3 last time but can no doubt improve further
üî¶ Spotlight: It's in her blood to win at Cheltenham, as a daughter of multiple Festival winner Quevega and a sister to Facile Vega who won the Champion Bumper and finished second in a Supreme; she's not yet in their league and not by a long chalk, but she is 6-9 under rules after bagging a Grade 3 at Fairyhouse in January (2m2f, soft; has won on good); that was more workmanlike than super-stylish but she's very much in the reckoning with Paul Townend up top.

üóûÔ∏è **PRESS OPINION**
üí¨ Comment: It was a winnable maiden that she won at Fairyhouse but she's going the right way
üî¶ Spotlight: French bumper form makes for very good reading and she made amends for a surprise debut defeat over hurdles with a comfortable success in a winnable race on heavy ground at Fairyhouse; there are possible ground issues (best form has been on very soft or heavy) but she's clearly open to further progress for her top team and has not been without ante-post support.

üî¶ Spotlight: Beat all except Diva Luna in the Grade 2 bumper for mares at last season's Grand National meeting; came up short in a Listed race on hurdling debut (though was eyecatching) and has comfortably won her subsequent races, the latest at Windsor's Winter Million festival (soft, effective on good to soft) when conceding weight to Bluey; there's a suspicion that she'll hold her own but ultimately come up short, though her trainer isn't thinking along those lines.

üí¨ Comment: Hurdling career has yet really to take off but her good bumper form brings her into this
üî¶ Spotlight: Beat Jubilee Alpha in the Grade 2 bumper for mares at Aintree last April and that form heightens interest; it's been an underwhelming start over hurdles despite the positive form figures, but she did win her maiden here (2m4f) and the ground was very testing when she came up shy under a penalty at Sandown (2m); her trainer believes she has turned a corner since and her raw ability needs respect; has raced on only soft or heavy ground.
