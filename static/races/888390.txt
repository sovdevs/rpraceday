🔦 Spotlight: 2-31 under rules (0-15 on the Flat), but only beaten a short head at Chelmsford (2m, Polytrack) last month and looked unfortunate not to go closer when beaten less than 3l behind Further Measure here (2m) the time before; 6lb better off with that rival and shouldn't be far away.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bids for a hat-trick from a 3lb higher mark; has stamina to prove but on an upward curve
🔦 Spotlight: Seems to have benefited from wind surgery, winning a 0-50 classified event at Kempton (1m3f, Polytrack) in January and narrowly following up in a handicap there (1m4f) three weeks later (form worked out well); 3lb higher and tackles this far for the first time, but he is on an upwards curve; respected.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won a poor four-runner novice at Wolverhampton in January; has twice been well held since
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 2m4f hurdle for Fergal O'Brien in September and made a winning debut for this yard at Wolverhampton (9.5f, Tapeta) in January; however, the form of that four-runner novice was very weak and she has twice been well held since.
