💬 Comment: 10lb higher than at Wincanton and has drier ground to deal with; still a major player
🔦 Spotlight: Hit and miss since sent chasing but he powered clear last time at Wincanton (soft) for a 10l success; that's triggered a 10lb hike which asks a question on this drier ground; much respected nonetheless.
