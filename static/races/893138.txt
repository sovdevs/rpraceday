🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Didn't show much under rules in Britain but won a point since; may find this sharp
🔦 Spotlight: Didn't show much under rules in Britain but got off the mark with a point win in November; will probably find this test sharp and may need the run after a five-month break.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bumper winner but has lost her way and failed to complete last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner but has lost her way since a maiden hurdle 5th at Kilbeggan last August and failed to complete on last two runs, including back over timber last week; reliant on first-time cheekpieces sparking a revival.
Horse quote: 2024-05-24 at Downpatrick (18f): "Pepperpots works real well at home. We ran her in a few point-to-points and she just wasn't getting the three miles. We ran her in Tipperary in a mares' point-to-point bumper and she finished seventh. I'd say she needed the run from a point-to-point field to a bumper - Barry John Walsh, trainer/jockey."
