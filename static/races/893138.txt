🔦 Spotlight: Maiden hurdle winner at Thurles in 2022 but losing run since; back in form with a respectable third at Limerick last week and has an each-way squeak again but others probably on better marks.
Horse quote: 2022-11-03 at Thurles (16f): "Navy Waves is only a small filly. I had to sit and suffer but it opened up on the inner and she plugged away - Evan Dwan, rider."

🔦 Spotlight: Minor signs of ability when fourth of eight at Killarney on her penultimate run; tailed off subsequently and hasn't shown enough to suggest she can defy this opening mark; off 179 days.

💬 Comment: Bumper winner but has lost her way and failed to complete last twice
🔦 Spotlight: Bumper winner but has lost her way since a maiden hurdle 5th at Kilbeggan last August and failed to complete on last two runs, including back over timber last week; reliant on first-time cheekpieces sparking a revival.
Horse quote: 2024-05-24 at Downpatrick (18f): "Pepperpots works real well at home. We ran her in a few point-to-points and she just wasn't getting the three miles. We ran her in Tipperary in a mares' point-to-point bumper and she finished seventh. I'd say she needed the run from a point-to-point field to a bumper - Barry John Walsh, trainer/jockey."
