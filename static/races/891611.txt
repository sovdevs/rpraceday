🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed 4yo who progressed nicely in 2024; absence to defy but still of some interest
🔦 Spotlight: The switch to handicaps and addition of a tongue-tie saw him make good progress last summer, winning at Newmarket (6f, good to firm) and Doncaster (7f, good to firm); could have more progress in him this year and he's quick enough to deal with the return to sprinting; good chance.
Horse quote: 2024-08-03 at Doncaster (7f): "Waleefy is maturing throughout the campaign. He seems to be improving all the time and things went right for him, even if the ground was a little quick. Going up to a mile should suit and he's exciting - Cieren Fallon, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 2 solid runs in 2025; can go well but would make more appeal on softer going; new headgear
🔦 Spotlight: His four turf wins have come on slower than good, the latest a narrow defeat of Capote's Dream at Newbury last October (6f, heavy); two encouraging runs this year and the switch to blinkers could spark extra; good chance if the ground doesn't dry out too much.

💬 Comment: Sharper for his return and has run well over C&D in the past; good claimer booked; chance
🔦 Spotlight: Hasn't won away from Newmarket since the summer of 2022; satisfactory return to action at Newmarket two weeks ago (5f, good) and the return to 6f will help; promising 7lb claimer rides for the first time; should go well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Dual C&D winner; drying ground not ideal but this mark no issue on even last year's best
🔦 Spotlight: Finally exploited his drop in the weights when winning a C&D handicap last October (heavy ground); should come on for March's return to action at Doncaster and while slower ground would be ideal, he did run well in a fast-ground Stewards' Cup in 2020.
Horse quote: 2023-05-06 at Newmarket (6f): "Chairmanoftheboard has run a stormer. He is not ungenuine but we put the cheekpieces on just to try and sweeten him up. He has travelled beautifully and picked up well and hit the front but the winner has really finished fast past him. He is a cracking older horse and one day he will get his head in front in one of these. We will be looking at races like the Wokingham and Stewards' Cup with him, if they come up soft - Jack Channon, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 1lb lower than for last summer's Yarmouth win; out of sorts in Bahrain this winter
🔦 Spotlight: Inconsistent 6yo but he has plenty of talent, as witnessed at Yarmouth last summer when he powered home to win a Racing League handicap (6f, good to firm) off a 1lb higher mark; out of sorts in Bahrain over the winter; can win a nice prize this year but not sure this race will set up ideally for his hold-up style.

💬 Comment: Infrequent winner in recent years; conditions fine but others appeal more for win purposes
🔦 Spotlight: Just one win since August 2021; fully effective over C&D and the ground shouldn't be an issue; ran respectably on his reappearance last month but suspicion he'll find a couple too strong once again.
Horse quote: 2023-08-05 at Goodwood (6f): "Capote's Dream ran super. The race came over to the far side, and he is a horse that likes to come through them. I would have loved to have got out two strides earlier, and it probably suited him in that regard - Tom Marquand, jockey."

💬 Comment: Returns from an absence off a good mark but unplaced in ten Goodwood visits
🔦 Spotlight: Veteran who has been absent for 439 days; he has been given a chance by the handicapper and returns with his stable in better form than when last seen; would be more interesting were it not for his record of having been unplaced in all ten Goodwood runs.
Horse quote: 2023-03-03 at Lingfield (AW) (6f): "Count Otto has been a legend for us. It's taken a couple of runs to get him back to himself after he had an injury last year, and I wasn't sure he was quite there yet, but it was great to see him win. He prefers a track with a turn so Lingfield suits him well. We'll look at the Sprint on Finals Day now and hopefully get him in the Stewards' Cup or consolation race at Goodwood in the summer - Amanda Perrett, trainer."
