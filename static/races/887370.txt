💬 Comment: Placed on all four starts for this stable including three runs on the AW elsewhere
🔦 Spotlight: Placed on all four starts for this stable, including three runs on the AW elsewhere this winter; sent off favourite last two goes; didn't see out 9.4f having been headstrong in front latest so this drop back in trip looks a wise move.
