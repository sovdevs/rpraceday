üî¶ Spotlight: üìà progressive hurdles form in France culminated in a hat-trick last spring, the final leg in Listed event at Auteuil (2m2f, very soft; won going away); potentially on a lenient opening mark and, in keeping with the ante-post betting, looks very interesting on debut for Willie Mullins.
