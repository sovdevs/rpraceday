💬 Comment: Stayed on well to win a 6f maiden here 13 days ago; penalty to defy but looks a key player
🔦 Spotlight: Third over 7f on her Kempton debut last October; off the mark dropped to 6f here 13 days ago, not looking an easy ride but powering home to lead late on; return to 7f should suit; respected despite her penalty.

🔦 Spotlight: Chased home the red-hot favourite at Leicester on her only start for George Scott last year (7f, good to firm); just missed out in a blanket finish at Brighton on recent stable debut (6f, good to firm); should benefit from going back up in distance.

🔦 Spotlight: Nice pedigree and notable that she was sent off favourite for her 2yo debut at Newcastle (7f), running well for second despite looking in need of the experience; can't rate that form too highly though and she'll need improvement to take this after ten months off.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Modest form in one 2yo run (7f, Tapeta); improvement may come when upped in distance
🔦 Spotlight: 28-1 for her Wolverhampton debut (7f) 200 days ago, a race where she raced freely and was always behind; should leave that behind her in time but longer trips will suit better.

💬 Comment: Half-sister to five winners out of 1m-1m2f winner; yard not renowned for debutante winners
🔦 Spotlight: 6,500gns yearling; eighth foal; half-sister to five winners including Whispered Kiss (7f/1m including AW; RPR 91), Delicate Kiss (1m including AW; 89) and Kiss And Run (5f/5.7f; 81); dam 1m-1m2f winner (including AW; 95); stable not renowned for winning newcomers but worth a 📊 market check.
