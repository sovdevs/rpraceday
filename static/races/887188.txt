🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Hat-trick before heavy defeat in valuable handicap in July; fine chance on best 2024 form
🔦 Spotlight: Won two hunter chases over about 2m5f last spring before adding a handicap in June; not seen since heavy defeat in a valuable handicap in July; more to prove on heavy but one of those 2024 wins was by a street on soft ground, and he has a fine chance on that form.
