💬 Comment: Jumped better when making all at Warwick; has the penalty but this race has no depth
🔦 Spotlight: Learned from a ropey round of jumping on hurdling debut as she was better when making all at Warwick (2m3f, good to soft); Toby McCain-Mitchell's claim erases the penalty and dropping back to nearly 2m shouldn't be a problem in this company.
