🔦 Spotlight: Well held over 7f this winter but he wasn't disgraced in a higher grade at Wolverhampton recently and is 5lb lower than for eased-down 1m2f win at Chelmsford last April (in cheekpieces; they return for the first time since May); Rossa Ryan up for the first time (0-7 for the yard); check market.

🔦 Spotlight: In peak form after four wins in 2025, at 1m4f (twice here) and 1m6f; needs to transfer that form back to 1m2f as she's 11lb higher than when second over C&D on most recent attempt at the trip in the autumn but that's not out of the question.
