🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a long losing run; ran well over 6f on AW latest; new headgear but drawn widest
🔦 Spotlight: No win since 2022 but he's capable at this level and comes here on the back of a good front-running third of 13 at Newcastle three weeks ago (6f, AW); new cheekpieces may help but the widest draw won't.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Looked good on occasions last year; sharper for Southwell return; new headgear today
🔦 Spotlight: Threatened to be a bit better than this level on occasions last season, looking good when winning at Haydock last July (5f, good); disappointing at Southwell on his return to action last month but the run may have been needed after six months off; the fitting of cheekpieces could sharpen him up too and he's high on the list.
Horse quote: 2024-07-06 at Haydock (5f): "I thought Cloud King would enjoy a bit of dig in the ground. There's a good enough headwind out there and they went a good gallop, and looking around waiting, I thought I had everything covered - Rossa Ryan, rider."

💬 Comment: Runs the track well and had excuses on his reappearance; best on slower than good though
🔦 Spotlight: Course winner (6f) who ended 2024 with a couple of good thirds on soft ground; not a lot went right for him over C&D on his return to action three weeks ago and that run can be safely ignored; capable of making an impact off this mark but others might prove better suited by the drying ground.

💬 Comment: Drew a blank last year but often ran well; good draw on stable debut; considered
🔦 Spotlight: Won two sprint nurseries as a 2yo; bright start to 2024 but he struggled in midsummer and wasn't able to exploit a reduced mark in the autumn; sold out of the Muir/Grassick stable for 48,000gns in October; well drawn to attack and he's a player on his stable debut.

💬 Comment: Went close over C&D this month before finishing 3rd at Wolverhampton; each-way shout
🔦 Spotlight: On a competitive mark and he missed out narrowly over C&D 16 days ago, racing wide and just failing to claw back the winner; beaten favourite at Wolverhampton nine days ago but still ran creditably; 1lb higher today but holds each-way claims.
Horse quote: 2023-05-12 at Ripon (5f): "He did it well. Reigning Profit broke very quickly so I travelled strongly through the race and I think he was just getting a little tired near the line - James Sullivan, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

💬 Comment: Two front-running 5f wins last year; promising return over 6f; key player back at 5f
🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who made all in 5f handicaps at Redcar (good to firm) and Thirsk (good to soft) last summer; shaped well on his return to action at Thirsk 18 days ago (6f, good); key player back at 5f and from stall 1.
Horse quote: 2024-07-17 at Thirsk (5f): "Ingleby Archie was getting warm in the saddling boxes and while it was humid in there I admitted to the owner it was a bit of a worry. On last year's form he looks quite well handicapped but it took a couple of runs to get going - Adrain Nicholls, trainer."

Horse quote: 2024-07-27 at York (5f): "That was very different and a great thrill. It's a race I've wanted to ride in for the last two years but couldn't get a ride.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed at 5f but his return was low-key and he looks on a tough mark
🔦 Spotlight: He didn't have to improve on his turf form to make a winning AW debut at Newcastle in November (first run at 5f); 🔍 unexposed at the trip but down the field on his return and he looks on a tough mark.
