🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won by 14l at Leicester last month and should be fine on the faster ground here
🔦 Spotlight: Dual hurdle winner who drew 14l clear to open her chasing account at Leicester (2m4f, heavy) last month; should be fine on the forecast faster ground here and a chunk of her recent 8lb rise is offset by Callum Pritchard's very useful 5lb claim; good chance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-9 over hurdles but came second in the autumn; a possible on today's chasing debut
🔦 Spotlight: 0-9 over hurdles but her second at Leicester (1m7f, good to soft) in the autumn was a pretty good effort and she didn't run badly when fourth at Southwell (2m4f, good to soft) last month; can have a say if she jumps adequately on this chasing debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled in three novice/maiden hurdles in the autumn; makes chase/handicap debut here
🔦 Spotlight: Came third in two Irish points in 2022 but, following a long absence, struggled to get competitive in three novice/maiden hurdles (2m-2m4f) in the autumn; makes chase/handicap debut from a lowly mark but still needs to improve.
