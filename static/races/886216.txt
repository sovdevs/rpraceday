🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 20-1 win at Catterick last month on second chase start and a 6lb rise might not stop him
🔦 Spotlight: Having been struggling for form he staged a revival with a 20-1 win at Catterick (2m3f, good to soft) last month on his second chase start; a 6lb rise might not stop him if he can repeat that performance.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not written off now back down in trip on his second start back from a break
🔦 Spotlight: 10yo who has been pulled up the last twice but he ran well for a fair way over hurdles last time following a break, over a 3m trip that probably stretches him; now 2lb lower than when runner-up over fences at Cartmel last June and he's not written off.

🔦 Spotlight: Won off this mark at Catterick (2m3f, soft) last February and went close later that month; however, this 11yo has struggled to get competitive since; major turnaround needed with blinkers replacing cheekpieces.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: In good form here prior to Carlisle, when stretched by that stiff 2m5f on soft ground
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Carlisle (2m4f, good) in November and runner-up over this C&D the next twice (good to soft/soft); below par at Carlisle a fortnight ago but that stiff 2m5f on soft ground may have stretched her; runner-up on four of her five visits to Musselburgh and could have a part to play now back here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has a regressive profile but his mark continues to fall and he might not be far away
🔦 Spotlight: Has a regressive profile but his mark continues to fall; creditable third over fences at Hexham (1m7f, soft) in October and didn't run badly over hurdles at Sedgefield (2m4f, good to soft) recently following a two-month break; might not be far away now back chasing.

🔦 Spotlight: Made it 0-5 over fences when pulled up at Catterick last month but this course hurdle winner was running well in chases previously, finishing second at Sedgefield two starts ago; in the mix if bouncing back.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Fair third at Catterick latest but needs bigger run today if he's to break his duck
🔦 Spotlight: Having tumbled down the weights he returned to form with a fair third of six at Catterick in December in first-time cheekpieces/tongue-tie (both retained) on his fourth stable start; however, he needs a bigger run today if he's to break his duck at the 18th attempt.

🔦 Spotlight: 9yo point winner who is 0-7 under rules but there were encouraging signs over fences last winter and he shaped on his comeback over hurdles two months ago as though he would improve for that run; he's one to consider.
