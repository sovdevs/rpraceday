💬 Comment: Third of five in Grade 2 mares' novice last month; has potential off her opening mark
🔦 Spotlight: All six starts on soft/heavy ground; this two-time bumper winner (including here) scored easily at Ffos Las (2m) in December on her second hurdle start before a creditable third of five in a Grade 2 mares' novice at Sandown (2m4f) last month; has potential off her opening mark, if conditions suit.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 🔍 unexposed point/maiden hurdle winner who now goes handicapping with yard in excellent form
🔦 Spotlight: Point winner (3m, soft) who returned from an absence to post promising fourth on hurdle debut at Warwick (2m3f, good to soft) in January; had to work hard to win at 2-5 at Lingfield (2m3f, heavy) last month but could have plenty more to offer and her yard is in excellent form; handicap debut.

💬 Comment: 7l second on handicap debut at Taunton and the winner has followed up; on the shortlist
🔦 Spotlight: Took a step forward when upped in trip and runner-up on last month's handicap debut at Taunton (2m3f, good to soft); she was no match for the winner but that one has won since, as has the third; this lightly raced 5yo could continue to improve and she's on the shortlist.
