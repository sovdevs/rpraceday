🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well held at Leopardstown after Navan victory; will like the ground and may bounce back
🔦 Spotlight: C&D success was the middle leg of a hat-trick of handicap wins as 4yo; bit high in the ratings subsequently; handicapper gave him a chance which he duly availed of at Navan in November; well held at Leopardstown over Christmas; will like the ground and may bounce back.
