🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Points' winner beaten favourite on hurdles debut; switches to bumper and respected
🔦 Spotlight: Made easy work of a Ballycahane point-to-point a year ago before £410,000 sale; favourite on rules debut in 2m Navan maiden hurdle in December, travelling well enough until fading before the last; switches to bumper now and has to be respected.
