🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Sole win in C&D novice; running well on Tapeta until non-stayer at 1m2f since; competitive
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win in C&D novice as a 3yo; in good form on Newcastle Tapeta back from being ✂️ gelded but he again didn't see out 1m2f here in February; useful effort in a strong 1m event on Kempton Polytrack last spring suggests he'll be competitive here.
Horse quote: 2022-11-28 at Kempton (AW) (7f): "Dragon Icon is a lovely individual. It took him a few strides to get going and he picked up and I thought that was it and he was going to finish a nice fourth or fifth, but then he took off. He is a raw horse that wouldn't have been 100 per cent tuned up for this today as it was an educational experience - David Egan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Involved in another tight finish over 7f latest; yet to prove as effective at 1m
🔦 Spotlight: In good form on different AW surfaces this winter and due to go back up 2lb for another narrow defeat, over 7f at Kempton last week; however, he still needs to show he's as effective at 1m.
Horse quote: 2023-07-29 at York (6f): "Blue Prince picked up and put the race to bed very smartly. He's an improving colt who has plenty of ability in the tank - Cam Hardie, jockey."

💬 Comment: Involved in another tight finish over 7f latest; yet to prove as effective at 1m
🔦 Spotlight: In good form on different AW surfaces this winter and due to go back up 2lb for another narrow defeat, over 7f at Kempton last week; however, he still needs to show he's as effective at 1m.

🔦 Spotlight: Seemed to relish the return to Newcastle (1m) when winning easily in March but he found plenty when making it 2-2 over C&D previously and has never been in better form; on career-high mark back from short break but has to be respected again.
Horse quote: 2022-03-09 at Lingfield (AW) (8f): "Dembe missed the break and ran out a bit and got behind off a strong pace. I wasn't confident until the last 100 yards but he could come back here on Good Friday - Rossa Ryan, jockey."

💬 Comment: In good form since 1m win at Chelmsford in December, meeting one on a roll over C&D latest
🔦 Spotlight: Has continued in good form since winning at Chelmsford in December, having a healthy weights turnaround with Dembe on C&D form in January, then best of the rest behind one on a roll here in February; thereabouts.
Horse quote: 2022-10-14 at Haydock (6f): "We played the same cards as last time here and although the ground is a bit softer today, Sterling Knight has absolutely thrived on it. I started to make a move at the three pole and the only place to go was the inside. Luckily, he had plenty in the tank to get through the gaps. When he hit the front he idled and waited for something to come upsides him again. He's done it well -- Rhys Clutterbuck, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Below best on turf latest but best Tapeta and Polytrack form puts him in the picture
🔦 Spotlight: Below best returned to turf at Doncaster (in refitted cheekpieces, discarded today) but he'd only just failed at Wolverhampton (extended 1m) the time before; he's seen little Polytrack action in the last 12 months but a sustained run paid off at Kempton (1m) last April; in the picture.
Horse quote: 2024-04-01 at Kempton (AW) (8f): "Farasi Lane's homework had been brilliant and he was second here last month, which could be considered a career-best and that's amazing for a 6yo to still be improving. That's probably a career-best again and hopefully it shows what we can do with these older horses. There's a 0-90 on Guineas day I've been thinking about, although he might not get in it now - Jamie Insole, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: Just one Polytrack win back in 2023; faded over C&D behind Dembe in January; drawn widest
🔦 Spotlight: Multiple winner on turf and AW but just once on Polytrack, in 2023, and he dropped out after making much of the running behind Dembe and Kalamunda over C&D in January; has work to do from the widest draw.
Horse quote: 2023-09-09 at Kempton (AW) (8f): "It's a great result. We only ran in the Racing League because the race looked winnable. The plan had been to come here and we did think the races were a bit close together, but Helm Rock has won 70,000GBP in ten days. He's won seven now and was the most expensive yearling we've ever bought, but he's paid it back. It's taken time but he's matured mentally and every year he's come back a bit better - Daniel Kubler - co-trainer."
