🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Experienced sort, has a small penalty, ran in a Grade 1 before C&D win on latest
🔦 Spotlight: Off the mark at the third attempt over hurdles in a conditions event at Fairyhouse last month having run well in two maidens; respectable sixth of eight behind Hello Neighbour in Grade 1 at Dublin Racing Festival; a week later, made all and showed a good attitude to win a seven-runner rated hurdle over C&D.
