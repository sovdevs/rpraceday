💬 Comment: Showed promise behind a smart rival at Kempton and this looks a good opportunity
🔦 Spotlight: By Dubawi and he's out of a Group-placed 1m winner (105); beaten 6l when fourth of 13 at Kempton (7f) last month but that was behind a smart rival and he ran well for a long way; should improve for that experience and he's a 🔥 big player in this ordinary race; tongue-tie added.
