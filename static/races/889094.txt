🔦 Spotlight: Sister to smart performers Latrobe (Irish Derby) and Pink Dogwood (Listed, Oaks runner-up), half-sister to four winners including Group 3 scorer Diamond Fields; dam Listed-placed 6f winner; promising debut over 1m here in December, having to come wide in straight but every chance when just denied; bred to improve for this longer trip and could be the one to beat.
