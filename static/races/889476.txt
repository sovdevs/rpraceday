💬 Comment: Lacked fluency and was slightly disappointing last month but has 5-15 record over fences
🔦 Spotlight: 5-15 over fences (including two good-ground wins); lacked fluency and was slightly disappointing when returned to chasing at Bangor (2m1f, good) a fortnight ago but a subsequent 3lb drop is helpful and he can be very dangerous here if the first-time cheekpieces have any positive effect.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lacked fluency and was slightly disappointing last month but has 5-15 record over fences
🔦 Spotlight: 5-15 over fences (including two good-ground wins); lacked fluency and was slightly disappointing when returned to chasing at Bangor (2m1f, good) a fortnight ago but a subsequent 3lb drop is helpful and he can be very dangerous here if the first-time cheekpieces have any positive effect.
