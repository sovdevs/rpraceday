🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7-time course winner; creditable 2nd in C&D claimer when last seen; may need this
🔦 Spotlight: Seven-time course winner and dual C&D winner; won a 1m handicap here in November and bounced back from a lesser effort when beaten half a length in a C&D claimer in December; not seen since so may need this and he has the widest draw but capable of having a say if fully tuned up.
