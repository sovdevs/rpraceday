💬 Comment: Found Lingfield too sharp after a break last month; still ran well and this track can help
🔦 Spotlight: Two 7f turf wins for Archie Watson last spring; found things happening too quickly for him at Lingfield two weeks ago on his handicap/AW debut but he was keeping on and this track may prove more suitable; one to consider.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two fine C&D runs in late 2024; bad draw over 5f latest; dangerous if getting an easy lead
🔦 Spotlight: Battled hard to win over C&D in November off 2lb lower (blinkered first time); runner-up on his next three starts but his form has dipped slightly on his last two runs (both in today's cheekpieces), albeit he ran creditably at Newcastle for a 7lb claimer and then had a poor draw last time; he's found himself in a race without a lot of pace and he's capable of a big run off this mark.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: No win since debut; close third at Kempton last time but was well positioned
🔦 Spotlight: Still to add to his debut win and although he ran well at Kempton (6f) last month, he was well placed in a steadily run affair; needs more to defy this mark.
