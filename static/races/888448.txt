💬 Comment: Should find this trip more suitable but still needs to find more against a couple of these
🔦 Spotlight: Three wins over 1m2f-2m on the AW last year (one here), but has failed to beat a rival in two starts since returning in January, albeit they were over totally inadequate trips (1m/8.6f); this should be much more suitable, but he still needs to find a bit more against a couple of these.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: First past the post the last twice; 9lb higher but most 📈 progressive; should stay this far
🔦 Spotlight: 4yo who has only had five starts and has finished first past the post the last twice, winning with plenty in hand at Newcastle (1m4f, Tapeta) five weeks ago; handicapper didn't miss him with a 9lb rise, but he is a most 📈 progressive type and shouldn't have a problem with the longer trip (half-brother to a 1m6f/16.5f Tapeta winner).
