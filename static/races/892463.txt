Horse quote: 2024-07-13 at Navan (10f): "Doctor Grace wasn't winning out of turn. She is rock-solid in that grade and always runs her race for you when she gets conditions right - Michael Halford, joint-trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D winner off 2lb higher, ran well behind a few of these latest, yard in form, go well
🔦 Spotlight: Second runner for yard; C&D winner off 47 in February 2024; has shaped with promise on two of last three starts, including when staying on from the back for fifth behind a few of these on latest; dropped 1lb for that and is now 2lb below his last win; interesting.

💬 Comment: 0-6 on AW, third over 1m4f off 65 in January, 5lb lower but hard to fancy on recent runs
🔦 Spotlight: Turf claimer winner is 0-6 on the AW; best effort on this surface a 1.75l third of 11 on second start for this yard over 1m4f in a first-time hood; 5lb lower now but the headgear hasn't worked since and she finished well-beaten in a 7f claimer here on latest.
Horse quote: 2023-08-31 at Navan (8f): "Nika Pika had a good run at the Curragh but she just got stuck in holding ground at Galway. She got the mile well but there was no question about her stamina. We could look at a nursery now - Pat Magee, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 6-27 on the AW, C&D winner shaped well at Gowran latest, can't dismiss; reserve
🔦 Spotlight: First reserve; 6-27 on the AW with four wins coming here when trained by John McConnell, including one over C&D; shaped well on latest at Gowran (1m, yielding), slowly away and staying on for a 2.25l fourth; well-treated on old form and can't discount if getting a run.
