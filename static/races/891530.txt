🔦 Spotlight: Both AW wins this year at 1m, going back up 8lb for a wide-margin success at Wolverhampton last week; with just one turf win from 20 attempts, he has something to prove returned to 7f back on grass.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Suited by Catterick; second 7f win there on comeback this month; now 10lb higher
🔦 Spotlight: Turf runs mainly at Catterick and all her best handicap form is on that track, gaining her second 7f win there when making all (good) this month; needs to show she can repeat it elsewhere off 10lb higher.
Horse quote: 2024-07-10 at Catterick (7f): "Miss Willows loves a bit of cut in the ground. She didn't have a lot of luck in running the last time she ran and I told Ben [Sanderson, jockey] today to just sit where you're happy - Simon Whitaker, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Had some poor results towards the end of 2024 but 8lb lower than 7f win last July
🔦 Spotlight: Not much in it as to whether he's better at 7f or 1m but he won quite readily over this trip at Haydock (good) last July; went off the boil later but he's 8lb below that winning mark and his 6f return was mildly encouraging; more interesting than most.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 0-2 on turf; right out of sorts on AW around Christmas but better latest; hood discarded
🔦 Spotlight: Sole win at 7f on AW as 2yo; just two runs on turf, running respectably in a 6f Newmarket handicap on reappearance in 2024; had some serious down days around Christmas but back in better form at Wolverhampton in February; hooded last three starts but not today; unconvincing overall.

🔦 Spotlight: Suited by about 7f on stiff tracks, getting off the mark at Leicester (good to soft) last July and another win soon followed, at Beverley (good to firm) in August; just 1lb higher for the latter win and should come on for her recent comeback; can run well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggles these day and although better on AW last week he needs more back on turf
🔦 Spotlight: Two 7f wins for Charles Hills in 2023 but has struggled since; fared better on Chelmsford AW (7f) last week, following a fourth wind surgery, without doing enough to look on him as a likely winner here.
Horse quote: 2023-04-20 at Newmarket (7f): "I think that was the ride of the meeting. Harry Magnus was drawn one at Goodwood first time out and he jumped right away from the field and he was then in no man's land. Seven furlongs suits him well but he has got a bit of speed. We could drop him back in trip as he might get quicker. He has been a bit green learning his job and he is not fully there yet - Charles Hills, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won over 7f last June; mixed since and didn't run well on reappearance this month
🔦 Spotlight: Landed a 7f classified event at Ayr (good to firm) last June; mixed since and he didn't run well enough on his reappearance at Newcastle, where he's won in the past, to think he's going to play a part today.

💬 Comment: Has 1m form on turf; raced on AW since last July; possible reviver back on grass
🔦 Spotlight: Close up over 1m on turf last year for previous yard; has been racing on the AW since last July, not very fruitfully, but might see better from her back on turf if 7f doesn't prove on the sharp side.

🔦 Spotlight: Four 7f wins earlier in career but latest three successes over 6f in 2024; little to show for a handful of starts for this yard but he's taken a healthy drop in the weights and is one to watch for signs of a revival.
