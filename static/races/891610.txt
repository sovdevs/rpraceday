🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Strong chance on his Brocklesby form provided he can overcome a low draw
🔦 Spotlight: Showed plenty of speed in the Brocklesby (5f, good to soft) before narrowly outpointed by the Hannon-trained favourite; a few in behind at Doncaster have run well since but he has to overcome a low draw.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Highly encouraging debut last week but being drawn on the wing is not ideal
🔦 Spotlight: Half-brother to two winning sprinters and his dam was quick; took a while for the penny to drop last week at Leicester (5f, good) but nothing finished stronger; needs considering, for all that being drawn on the wing is anything but ideal.
