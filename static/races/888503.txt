🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Often flattered to deceive in past but shaped quite well on stable debut; interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Often flattered to deceive for Henry Candy but he has fallen in the weights and shaped quite well when third of nine over 6f at Southwell on stable debut; led briefly over 1f out that day and could be well suited by this drop back in distance; interesting.
