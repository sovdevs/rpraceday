🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Justified favouritism at Kempton (7f) latest and he's only 2lb higher here; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Generally reliable 4yo who got back on the scoresheet when justifying favouritism at Kempton (7f, Polytrack) 17 days ago; that was a narrow success but he's only 2lb higher here and is a 🔥 big player again if he gets a good pace to aim at.
