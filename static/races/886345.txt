🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Already ✂️ gelded and wears hood on debut but market support should be heeded
🔦 Spotlight: Dark Angel half-brother to 7f 2yo winner Courageous Knight (RPR 94); dam French 1m1f winner (92), half-sister to 1m 2yo Group 1 winner Ibn Khaldun, out of Fillies' Mile/Irish 1,000 Guineas winner; already ✂️ gelded and wears hood on debut, so perhaps isn't straightforward; however, represents very powerful stable and market support should be heeded.
