💬 Comment: Ask gelding, dam a sister to a 2m3f-2m5f winner, probably best watched on debut
🔦 Spotlight: Ask gelding is a first foal; dam pulled up in bumper and point, sister to 2m3f-2m5f hurdle/chase winner Tales Of The Tweed, out of unraced half-sister to 7f Flat/2m hurdle winner Bula Rose; this looks a suitable trip for debut and yard had a winner at Dundalk recently but probably best watched.
