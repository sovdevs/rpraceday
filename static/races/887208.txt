🔦 Spotlight: Didn't jump all that well when a short-head winner over C&D (good to soft; has won on soft and heavy) in December and found no fluency over his fences at Haydock next time; second of five at Chepstow (extended 2m3f, soft) puts him back into calculations even if he's not the most fluent jumper.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced 7yo who should be open to more improvement if all's well on this return
🔦 Spotlight: Chasing on last five starts, runner-up twice before he won over C&D (good to soft) and in clearcut fashion at Ayr (2m, soft); that was all last season and he's been raised another 4lb but this lightly raced 7yo should be open to more improvement if all's well on this return.
