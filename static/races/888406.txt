🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lots of good Flat runs in 2024; held over hurdles since but this more suitable; yard run 2
🔦 Spotlight: Series of good Flat runs last year, winning twice at Musselburgh and ending the season with two runner-up finishes at the same track; well held in two hurdle runs since but should be more comfortable back in this sphere; one of two runners for the stable.
