🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Bounced back with smooth win at Wolverhampton (9.4f) and he's respected at this new trip
🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from first 23 starts but he doubled his tally when bouncing back to score at Wolverhampton (9.4f, Tapeta) three weeks ago; this is tougher off 4lb higher but that was a smooth success and he could have more to offer at this new trip; possibilities.
