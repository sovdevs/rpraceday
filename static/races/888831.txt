🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won with a bit to spare at Punchestown, big chance from only 2lb out of the handicap
🔦 Spotlight: Dual-purpose; versatile sort has won on the Flat, over hurdles and twice over fences; built on the experience of her first two handicaps when scoring quite snugly at Punchestown; 5lb rise has left her only 2lb out of the handicap, and Conor Stone-Walsh's claim is a positive.

💬 Comment: Good form in beginners' chases, thrown in at the deep end in the Thyestes, can feature now
🔦 Spotlight: Won a 3m beginners' at Punchestown on New Year's Eve after a fine second behind Dancing City at the same venue; 9-1 when thrown in at the deep end for handicap debut in the Thyestes, made a mistake at the ninth when racing prominently and another four out, pulled up before the next; interesting here with 5lb claimed in this less demanding company.
