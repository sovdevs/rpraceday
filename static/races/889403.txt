🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Not progressing as hoped but still has strong form claims in a race of this nature
🔦 Spotlight: Point/bumper winner; three runs over hurdles include an odds-on defeat and a fall (running well), and he was no match for the winner in a 3m Hereford maiden last month; not progressing as hoped but still has strong form claims in a race of this nature; the drop in trip could be favourable.
