🔦 Spotlight: After three successive seconds she was rewarded for her consistency at Newcastle (1m, AW) last month, when she broke her duck in a fillies' maiden; has gone close here (1m, good to soft); initial mark looks on the stiff side but she is open to improvement and much respected back down in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 7f AW winner; went close over a stiff 6f (good) latest; can improve; likely player.
🔦 Spotlight: Odds-on both starts, winning at Newcastle (7f, AW) in January and only just held when racing prominently at Ponterfract (6f, good) last month; can continue to improve back over this trip on this flatter track; likely player on handicap debut.
Horse quote: 2025-01-14 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "She wasn't doing a lot in front. Obviously, it's her first start and she's still very green, but She's The Duchess has got a great attitude and did things nicely. There's a lot more filling out for her to do. She still rides a little bit weak, so with a little bit more time, I'd imagine that she can progress - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
