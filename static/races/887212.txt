💬 Comment: 15-2 from 16-1, stuck on well when fifth of 14 in maiden at Chepstow (extended 2m3f, soft)
🔦 Spotlight: Second foal; dam runner-up in a point, out of bumper winner; 15-2 from 16-1 for maiden hurdle at Chepstow (extended 2m3f, soft) and although he was fighting a losing cause from a long way out, he stuck on well to be about 8l fifth of 14; should improve, which is needed.
