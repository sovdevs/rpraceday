🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Improved form on final 2yo start, winning 1m2f event on soft ground at Newmarket
🔦 Spotlight: Possible stayer in the making as he's half-brother to a 1m6f/2m winner and ended last season with a 1m2f success on soft going at Newmarket, improving for the switch to a stiffer test; likely player on that form but drying ground would count against him.
