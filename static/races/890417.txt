🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Giant strides in 2024, winning Portland off 2lb lower; C&D win first time out last year
🔦 Spotlight: One of the success stories of the 2024 season, winning three handicaps, including over C&D and the valuable Portland at the Doncaster St Leger meeting; 11-4 favourite for the Ayr Gold Cup when last seen but raced freely and didn't get home; remains capable of better over 5f, won first time out last year and is just 2lb higher than for the Doncaster win; chance.
Horse quote: 2024-09-14 at Doncaster (5.5f): "American Affair has done nothing but improve all year. Jim Goldie is some trainer. The last couple of races he's been running with the choke out and not really finishing. Jim said today to ride him ice cold, I got him to switch off and he finished really well. What will he be like next year with another winter on his back? He's still very babyish and raw - Paul Mulrennan, jockey."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returns to handicaps off a manageable mark; conditions should suit; strong claims
🔦 Spotlight: Made his name for the Gosdens on AW but he's fine on turf too and ran well in all three turf starts at Meydan for his new stable (flopped on dirt in February); 5lb higher than when winning at Doncaster last October but conditions should suit and he's a 🔥 big player.
Horse quote: 2024-12-20 at Meydan (5f): "Cover Up likes a fast pace and he got that today; he picked up all the way. I thought it was a good race; Bilhayl and Ponntos set a high standard, so he had to improve, which he did - William Buick, jockey."

🔦 Spotlight: Won from American Affair at Haydock last summer (5f, good) and ended 2024 by chasing home Cover Up at Doncaster (5f, soft); weighted to beat both of those rivals today and connections won this race in 2022; capable of another prominent showing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Well backed when capitalising on his reduced mark over C&D 17 days ago; respected up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Quiet winter on AW but, having dropped 10lb in the weights, he rewarded market support with a ready C&D win 17 days ago; this time he has 5lb rise, stronger opposition and other pace to contend with but still likely to go well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: York win last summer was quality sprint form; career best is needed to win this on return
🔦 Spotlight: Promising return to action over C&D last April and showed what he was capable of when beating his 21 rivals at York's Ebor meeting (5.5f, good to firm); close third behind American Affair in the Portland and ran okay at Ascot when last seen; could progress further this year but he'll need to.
Horse quote: 2024-08-21 at York (5.5f): "When the draw came out and the ground was dry we were delighted. This was the plan all along, but Jm Jungle will roll away in all the big five-furlong handicap sprints for the rest of the year - John Quinn, joint-trainer."

💬 Comment: Two 5f wins last year, notably at Glorious Goodwood; needs a career best but it's possible
🔦 Spotlight: Speedy sort who won twice last year, notably at Glorious Goodwood (5f, good); absent since a good fourth off this mark at Southwell 233 days ago; career best required but that's not out of the question.
Horse quote: 2023-06-03 at Epsom (5f): "We thought Tatterstall had a nice chance. He hung when winning on his first run at Wolverhampton, and then at York he was only beaten about two and three-quarter lengths. This was the obvious race to come for, he likes the ground and Connor said he battled back - Chloe Dods, trainer's daughter."

🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in this race in 2023; came good last autumn on slow ground, winning 5f handicaps at Chester and Catterick; well behind Cover Up on final run in 2024 and he'll need to leave his recent AW reappearance behind him.
Horse quote: 2024-10-19 at Catterick (5f): "It was a bit easier this year [than last year]. Vintage Clarets' last couple of runs were good, he enjoys that ground, he broke well and I was able to get the run of the race - Osin Orr, rider."
