🔦 Spotlight: Down the field at Newmarket on debut but he ran to a useful level in two Polytrack runs in the autumn, doing best of those held up when a beaten favourite at Chelmsford 165 days ago; solid claims back from a break.

🔦 Spotlight: Promise on debut and confirmed that when second of 17 at Redcar in September (6f, good to firm), travelling powerfully and not helped by the winner carrying him left in the closing stages; failed to build on that in two runs on soft ground subsequently (stiff task on former occasion), after which he was ✂️ gelded; interesting back on faster ground.

🔦 Spotlight: Three runs at Southwell this winter, improving run by run and catching the eye of the stewards eight weeks ago (7f) when given a considerate ride in the closing stages (rider reported her to be green and rolling around in the straight); drop back in trip shouldn't be a problem but improvement is required if she's to trouble the principals on her turf debut.

💰L1 Odds: 200.0 ❄️❄️
📝L1 Comment: pressed leader, 🎯 led after 1f, ran green under 3f out, soon headed, challenging from 2f out, ❄️ weakened gradually from over 1f out (inquiry into running and riding; jockey stated that he was given no specific instructions other than to ride filly as he found her and to obtain best possible placing; he explained that filly had raced green, a fact he had reported at scales; he added that having jumped well he was able to make the running until turning into home straight when filly appeared to take an awkward stride and became unbalanced as a result;  he further added that filly continued to race green in home straight by rolling around under pressure and he felt it not necessary to resort to the use of the whip and to keep his hands on reins in order to keep his mount straight; he concluded by adding filly had ❄️ weakened in latter stages and he had recommended a drop back in trip and to be ridden with more cover in the future; trainer's rep confirmed that there were no specific instructions as jockey had ridden filly in both her races and work at home; their explanations were noted)
