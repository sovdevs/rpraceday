💬 Comment: Still headstrong but made most and hung on well for a close C&D third to Flamborough Head
🔦 Spotlight: Headstrong sort even when hooded on seasonal/handicap debut over C&D (good) two weeks ago but he made most and hung on well for a close third of 11 to Flamborough Head; has an unchanged mark and place claims again but that failure to settle is offputting.

🔦 Spotlight: 0-7 in Ireland last year; best form gives him a shot at this, however, and there was an echo of that when fourth of 11 to Flamborough Head over C&D (16-1; prominent long way) on seasonal debut for new connections; considered.

🔦 Spotlight: He did not beat many in his three qualifying runs over 7f/1m on AW last November/December but there was some late headway when tongue tied last time; ✂️ gelded since; cheekpieces are also now enlisted for this seasonal/handicap debut and he needs a 📊 market check.

🔦 Spotlight: Late foal who ran over 6f twice last autumn, on good to soft/soft; ✂️ gelded before finishing markedly closer on reappearance at Southwell (5f, AW) 13 days ago, when always behind but it's not hard to think that being moved up to 1m for handicap debut will make him a more potent force.

💬 Comment: Won by a head from off pace at Southwell (upped to 1m, AW) 13 days ago, front two clear
🔦 Spotlight: Improved when second at Newcastle (7f, AW) last month and did so again to win by a head from off the pace in ten-runner race at Southwell (upped to 1m, AW) 13 days ago; the front two drew clear last time and she's far from ruled out by 5lb rise if proving as effective back on turf.
