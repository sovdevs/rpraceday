💬 Comment: Promise in maidens, well-bred, opening mark looks fair, of obvious interest upped in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Well-bred filly showed mild promise on good and heavy ground in two of three maiden runs for top yard; opening mark looks fair; of obvious interest stepping up in distance on handicap debut.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Off the mark at Navan, hiked up 8lb, has struggled on soft previously, needs rain to miss
🔦 Spotlight: Best maiden effort came on decent ground; won on his seasonal return in his first turf handicap at Navan (1m2f, good) eleven days ago; hiked up 8lb; should stay this far on that evidence but he struggled in maidens on soft-heavy; probably needs the rain to miss.

🔦 Spotlight: Is 0-4 on turf; big step forward on seasonal return and handicap debut at Leopardstown (1m2f, good) last month; up 3lb and will likely encounter very different ground here; half-brother won on soft so could handle it; chance upped in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won two claimers last year, handles heavy, 🆕 new yard, handicap debut, check market
🔦 Spotlight: Won claimers at Naas (1m, good) and Dundalk (7f) last season for Ger Lyons; went close in a heavy ground maiden at Roscommon so won't mind the forecast rain; 🆕 new yard now and upped in trip for handicap debut; lacks a run but worth a 📊 market check.
Horse quote: 2024-09-19 at Naas (8f): "William F Browne is a lovely horse and is going the right way. We had no option really but to come here as he needs every yard of the trip - Ger Lyons, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Didn't show much in a trio of maidens last year including on soft-heavy; better effort on seasonal return and handicap debut at Leopardstown (1m2f, good); Foley now takes over but soft or heavy ground would be a major worry.
