üí¨ Comment: Behind My Drogo at Haydock where a late mistake didn't cost him the race
üî¶ Spotlight: Did well in handicaps last season; it was a winnable hunter chase in which he justified favouritism in February and a fortnight later he came up short behind My Drogo at Haydock, where a late mistake didn't cost him the race; looks vulnerable.
