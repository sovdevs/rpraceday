🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 4yo who still has potential and could resume his progress on this step up to 2m; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced 4yo who justified favouritism in a Wolverhampton handicap (9.4f) in February; has not gone on from that in two runs since (1m2f/1m4f) but he has stamina on his dam's side and could resume his progress on this switch to a staying trip; respected with cheekpieces added.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Struggled in final two runs last year and has something to prove on return; had wind op
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time turf winner at up to 2m on good or slower ground; his last success was off this mark at Ayr (1m7f) in October but he struggled in his final two runs last season; had wind surgery since but he has something to prove back on AW after 177 days off; stablemate of Billy Bathgate.
Horse quote: 2020-09-10 at Navan (10f): "Ebony Maw did that lovely. He's still green, he dosn't have many miles on the clock, and he wouldn't want the ground any better than yielding. There could be a nice handicap in him over 1m2f plus - Shane Lyons, assistant trainer"

🔦 Spotlight: Just one win from 41 starts but he's well treated on plenty of placed form on Tapeta last year and he didn't get any luck at Wolverhampton (1m4f) last month; seems pretty versatile trip-wise and has possibilities on this step back up to 2m.
