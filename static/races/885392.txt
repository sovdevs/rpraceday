🔦 Spotlight: Maiden and novice winner who showed her best form when front-running second at Warwick (2m5f, good to soft) in November on handicap debut; she followed that, however, with last of seven at Doncaster (2m3f) 15 days ago; new trip is plausible.

🔦 Spotlight: 12yo who is 5-36 over hurdles, the latest win at Wincanton (3m, soft) last March off 2lb lower; needs much better than she's delivered last two starts, a start to the campaign which contrasts starkly with last term but her trainer has had recent winners.

🔦 Spotlight: Best efforts under rules when front-running; dual winning pointer in 2022 and, after a break, she also won late that year on soft in her first two hurdle races; second on handicap debut here (near 2m4f, soft) in March 2023 but pulled up at Auteuil that April and soundly beaten on chase debut that November; fitness is a big question but she'd be interesting if returning on song.
