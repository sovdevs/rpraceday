🔦 Spotlight: Maiden and novice winner who showed her best form when front-running second at Warwick (2m5f, good to soft) in November on handicap debut; she followed that, however, with last of seven at Doncaster (2m3f) 15 days ago; new trip is plausible.

🔦 Spotlight: 12yo who is 5-36 over hurdles, the latest win at Wincanton (3m, soft) last March off 2lb lower; needs much better than she's delivered last two starts, a start to the campaign which contrasts starkly with last term but her trainer has had recent winners.
