🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won last March; in marked contrast to last term, she's started this season out of form
🔦 Spotlight: 12yo who is 5-36 over hurdles, the latest win at Wincanton (3m, soft) last March off 2lb lower; needs much better than she's delivered last two starts, a start to the campaign which contrasts starkly with last term but her trainer has had recent winners.
