🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point winner who has been runner-up on both hurdle starts and holds strong claims
🔦 Spotlight: Irish mares' maiden point winner (3m, soft to heavy) who has finished second on both hurdle starts (2m6f/2m7f, heavy/good to soft), most recently beaten just a neck at Bangor; has shaped as though she may benefit from this drop back in trip for the time being; strong claims.

📝 Comment: 🔄 towards rear, headway 2 out, ran on run-in, nearest finish (jockey said, regarding running and riding, that his instructions were to get covered up behind runners and settled as gelding ran too free before falling in his previous start; adding that gelding made a respiratory noise in back straight, a fact which he reported at scales, he further added that his recommendation to the trainer was for gelding to step up in trip for future runs)

💬 Comment: Well beaten on rules debut but may have needed it; the form of his point win reads well
🔦 Spotlight: Weakened into well-beaten fourth on last month's rules debut in a maiden hurdle here (2m1f, good to soft); however, he was returning from a long absence and the form of his Irish maiden point win (3m, soft) in November 2023 reads well; no surprise if he's a serious force today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two British point wins but well beaten on rules debut and may be one for further down line
🔦 Spotlight: Won two British points (2m, good to soft) early last year; may win races under rules but he was a well-beaten third of six at Leicester last month (2m4f, heavy; 28-1) and could be one for further down the line.

💬 Comment: Well beaten on rules debut but may have needed it; the form of his point win reads well
🔦 Spotlight: Weakened into well-beaten fourth on last month's rules debut in a maiden hurdle here (2m1f, good to soft); however, he was returning from a long absence and the form of his Irish maiden point win (3m, soft) in November 2023 reads well; no surprise if he's a serious force today.

🔦 Spotlight: Weakened into well-beaten fourth on last month's rules debut in a maiden hurdle here (2m1f, good to soft); however, he was returning from a long absence and the form of his Irish maiden point win (3m, soft) in November 2023 reads well; no surprise if he's a serious force today.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Point runner-up who may have needed last month's hurdle debut; each-way possible
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up in Irish maiden point (3m, good to yielding) in May 2023 and kept on for fair third in Bangor bumper (2m, soft) that October; after missing all of last year he was a soundly beaten sixth over C&D (good to soft) last month but may have needed the run; each-way possible.

🔦 Spotlight: Won two British points (2m, good to soft) early last year; may win races under rules but he was a well-beaten third of six at Leicester last month (2m4f, heavy; 28-1) and could be one for further down the line.
