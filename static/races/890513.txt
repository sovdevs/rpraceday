🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Returned to form with clear second at Ffos Las on Sunday; back up in trip today
🔦 Spotlight: Won twice over 3m last spring (soft/good) and ended string of disappointing performances when clear runner-up at Ffos Las (2m3f, good to soft) on Sunday; it's hard to predict whether he'll be in the right mood again here but the move back up in trip will suit and he's still well handicapped (even from 2lb out of the weights).
Horse quote: 2018-04-23 at Newton Abbot (17f): "Higgs is still learning and should improve again. I did not think he might handle this sticky ground, but he has done well and we will keep him going for another run or two before he has a summer break - Sarah-Jayne Davies, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made significant jumping errors in both chases; can be dangerous if more fluent
🔦 Spotlight: Good-ground hurdle winner for another stable last spring; made significant jumping errors in both chases this year but kept on well for fourth of 14 at Taunton (2m7f, good to soft) on first occasion and could be dangerous here if he finds some fluency.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won at Worcester last summer but returned from break with two lesser efforts in winter
🔦 Spotlight: Won at Worcester (2m4f, good) last summer, his second run after returning to racing under rules, but came back from break with two disappointing runs during the winter (hurdle/chase) and arrives here with a bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2021-10-17 at Cork (24f): "Sweet Street is an honest homebred owned by my father-in-law (John Motherway). She's probably improving a little every day. It was a pity that she didn't get black type last time but we might have another shot at it somewhere. She's versatile in terms of ground but I'd say she needs a trip, that seems to be her secret. Hopefully we'll have more fun with her. She has the option of going to Down Royal for a Grade 3 mares' novice hurdle or coming back here against the geldings in a fortnight. We'll see closer to the time - Roger McGrath, trainer"
