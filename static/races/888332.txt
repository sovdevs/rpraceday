💬 Comment: Up another 6lb but lightly raced and has more to offer after clearcut win over C&D
🔦 Spotlight: Won over 2m4f here (good to soft) in December on handicap debut; pulled up with a respiratory noise on soft next time but returned from wind surgery for a clearcut win over C&D (good to soft; first-time tongue-tie) last month; ridden by Conner McCann for those three starts; up another 6lb but lightly raced and has more to offer.

💬 Comment: Staying-on second over an extended 2m6f at Kelso (soft) three starts ago; fell last time
🔦 Spotlight: Faded at Ayr in January on first crack at 3m and fell three out when having another go at it on latest outing; however, he had looked a good prospect for this sort of trip when staying on for second over an extended 2m6f at Kelso (soft) three starts ago and could still tap back into that promise.

💬 Comment: Rather stole the race at Catterick in December; good second there on latest start
🔦 Spotlight: Two good runs late last year, winning over 3m1f at Catterick on second occasion (good ground; set up clear lead and rather stole the race); has remained at Catterick since, good second when held up over 2m3f on latest start but this race is probably a bit too warm.

💬 Comment: Pipped here two runs ago; 4lb out of the handicap, so probably not about to break his duck
🔦 Spotlight: Narrowly denied after a final-flight error over C&D (good to soft) on penultimate start, just in front of Anamanda; not so good behind Uokhun at Hexham last week, however, and now 4lb out of the handicap, so this probably isn't when he finally breaks his duck.
