💬 Comment: Cosy Yarmouth winner on stable debut; 6lb rise does not look insurmountable
🔦 Spotlight: All wins have come at 6f on sound surface; posted personal best on stable debut three weeks ago, quickening well to score in clearcut fashion at Yarmouth; may still be 🔍 unexposed and 6lb rise does not look insurmountable.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Pleasing start for 🆕 new yard when sixth at Thirsk; drop back in trip is a plus; big chance
🔦 Spotlight: 📈 progressive for Charlie Fellowes last year, winning twice, and made an encouraging reappearance when sixth of 13 at Thirsk (7f, good; raced freely, lost three places inside final 1f) two weeks ago; dropping back in distance looks a sensible move and he still has untapped potential; big chance.

💬 Comment: 6-9 in hood; shaped well when fourth last time; 🔥 big player returned to sprint distances
🔦 Spotlight: Has a record of 6-9 since wearing a hood; the wins have come on the AW but he showed he's just as effective on turf with creditable fourth of eight at Musselburgh two weeks ago; 7f might have stretched his stamina that day and he's a 🔥 big player returned to sprint distances.

🔦 Spotlight: Front-runner who scored three times in 2024; all those wins came over 7f but he seems just as effective at 6f and he has a good record here; shaped well over an inadequate 5f at Beverley on reappearance and that run should have blown away the cobwebs; not fully exposed and should go well.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Yarmouth winner last autumn and might have needed reappearance; not ruled out
🔦 Spotlight: Not as good as he was but he still won at Yarmouth (6f, good to firm; eyeshields first time) last autumn; might have needed the run at Newmarket on reappearance; encounters optimum conditions here and not ruled out.
Horse quote: 2021-06-12 at York (6f): "I'm thrilled, this has been the plan since First Folio won at Yarmouth very impressively, with Newmarket on the way. The faster ground definitely helped him out today and we made sure we got him out of the stalls. Credit to Dan, he gave him a very cool ride - James Ferguson, trainer.  This horse probably lacked a bit of experience in a big field last time and I wasn't disappointed with the way he went through the race - his finishing position didn't reflect how well he ran - Daniel Muscutt, jockey."

💬 Comment: Three wins last autumn; only tenth of 13 at Thirsk on return and may again be vulnerable
🔦 Spotlight: Revitalised when returned to 7f+ last autumn, winning three times including here; however, he was only tenth of 13 at Thirsk (16-1) on reappearance and may again be vulnerable off the same mark.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Doncaster (7f): "It Just Takes Time made it look easy and relished the ground. It slowed the others down but he's a very simple ride. I popped him out and drop the hands and that's his style. He hits a flat spot but never gives up. He's very game - Olivia Tubb, jockey."
