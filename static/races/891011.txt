🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Two solid runs in 2m4f chases and stepping up to 3m can benefit now handicapping
🔦 Spotlight: Lightly raced maiden hurdle winner who also won a point; not beaten far in her first two runs over fences and stepping up to 3m from 2m4f should benefit, and help her jumping; likely 🚀 improver.

💬 Comment: Gave it a good go from the front in a 2m6f handicap chase at Punchestown
🔦 Spotlight: Strike-rate of 1-10 over both hurdles and fences; gave it a good go from the front in a 2m6f handicap chase at Punchestown last time (heavy) and the recent rain has done her prospects no harm; considered.

🔦 Spotlight: Beat The Wallpark for his maiden hurdle win and added a handicap chase at Kilbeggan last August (3m1f); probably true that he now needs further than the 2m4f he ran over last time and Patrick O'Brien takes off 7lb.
