🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Course winner; easy 7f success at Lingfield on Monday; 0-15 at 6f but still a key player
🔦 Spotlight: Back to winning ways in a low-grade 7f handicap here on Boxing Day; held his form since, bar one blip tried in headgear, and he turned in his best effort for some time when running away with a 7f handicap at Lingfield on Monday; 4lb penalty to deal with but in a lower grade; leading form claims but he is 0-15 at this trip.
