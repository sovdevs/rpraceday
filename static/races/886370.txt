🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Began career with two course wins (7f/1m); commands respect on handicap debut
🔦 Spotlight: Won 7f novice here on debut in November 2023 and, following a 13-month absence, quickened best to justify odds-on favouritism in tactical C&D novice in December; makes his handicap debut today and the limit of his ability remains very hard to gauge.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made all for wide-margin C&D maiden win on Tapeta debut in December; respected
🔦 Spotlight: Placed on three of his five turf starts last year and was evidently well suited by the switch to Tapeta when making all to win a C&D maiden by over 7l in December; tackles much stronger opposition today but could still have untapped potential on this surface.
