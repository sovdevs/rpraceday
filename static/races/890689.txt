💬 Comment: 7lb higher than when winning easily over C&D last time, but should still be hard to beat
🔦 Spotlight: Winless in his first 15 starts, but was showing improved form prior to winning by nearly 5l over C&D 12 days ago; raised 7lb for that but should still be hard to beat in his bid for a follow-up.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five wins around here including over this trip last time; only 2lb higher; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins around here including when stepped up to this trip for the first time in a steadily run event last month; still has stamina to prove in a truly run race over this far, but he is only 2lb higher so has to make the shortlist.
Horse quote: 2025-03-31 at Wolverhampton (AW) (14f): "There was no real pace on paper beforehand. I wasn't going quick where I was but if I'd been going any quicker I'd have taken Moon Over The Sea out of his comfort zone. He's seen the trip out well - Jason Watson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🔦 Spotlight: Did well over 16.5f on Tapeta after November, finishing first past the post in four of his five starts here and at Southwell; hasn't run very well in his last two outings elsewhere, though, and hopes pinned on the return here rekindling the fire.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Unplaced in eight starts on AW and last four efforts on artificial surfaces have been poor
🔦 Spotlight: Won three times on turf last year and also twice over hurdles in November; unplaced in eight starts on the AW, though, and last four efforts on artificial surfaces have been poor; look elsewhere.
Horse quote: 2024-11-12 at Huntingdon (20.5f): "Laser Focus is in at Southwell on Friday and we might have to go again as he's won so easily. He's a good ground horse so it makes sense - James Owen trainer."
