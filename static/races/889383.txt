🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Irish point 2nd worked out well; good bumper debut for 🆕 new yard; strong contender
🔦 Spotlight: Smart Irish point form when chasing home one who's now on a mark of 130, with promising subsequent winners behind; his Sandown bumper debut (heavy) for this yard in February was a useful effort too and he's a strong contender for yard with a good strike-rate in bumpers (9-35).

💬 Comment: Showed promise in bumpers at Newbury and Huntingdon; place prospects
🔦 Spotlight: Two promising efforts in bumpers, having a stiff task behind a high-class winner at Newbury (good) and bumping into an above-average Skelton newcomer at Huntingdon (good to soft); one of the more likely ones.
