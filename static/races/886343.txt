🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Could well reverse last-time C&D placings with Arctician, as Kyle McHugh takes off 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Only 1-13 on AW but he's in a consistent vein of form this winter and went down by only a short head to Arctician over C&D most recently; good chance with Kyle McHugh taking off 5lb.
