🔦 Spotlight: 12 chase wins, the latest when battling on well to lead close home at Musselburgh (2m7f, good to soft) three weeks ago; not very reliable nowadays but is only 2lb higher here and this track also suits him.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has been in the doldrums but combination of ease in grade and new tongue-tie offers hope
🔦 Spotlight: Out of form last season and has also disappointed on both outings this term but drops in grade today and might be aided by new tongue-tie (reportedly made respiratory noise last time); dangerous to ignore.
