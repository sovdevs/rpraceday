🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 3-4 over C&D this year, including making all last week; up in grade but can't rule out
🔦 Spotlight: Thriving this year, winning three of his last four starts (all over C&D) and only finding a well-handicapped rival too strong on the other occasion; made all last week and could enjoy the run of the race again; this does represent a stiffer assignment though.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: On a handy mark and his record after a break heightens interest; capable of a big run
🔦 Spotlight: Has often run well after a break and he is now 3lb lower than for his Doncaster win last June; wouldn't be ideally suited by a tactical event but he's capable of a prominent showing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: C&D win in November was followed by a good effort in Listed company; still low mileage
🔦 Spotlight: Well backed when landing a C&D fillies' handicap in November off a 4lb lower mark; respectable effort in a Deauville Listed event in December and she is clearly well suited by synthetics; still low mileage but another personal best is required back against male opposition.
