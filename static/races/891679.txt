🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Won very comfortably on last month's British debut at Wincanton and makes obvious appeal
🔦 Spotlight: Runner-up on debut in France last summer and won very comfortably when reappearing for Paul Nicholls at Wincanton (1m7f, good; first-time hood) last month; could easily have a lot more to offer and makes obvious appeal.
Horse quote: 2025-03-24 at Wincanton (15f): "Zaochen Enki came over from France just before Christmas very light and lean and we didn't think we'd get a run into him this season as it also took a while to get him to settle down and relax. This his will have done him an awful lot of good and he'll remain a novice until December 1st - Paul Nicholls, trainer, talking to Racing TV."

🔦 Spotlight: 2-7 over hurdles; has hefty 12lb penalty to shoulder here but returned from break with good second in Exeter handicap (2m, good) this month and ought to play a significant role.
Horse quote: 2024-11-18 at Exeter (16.5f): "Inside Man can be a bit busy and needs to learn to settle, switch off and come with a run, which he did here. He's a Manatee and they tend to want soft ground. He's a chaser in the long term - Jane Williams, trainer, talking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Caused 40-1 surprise on hurdle debut at Warwick and goes on the shortlist here
🔦 Spotlight: Irish point winner who left his disappointing bumper debut a long way behind when causing 40-1 surprise in Warwick novice hurdle (2m, good; first-time hood) six weeks ago; that form is quite tricky to evaluate but, nevertheless, he goes on the shortlist here.
Horse quote: 2025-03-09 at Warwick (16f): "It wasn't really a surprise, to be honest. I rode Sage Green a few weeks ago at Chepstow and made the running that day, and he ran his race a little bit in the preliminaries and down at the start. I said I wouldn't be too despondent on the bare place he's finished, as he ran a nice race on bad ground. I was delighted they put a hood on him today and they said just change tactics, drop him in, and teach him how to race correctly. I didn't know turning in if we'd be good enough but he's done it quite nicely - James Best, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Ran okay in C&D junior hurdle on debut but safely held on next outing
🔦 Spotlight: Made fairly encouraging debut when third of six in C&D (heavy) junior hurdle in January, but was safely held on good ground at Taunton last month; others in this line-up look much stronger.

💬 Comment: Won Irish bumper in 2023 but has made a low-key start to his hurdling career
🔦 Spotlight: Comfortably won Rosocommon bumper on debut for Willie Mullins in summer 2023 but left that stable after rather underwhelming hurdle debut in September and did not get seriously competitive on his first two starts for Neil Mulholland.
