Horse quote: 2023-03-25 at Kelso (21f): "Les's Legacy was given a textbook ride by Dillan. That was tremendous, it's good when a plan works because quite often it doesn't. This has been the plan since the Go North series came out. I try to have something for each race and we thought Les's Legacy would be better over this two miles four than the two miles, although he qualified for both; Susan Corbett, trainer."

💬 Comment: Made it 2-4 at this track when justifying favouritism over C&D latest; respected up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Has mixed record in eight runs over hurdles but he got back on the scoresheet when justifying favouritism over C&D (good to soft) last month; up 5lb but he's now 2-4 at this track and that was a personal best last time; shortlisted.
Horse quote: 2024-12-11 at Hexham (20f): "I was really pleased with Forest Blaze as we've always thought he'd be a nice horse. We were very happy with his run over two miles last time as we expected the step up in trip to really suit. He's got a couple of entries in the next few days, but I'm not sure if he'll take them up as he's got the job done now - Mark Walford, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Made it 2-4 at this track when justifying favouritism over C&D latest; respected up 5lb
🔦 Spotlight: Has mixed record in eight runs over hurdles but he got back on the scoresheet when justifying favouritism over C&D (good to soft) last month; up 5lb but he's now 2-4 at this track and that was a personal best last time; shortlisted.

🔦 Spotlight: His last win was in December 2022 but he turned things around after wind surgery when runner-up behind Les's Legacy over C&D (good to soft) last month; that was off a much-reduced mark and he has possibilities if he can back that up.
Horse quote: 2022-05-07 at Haydock (24.5f): "Sue [Smith] has worked miracles with Romeo Brown - the things that she has done have been brilliant. He fell twice here over hurdles but his jumping was ironed out and all credit must go to all the team at Sue's. He's earned a rest now and chasing is on the cards - Richard Longley, owner."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Went close at Ayr in January but he's been well held since and is now 0-15 over hurdles
🔦 Spotlight: Went close off this mark at Ayr (2m5f, soft) in January but he's been disappointing in both runs since and is now 0-15 over hurdles; others are more convincing.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Lightly raced in recent years and has lots to prove after 328 days off
🔦 Spotlight: Ended a long losing run at Bangor (2m7f, good) in August 2023 but he's had only four runs since and finished ninth in his two starts last year; has lots to prove after 328 days off and he's in the veteran stage now.
Horse quote: 2019-09-06 at Kilbeggan (19.5f): "It's possible he could go for a winners' bumper. The owners (Mark Murray and Grant Harrison) are from the north of England, and he could go to Hexham in a couple of weeks - Gavin Cromwell, trainer"
