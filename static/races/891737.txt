🔦 Spotlight: Four-time hurdle winner who won a five-runner handicap chase at Fontwell off 13lb higher in September (2m3f, good to soft); mixed form since, including when tried over hurdles (beaten 39l at Huntingdon); bit to prove.
Horse quote: 2022-09-28 at Bangor-on-Dee (20.5f): "Midnight Jewel won at Fontwell last time even though he didn't seem to enjoy the track. He's quick at the obstacles and is so game - Lilly Pinchin, rider."
