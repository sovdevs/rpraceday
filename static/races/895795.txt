🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed in three of his five starts, this looks like a perfect opportunity to open account
🔦 Spotlight: Placed in three of his five starts; slightly concerning that his last two runs have failed to match a Dundalk third behind the useful Currawood; however, this looks like a perfect opportunity for the 76-rated gelding to open his account; blinkers used when fifth of 16 in a handicap last time are left off now.
