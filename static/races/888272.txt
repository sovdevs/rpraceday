🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed here four times in a row this season; different trip-and-ground combination today
🔦 Spotlight: Placed here four consecutive times this season, most recently when runner-up in first-time blinkers three weeks ago (2m5f, heavy); not certain to be suited by today's different trip-and-ground combination but still features prominently in calculations.

💬 Comment: Didn't fire last time but earlier Catterick second was a good effort; good ground suits
🔦 Spotlight: Did not fire at Uttoxeter last month and is now 0-5 over fences but his clear second at Catterick (3m1f, good to soft; first-time cheekpieces) two starts ago was a good effort and he'll be suited by the forecast good ground here.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Placed twice over 2m5f here this year but others in the line-up look stronger
🔦 Spotlight: Placed twice over 2m5f on heavy ground here this season and is effectively on a lower mark from only 1lb out of the handicap today, but others in the line-up look stronger all the same; seems okay on good ground but has stamina to prove over 3m2f.
