🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 260,000gns yearling; half-sister to nine winners; open to improvement under the penalty
🔦 Spotlight: 260,000gns yearling who's a half-sister to nine winners; started 4-7 when winning a weak-loooking 7f Tapeta maiden in January (albeit the clear runner-up since run well again) and is open to improvement under the penalty.
Horse quote: 2025-01-14 at Newcastle (AW) (7f): "She wasn't doing a lot in front. Obviously, it's her first start and she's still very green, but She's The Duchess has got a great attitude and did things nicely. There's a lot more filling out for her to do. She still rides a little bit weak, so with a little bit more time, I'd imagine that she can progress - Billy Loughnane, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."
