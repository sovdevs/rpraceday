🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five-time course winner; this is probably his best trip and he should go well
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time course winner including in a slowly run contest over 1m6f last month, but didn't get home when sixth of seven over the same distance here on Saturday; this is probably his best trip, though, and he may fare better if turning out again.
Horse quote: 2025-03-31 at Wolverhampton (AW) (14f): "There was no real pace on paper beforehand. I wasn't going quick where I was but if I'd been going any quicker I'd have taken Moon Over The Sea out of his comfort zone. He's seen the trip out well - Jason Watson, jockey, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Five wins here, four over this trip; may well get the true pace he needs; shortlisted
🔦 Spotlight: Five wins here, four over this trip the latest of which was in January; still in a feasible mark and may well get the true pace he needs; one for the shortlist.
Horse quote: 2021-03-13 at Wolverhampton (AW) (9.5f): "Starfighter has been a slow burner since he joined us from Ed Walker's and it's just taken a bit of time to get him right. He was rated higher a few years back so hopefully there's bit more improvement there and he'll go on the turf - Mark Loughnane, trainer."

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Prominent racer whose three wins have all come here; could go well if able to dominate
🔦 Spotlight: Prominent-racer whose three wins have all come here, the latest in a 0-50 classified event over this trip last month; didn't stay 1m6f back here a week later and should appreciate the return to this trip; could go well especially if able to dominate.
Horse quote: 2023-12-10 at Wolverhampton (AW) (9.5f): "I'm delighted with Prince Hector, he's taken a bit of getting to know but hopefully we can now keep his head in front - Jessica Bedi, trainer."

💬 Comment: 0-7; plenty to prove upped in trip on stable/Tapeta debut after eight months off
🔦 Spotlight: Second of 12 on her second start for Charlie Fellowes at Lingfield (1m2f, Polytrack) in November 2023, but showed nothing in five outings after reappearing a year ago; changed hands for 15,000gns in October and has plenty to prove upped in trip on stable/Tapeta debut after eight months off.
