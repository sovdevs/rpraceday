🔦 Spotlight: Not the best of jumpers and yet to win in four attempts over fences; spoilt chance with a bad error three out when second at Leicester last week (2m, good to soft; 6-5 favourite; cheekpieces tried); obvious contender.

🔦 Spotlight: In the frame in two of three points in Ireland; fair hurdles debut in slowly run affair at Uttoxeter in December (2m, soft), but ran out next time and was well beaten on latest start at Wetherby (2m3f, soft); chase/handicap debut.
