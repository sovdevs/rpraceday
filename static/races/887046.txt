🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Very much sets the standard; on paper, unraced stablemate Magical Treasure is interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Fair form when beaten 4l at Newmarket last September and again when no match for an impressive newcomer at Kempton (Polytrack) in December, both over 1m; that very much sets the standard in this field and 1m2f is likely to help; unraced stablemate Magical Treasure could pose problems, on paper, so their market strength needs a close look.

🔦 Spotlight: Last of ten at Lingfield (1m2f) at turn of the year; much better when making most with blinkers in maiden at Kempton (1m3f, again Polytrack; 20-1) 17 days later but she still needs to raise her game markedly and seems to need some persuasion; cheekpieces this time.

💬 Comment: Very much sets the standard; on paper, unraced stablemate Magical Treasure is interesting
🔦 Spotlight: Fair form when beaten 4l at Newmarket last September and again when no match for an impressive newcomer at Kempton (Polytrack) in December, both over 1m; that very much sets the standard in this field and 1m2f is likely to help; unraced stablemate Magical Treasure could pose problems, on paper, so their market strength needs a close look.
