🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back from wind surgery; relatively low mileage and has possibilities if staying the trip
🔦 Spotlight: 4yo with Flat (1m3f, soft/heavy) and hurdles (2m, good) wins to his name; beaten at odds-on at Newcastle (2m4f, good) on latest start but ran respectably on the figures; returns from wind surgery over a much longer distance; relatively low mileage and has possibilities if he stays.
Horse quote: 2024-05-16 at Limerick (11.5f): "Cruden is a big horse who's really starting to fill into himself and is learning on the job. When Shane got him out into the open he didn't really know what to do but he really ground it out to the line - Kate Harrington, assistant trainer."
