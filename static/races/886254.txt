🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Back up 5lb for last time's Wincanton win (good to soft), but jumping issues concern more.

🔦 Spotlight: Over 3l clear of Dunstall Rambler when a perhaps fortuitous winner of an identical C&D event in November (good), but miles behind that rival latest; may be as reliant on a dryout as positive effects of wind surgery.
