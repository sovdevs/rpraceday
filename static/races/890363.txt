🔦 Spotlight: Form took off when returned to 7f last autumn and he ended the year with three wins from his last four runs; back up in the weights ahead of his return and could prove vulnerable.
Horse quote: 2024-11-09 at Doncaster (7f): "It Just Takes Time made it look easy and relished the ground. It slowed the others down but he's a very simple ride. I popped him out and drop the hands and that's his style. He hits a flat spot but never gives up. He's very game - Olivia Tubb, jockey."

Horse quote: 2024-09-16 at Thirsk (7f): "I said to Connor [Beasley, jockey] that the last time Count Palatine ran we sat him handy and I didn't feel he enjoyed that so I said to just drop him in and ride him to finish.

🔦 Spotlight: 7f win at Newcastle in November and he has run several good races at that track since, second of nine in a Class 5 there two weeks ago; more needed back up in grade and he's not the most straightforward (can pull hard).
Horse quote: 2023-09-19 at Listowel (7f): "Starliner has been running with credit. We thought he had a chance but he had to do the hard work on his own which leaves you vulnerable. He was good and tough - Gavin Ryan, rider."
