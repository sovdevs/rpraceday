🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Return of a visor saw him win easily at Wolverhampton last week; 3lb well in; 🔥 big player
🔦 Spotlight: Back to form with a bang when powering home to win at Wolverhampton (8.6f) nine days ago; the return of the visor was clearly a big help there and the runner-up was a well-handicapped sort himself so the form looks solid; 3lb well in under his penalty; strong claims.

🔦 Spotlight: Chasing a course hat-trick after two 7f wins, the latest last week; 2lb wrong under a penalty but he's not handicapped out of things on his form from 12 months ago; stays 1m but all four wins have been at the shorter trip (0-27 over 1m+).
