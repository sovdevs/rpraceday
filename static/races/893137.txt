🔦 Spotlight: Took a step forward when stepped up in trip at Punchestown on his penultimate outing, finishing fifth of 21 (beaten 27l); not as good on quicker ground dropped to 2m at this venue since; not ruled out if the first-time cheekpieces have the desired effect back up in trip.

🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Step forward at Punchestown 2 starts ago when 5th; not as good on quicker ground since
🔦 Spotlight: Took a step forward when stepped up in trip at Punchestown on his penultimate outing, finishing fifth of 21 (beaten 27l); not as good on quicker ground dropped to 2m at this venue since; not ruled out if the first-time cheekpieces have the desired effect back up in trip.
