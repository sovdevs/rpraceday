📝L2 Comment: took keen hold, in rear, jumped right 5th, dropped to last 4 out, no chance from 3 out, kept on run-in (inquiry into running and riding; jockey stated that his instructions were to sit three quarters of the way back in field and ride gelding to best finishing position; he further added that his mount was very green, backing off and that he felt he would be tailed off at end of back straight but once he ran past a horse or two that he finished well past tired horses; vet said gelding coughed three times when being examined and has a graze on inside of left hind fetlock but otherwise was post race normal)
