🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: Has high-class pedigree; won useful 7f Newmarket maiden on debut in October
🔦 Spotlight: By a leading sire and half-brother to three Graded/Group-race winners for these connections including two at the top level; dam won Listed race for them; 9-4, narrowly made winning debut in useful 7f Newmarket maiden (good to soft) in October; this is a low-key return, up in trip on quicker ground, with a hood added, and he doesn't hold any big-race entries, but smart potential; 7lb penalty.
Horse quote: 2024-10-05 at Newmarket (7f): "Secret Theory is a nice horse with a pedigree to die for. There is improvement in him as he only came to hand six weeks ago but I think we'll put him away after that - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

💬 Comment: Useful form in two 1m Ayr novices last year including a win; should go well
🔦 Spotlight: Useful form in two 1m Ayr novices (good ground both times) last year, winning on debut, close second next time; the horse who defeated him was getting 7lb and holds Group-race entries; is himself entered in Group 2 Dante; 7lb penalty.
Horse quote: 2024-09-19 at Ayr (8f): "Hornsea Bay looked impressive. His home work had been pretty good. If you debut them over a mile at this time of year you like to think they'll stay ten furlongs and maybe a mile and a half. We might run him in another novice for experience. He could be nice next year, he's got a good pedigree as well - David O'Meara, trainer."

🔦 Spotlight: Just fair form in narrowly winning 1m AW Southwell maiden on second start, but picked up well off a steady pace and this May foal has plenty of room for improvement for top yard; 7lb penalty.
