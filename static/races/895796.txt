🗞️ **PRESS OPINION**
💬 Comment: 25-1 for debut over 6f but stayed on after trouble in running, may go well up in trip
🔦 Spotlight: Sioux Nation filly sent off at 25-1 on debut at Naas (6f, gd-yld) but she showed promise, staying on late after dwelling at the start and meeting trouble in running; speedily bred but worth a go at this trip on the evidence of her debut; could go well.
