💬 Comment: Recent novice winner; raised 6lb ahead of handicap debut and doubt he's thrown in
🔦 Spotlight: Five-time Flat winner who got off the mark in an eventful 2m1f novice hurdle at Sedgefield (good); doubt he's thrown for this handicap debut after a 6lb rise but does at least come here on a high.
